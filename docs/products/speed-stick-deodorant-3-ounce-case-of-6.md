      <li>When the wife is happy I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Great value for the product to cost ratio.</li>
      <li>Great odor protection and a timeless scent.</li>
      <li>Smells great, my wife likes the smell as well.</li>
      <li>They work great and are a good deal.</li>
      <li>/&gt;a couple of hours at best nothing more.</li>
      <li>/&gt;that made those deodorant sticks pleasant to use and gave them all-day effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;Colgate</li>
      <li>, it does a good job, and I like the scent.  </li>
      <li>THIS STUF KEEPS YOU SMELLING GOOD ALL DAY AND KEEPS THE STINK AWAY</li>
      <li>Good price/value; received as advertised and promptly.</li>
      <li>A good way to stock up semi-annually that saves a trip to the market.</li>
      <li>after a good bathroom, you put this deodorante and feel really fresh and good smell !</li>
      <li>It is effective at killing stink.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice smell when you apply it.  </li>
      <li>Good product, used for many years, nice way to buy.</li>
      <li>This is a clean and fresh-smelling deodorant that does a good job of minimizing body odor for a 12 hours or so.  </li>
      <li>Sure, it might cover the smell, but</li>
      <li>the best deodorant i use at the last 4 years!!!</li>
      <li>Those organic ones are ok but are pricey</li>
      <li>have been ok.</li>
      <li>However, this is more of a cover up and doesnt have anything in it even organic that fights bacteria odor.</li>
      <li>Palmolive, the maker of those deos removed the Triclosan and instead added more and stronger</li>
      <li>Better price point and saved myself a trip to the store.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product while living in the US and love it-the products here just don&#x27;t compare.</li>
      <li>He has a skin sensitivity to most deodorant/anti-perspirants, so this works for him.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This is still my favorite of all the Mennen Speed Sticks.</li>
      <li>Works well, reasonably priced, smells good.</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t wear off easily..</li>
      <li>Strong perfume for&lt;br</li>
      <li>For as long as I can remember buying my own deodorant I have always bought Speed Stick as it was and still is a good buy just look for it on sale at a store</li>
      <li>If you perspire little, and tend to get irritation from strong deodorant, this might be the perfect product for you.</li>
      <li>Ok, it&#x27;s worth a try.  </li>
      <li>Only deodorant I can use, since it does a great job and does not make my underarms itch.</li>
      <li>AND THAT SHOULD BE GOOD REASON ENOUGH TO PURCHASE MORE...</li>
      <li>Clean.  </li>
      <li>is why: The old Speed Sticks used to contain Triclosan - an effective antibacterial ingredient</li>
      <li>Another tried and true product for my husband.</li>
      <li>Now, I&#x27;ve spent many (probably too many) hours enjoying my new, more discrete scent</li>
      <li>Best of all, dousing my entire upper body in Stetson used to give me headaches (like migraines) about once a week.</li>
      <li>They were effective in warm &amp; humid weather but not too heavily perfumed - the way it should be, in my opinion.</li>
      <li>I think the price was comparable and the delivery was quick.</li>
      <li>He has been a loyal fan for over 25 years.</li>
      <li>Keeps me smelling good all day long</li>
      <li>The product shipped fast and accurately.</li>
      <li>I used to love the old Speed Stick mens deodorants.</li>
      <li>an antibacterial ingredient like Right Guard Sport or Right Guard</li>
      <li>First, my skin breaks out from the aluminum chlorhydrate that is supposed to prevent sweating under the arms and, second, it has never been effective.  </li>
      <li>and I could smell my own BO long before the day was over.  </li>
      <li>The smell can be a little overpowering when you first put it on, but overall a great product!</li>
      <li>Mennen stick deodorant came in various fragrances, some of which I liked more than others, but they all worked because they contained triclosan, an antibacterial ingredient that kept bacteria from building up all day long so that a thriving, odiferous colony of them was growing in my armpits by the end of the work day.  </li>
      <li>When I got married, my wife suggested I try Speed Stick.  </li>
      <li>At first I was somewhat apprehensive; my father in law being 30 years</li>
      <li>Crisp.  </li>
      <li>Thanks, Speedstick, for being consistent.</li>
      <li>I bought a couple sticks of the regular scent because it was really cheap at walmart.  </li>
      <li>It really irritates my armpits.  </li>
      <li>So, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, Mennen stick deodorant isn&#x27;t worth two cents, let alone what they charge for it.  </li>
      <li>won&#x27;t deny that it&#x27;s pricy, and moving over to another ABOS (anti-body-odor system) can be scary, but Mennen is truly easy, powerful, and stylish.</li>
      <li>literally took longer for me to pour out my cologne, than it did for me to get my new deoderant out of its box and smeared in my armpits!</li>
      <li>I think amazon is on the high side</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>my senior and using this product didn&#x27;t help much with the persuading of a young 20 something to try this product.  </li>
      <li>Speed Stick changed their product and it no longer works more than a few hours.&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, he is sensitive to this particular deodorant.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Never melts, even when left in a hot car</li>
      <li>Cautiously, carefully, I pressed the cool greenness into my hairy cavern of arm-torso, and waited.  </li>
      <li>I tried Tom&#x27;s and Trader Joe&#x27;s natural deodorant but neither of those worked</li>
      <li>It simply is no longer capable of doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
      <li>like the fact that this product hasn&#x27;t changed much since I started using it in the mid 1980s.  </li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin, this product is for you.</li>
      <li>Old Spice loves to advertise in their commercials about smelling and being manly, but I found that Speed Stick Regular is THE classic man smell.  </li>
      <li>The same situation also happened with the Old Spice High Endurance Deodorant: Used to be good&lt;</li>
      <li>have a hard time getting this in our local stores also, so I&#x27;m glad to find it at Amazon.</li>
      <li>and I barely have to turn the dial, just use the tiniest amount.</li>
      <li>The new &amp; allegedly &#x27;improved&#x27; products are identical in name only - no more effectiveness but lots of strong perfume.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I continued by gently placing my nostrils over the calm, green, glowing stick, and inhaled slightly.  </li>
      <li>The graphic designers produced a sharp packinging scheme and since the directions are in large print, I&#x27;m never straining my eyes.</li>

<li> but it doesn&#x27;t last, and there&#x27;s 0 deodorising going on once the perfumeyness dies down.</li>
<li> usually use Mitchum and the same bottle will last me a year, don&#x27;t even have to apply it every day</li>
<li> I like them although I haven&#x27;t used any other brand for a long time.</li>
<li> Stinks to high heaven when you put it on, a real headache inducing perfumey funk, it wouldn&#x27;t be bad if it weren&#x27;t so incredibly strong.</li>
<li> Plain old regular deodorant with no Aluminum Oxide - hard to find these days.</li>
<li> I could be wrong check prices first.</li>
<li> After years of getting boils and other nasties under my armpit</li>
<li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a small package, so I (finally) have room on my vanity.</li>
<li> I wafted the fumes from above the opening of the dispenser, but alas, it was not enough for my olfactory to detect.  </li>
<li> Based on my buying the same item in the store I feel I saved at least $4.00.</li>
<li> As I lifted my arm, I felt a slight quiver from the hairs waiting earnestly.  </li>
<li> I stink soo much less when I use</li>
<li> And if you don&#x27;t want deoderant because of its less manly smell, then you can still use the Mennen to keep the stains out of your shirts but still pour cologne over yourself to let the chicks know your the manliest man in town.</li>
<li> Speed stick makes me stink less.  </li>
<li> Cant go wrong with this classic scent.</li>
<li> The smell is not overpowering and it is not noticeable after a few minutes (I have smell sensitivity).  </li>
<li> I definitely wasted my money here, there is just no point to even wearing this.</li>
<li> Unfortunately the tradeoff for me is that it only lasts a few hours.</li>
<li> Then, I started seeing pictures of this new Speed Stick and started feeling incredibly frustrated with my cologne.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
<li> But because I&#x27;m cheap and insane, and must use up everything I buy, I will be having irritated armpits for a while.</li>
<li> As to preventing odor, antiperspirants, at least in my case, don&#x27;t.  </li>
<li> The delivery/packaging system is slick!  </li>
<li> you buy this expecting all-day effectiveness you&#x27;re in for some disappointment.</li>
<li> This Mennen product has no aluminium and is almost impossible to get in Australia.  </li>
<li> Would this prove to be another painful ordeal, rife with pain and hours of torment?  </li>
<li> /&gt;they removed the Triclosan, now is a crap product.</li>
<li> a nasty would eventually appear.</li>

    <li> For YEARS I tried finding a deodorant that wouldn&#x27;t cause my skin to burn and be irritated after zealous application.  When I got married, my wife suggested I try Speed Stick.  That&#x27;s what her dad uses, and she said it might work for me.  At first I was somewhat apprehensive; my father in law being 30 years my senior and using this product didn&#x27;t help much with the persuading of a young 20 something to try this product.  I wafted the fumes from above the opening of the dispenser, but alas, it was not enough for my olfactory to detect.  I continued by gently placing my nostrils over the calm, green, glowing stick, and inhaled slightly.  Clean.  Crisp.  Ok, it&#x27;s worth a try.  As I lifted my arm, I felt a slight quiver from the hairs waiting earnestly.  Would this prove to be another painful ordeal, rife with pain and hours of torment?  Sure, it might cover the smell, but at what cost?  Cautiously, carefully, I pressed the cool greenness into my hairy cavern of arm-torso, and waited.  No stinging.  No redness.  No irritation.  My quest for the perfect deodorant ended that fateful day when I rubbed this glorious product into the pit of my arm.  Blessed be the name of Speed Stick.</li>
    <li> Speed Stick changed their product and it no longer works more than a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;Useless.</li>
    <li> I have been using Speed Stick for years. I stink soo much less when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try.</li>
    <li> This is the best-smelling, least-irritating deodorant product I have ever used. Unfortunately the tradeoff for me is that it only lasts a few hours. If you perspire little, and tend to get irritation from strong deodorant, this might be the perfect product for you. If you perspire a lot (like me), and have to be around people a lot during the day (like me), you&#x27;ll probably want to find something stronger.</li>
    <li> I bought a couple sticks of the regular scent because it was really cheap at walmart.  Never again...  It really irritates my armpits.  But because I&#x27;m cheap and insane, and must use up everything I buy, I will be having irritated armpits for a while.</li>
    <li> They work great and are a good deal.</li>
    <li> the best deodorant i use at the last 4 years!!! i dont want to change, the smell..hummm...is perfect ! after a good bathroom, you put this deodorante and feel really fresh and good smell !</li>
    <li> For as long as I can remember buying my own deodorant I have always bought Speed Stick as it was and still is a good buy just look for it on sale at a store I think amazon is on the high side I could be wrong check prices first.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it does not contain aluminum, which has been linked to memory loss. It is convenient to buy it this way rather than trying to find a big box or pharmacy that actually stocks it.</li>
    <li> For years I struggled with irritation from deodorants and antiperspirants.  The irritation would leave me red and actually clammy; the opposite effect one is looking for with a deodorant.  Once I tried regular speed stick, I was hooked.  I haven&#x27;t had a problem since and have recommended it to friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only caveat would be that this is not for men who sweat profusely.  For that you need an antiperspirant (because antiperspirants contain aluminum oxide which actually clogs your pores).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Never melts, even when left in a hot car&lt;br /&gt;Reasonable price&lt;br /&gt;Manly neutral smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Better at blocking odor than wetness</li>
    <li> After years of getting boils and other nasties under my armpit i finally figured out it was deodorant causing it. How i find out i went a year without using any. I then resumed using it then a nasty would eventually appear. I then stopped and the problem went away. So it seems like i have some type of sensitivity to Aluminum based deodorant. Those organic ones are ok but are pricey and i have to order them. I went back to Speed Stick an have been ok. However, this is more of a cover up and doesnt have anything in it even organic that fights bacteria odor. It just enough to get me through the day. I can feel however it giving away at about the 10 hour mark. So if you are going out i suggest reapplying. Cant go wrong with this classic scent.</li>
    <li> Works well. I sweat a lot and some deodorants just arnt up to the job. This one is. The smell can be a little overpowering when you first put it on, but overall a great product!</li>
    <li> This is a clean and fresh-smelling deodorant that does a good job of minimizing body odor for a 12 hours or so.  My husband uses it liberally each morning, it does a good job, and I like the scent.  It does not contain the iffy aluminium ingredient that may or may not contribute to alzheimer&#x27;s or cancer in the long term.</li>
    <li> I never owned deoderant before. Then, I started seeing pictures of this new Speed Stick and started feeling incredibly frustrated with my cologne.&lt;br /&gt;It literally took longer for me to pour out my cologne, than it did for me to get my new deoderant out of its box and smeared in my armpits! The delivery/packaging system is slick!  The use of the plastic container to apply a gelatinous substance is the simplest anti-body-odor-system I have ever encountered. I&#x27;m sweating and farting without any lingering odors.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a small package, so I (finally) have room on my vanity. The graphic designers produced a sharp packinging scheme and since the directions are in large print, I&#x27;m never straining my eyes. Best of all, dousing my entire upper body in Stetson used to give me headaches (like migraines) about once a week. Now, I&#x27;ve spent many (probably too many) hours enjoying my new, more discrete scent and I haven&#x27;t had a headache since buying it!&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t deny that it&#x27;s pricy, and moving over to another ABOS (anti-body-odor system) can be scary, but Mennen is truly easy, powerful, and stylish. And if you don&#x27;t want deoderant because of its less manly smell, then you can still use the Mennen to keep the stains out of your shirts but still pour cologne over yourself to let the chicks know your the manliest man in town.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Speed Stick deodorant regular for years.  It is effective at killing stink.  It has a nice smell when you apply it.  The smell is not overpowering and it is not noticeable after a few minutes (I have smell sensitivity).  This product does not stain clothes or leave any marks.  I tried Tom&#x27;s and Trader Joe&#x27;s natural deodorant but neither of those worked and I could smell my own BO long before the day was over.  While I like to buy products that have no animal testing, I draw the line with BO and use my Speed Stick deodorant.  It&#x27;s great for men or women and it&#x27;s inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I used to love the old Speed Stick mens deodorants. They were effective in warm &amp; humid weather but not too heavily perfumed - the way it should be, in my opinion. The new &amp; allegedly &#x27;improved&#x27; products are identical in name only - no more effectiveness but lots of strong perfume.&lt;br /&gt;This is why: The old Speed Sticks used to contain Triclosan - an effective antibacterial ingredient&lt;br /&gt;that made those deodorant sticks pleasant to use and gave them all-day effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;Colgate Palmolive, the maker of those deos removed the Triclosan and instead added more and stronger&lt;br /&gt;perfume. The same situation also happened with the Old Spice High Endurance Deodorant: Used to be good&lt;br /&gt;they removed the Triclosan, now is a crap product. I will not buy this again instead will get a deo&lt;br /&gt;with an antibacterial ingredient like Right Guard Sport or Right Guard Total Defense 5.&lt;br /&gt;If you buy this expecting all-day effectiveness you&#x27;re in for some disappointment. Strong perfume for&lt;br /&gt;a couple of hours at best nothing more. Not recommended!</li>
    <li> Better price point and saved myself a trip to the store. Based on my buying the same item in the store I feel I saved at least $4.00.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product while living in the US and love it-the products here just don&#x27;t compare. Definately be a returning customer.</li>
    <li> This stuff just doesn&#x27;t work. Unsurprisingly the reviews seem to suggest that the active ingredient Triclosan has been removed, and you can definitely feel it&#x27;s lack. If you&#x27;re looking for a deodorant that works and doesn&#x27;t have triclosan, Mitchum Power Gel doesn&#x27;t according to its ingredient list on Amazon, though it does have aluminum, fyi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use Mitchum and the same bottle will last me a year, don&#x27;t even have to apply it every day and I barely have to turn the dial, just use the tiniest amount. They were out this last time and I grabbed Speed Stick, I see it in a lot of dudes&#x27; bathrooms...mistake. Stinks to high heaven when you put it on, a real headache inducing perfumey funk, it wouldn&#x27;t be bad if it weren&#x27;t so incredibly strong. but it doesn&#x27;t last, and there&#x27;s 0 deodorising going on once the perfumeyness dies down. I definitely wasted my money here, there is just no point to even wearing this.</li>
    <li> Once upon a time, Mennen Speed Stick Deodorant was a great product.  I can&#x27;t use an &amp;#34;antiperspirant&amp;#34; for two reasons.  First, my skin breaks out from the aluminum chlorhydrate that is supposed to prevent sweating under the arms and, second, it has never been effective.  I put that stuff on and I sweat anyway.  As to preventing odor, antiperspirants, at least in my case, don&#x27;t.  So I started using deodorants.  Mennen stick deodorant came in various fragrances, some of which I liked more than others, but they all worked because they contained triclosan, an antibacterial ingredient that kept bacteria from building up all day long so that a thriving, odiferous colony of them was growing in my armpits by the end of the work day.  (You could also find triclosan in various brands of deodorant soap.)  Then, suddenly, triclosan was vilified for reasons I never quite understood, and instead of replacing it with some other antibacterial ingredient, Mennen simply started leaving it out of their deodorant sticks.  Of course, they stopped working.  So all these &amp;#34;deodorant&amp;#34; sticks have become and are now is a solid cologne and the fragrance is supposed to mask the armpit odor that it no longer prevents.  So, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, Mennen stick deodorant isn&#x27;t worth two cents, let alone what they charge for it.  It simply is no longer capable of doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> THIS STUF KEEPS YOU SMELLING GOOD ALL DAY AND KEEPS THE STINK AWAY AND THAT SHOULD BE GOOD REASON ENOUGH TO PURCHASE MORE...</li>
    <li> Came just as promised</li>
    <li> Plain old regular deodorant with no Aluminum Oxide - hard to find these days. Works well, reasonably priced, smells good.</li>
    <li> Another tried and true product for my husband. He has a skin sensitivity to most deodorant/anti-perspirants, so this works for him.&lt;br /&gt;I have a hard time getting this in our local stores also, so I&#x27;m glad to find it at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Speed stick makes me stink less.  My wife seems to like when I don&#x27;t stink.  When the wife is happy I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that this product hasn&#x27;t changed much since I started using it in the mid 1980s.  It hides my funk today just as well as it did back then.  Thanks, Speedstick, for being consistent.</li>
    <li> Keeps me smelling good all day long and it doesn&#x27;t wear off easily..</li>
    <li> Good product, used for many years, nice way to buy.</li>
    <li> The product shipped fast and accurately. This is still my favorite of all the Mennen Speed Sticks. Great value for the product to cost ratio. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This Mennen product has no aluminium and is almost impossible to get in Australia.  I get a rash from continued use of aluminium.</li>
    <li> What can on say?  This is a bargain.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 40 years, and will continue to us for another 40 if I can.</li>
    <li> Good price/value; received as advertised and promptly. A good way to stock up semi-annually that saves a trip to the market.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years so it was a no brainer to buy it on line rather that making a dedicated trip to the store.  I think the price was comparable and the delivery was quick.</li>
    <li> The best ... I&#x27;ve been a user for over 50 years.</li>
    <li> Only deodorant I can use, since it does a great job and does not make my underarms itch. If you have sensitive skin, this product is for you.</li>
    <li> Meet expectations 100%</li>
    <li> My fianc&amp;eacute; loves this brand. He has been a loyal fan for over 25 years. However, he is sensitive to this particular deodorant. I will be returning them and purchasing a non scented one.</li>
    <li> Old Spice loves to advertise in their commercials about smelling and being manly, but I found that Speed Stick Regular is THE classic man smell.  Great odor protection and a timeless scent.</li>
    <li> I like them although I haven&#x27;t used any other brand for a long time. Smells great, my wife likes the smell as well. Last all day.</li>
    <li> Tengo mas de 20 a&amp;ntilde;os utilizando este Producto, para mi es excelente . . . . . . . . .</li>
    <li> It is my deodorant , since 1970.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  43 years of continuos use, without any problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I recomend, by my experience.</li>
