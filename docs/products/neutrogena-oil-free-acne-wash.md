      <li>so I higly recommend this just keep doing it and the result will be amazing :)    </li>
      <li>It was good because it was oil free, but its not a solution to acne you need a benzol peroxide or salicylic acid treatment to cure most acne.</li>
      <li>My skin eventually peeled and now it&#x27;s finally better.  </li>
      <li>Peroxide (you can use any of ur favorite company&#x27;s)</li>
      <li>use any of your favorite scrubs 2-3 time a week to remove dead-skin and others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>This product is ok.</li>
      <li>ok wel</li>
      <li>It seems i get more acne.</li>
      <li>and it never seemed to make my acne better.</li>
      <li>if you use it at night too that would be better.</li>
      <li>The good thing about the Neutrogena is it&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
      <li>So, allow the warm washcloth to sit on your face until it turns cool...</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s been helpful to let the cleanser sit on the skin for maybe 30 seconds before rinsing off, then make sure all cleanser is removed and blot don&#x27;t rub with a clean cloth :)</li>
      <li>Neutrogena Moisture Oil Free Formula, SPF 15 - 4 oz]]&lt;br /&gt;3-[[ASIN:</li>
      <li>before I started using the Neutrogena oil free acne wash.</li>
      <li>This&#x27;ll make your skin smooth in a jiffy.</li>
      <li>This step is extremely important shouldn&#x27;t be skipped</li>
      <li>Opening your pores when cleansing is important b/c</li>
      <li>skin is so polished and smooth now...</li>
      <li>My skin is so polished and smooth now...</li>
      <li>, I would not recommend this as a cure for acne at all, but as a nice acne prevention and soft wash for those of you with healthy skin.</li>
      <li>Okay, if you have acne, this product probably won&#x27;t help very much.</li>
      <li>Acid\\&quot; at first you will break out more WHY?&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Just remember skin is so unique and what works for one person can be downright ineffective for another.</li>
      <li>The first thing you should do to avoid acne is stop randomly touching your face throughout the day...</li>
      <li>it allows the cleansing agent direct access to your pores to cleanse them effectively.  </li>
      <li>and it really has helped me stay Acne free without drying me out!</li>
      <li>i have like mild to moderat acne</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m getting tremendous results</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m getting tremendous results</li>
      <li>I really, really like the Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash</li>
      <li>(using warm water will open the pores up)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It makes a gentle lather, it cuts through the grease to make sure any grease and dried-up oil are removed from my face gently.</li>
      <li>They were really tiny, and you could barely notice them, but with bright light, you could see them.  </li>
      <li>I stopped using it right away.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Third, get a good cleansing method down pat.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Leaves your skin nice dry and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Be very gentle..</li>
      <li>The first day was alright.  </li>
      <li>so after finishing steaming for 10 minutes you could use the Scrub first if you want and then the Acne Wash or u could just use the Acne Wash).&lt;br</li>
      <li>your face with the scrubs first then the Acne Wash) then apply Benzoyl Peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normal</li>
      <li>first 3 weeks just use it at night (1 time a day) after the 3 weeks twice a day ( Morning and Night)&lt;br</li>
      <li>For me, when I use this cleanser...first I wet my face with warm water...</li>
      <li>rinse the cloth in hot water and repeat this about 3 times....</li>
      <li>First cleanse your face with the acne wash as I said</li>
      <li>Kaz has a facial steamer listed on amazon that gets outstanding reviews</li>
      <li>Do this for only about a minute at most.  </li>
      <li>I first started using this</li>
      <li>this seem good one from neutrogena    and for the scrub use a one for a Sensitive and Dry Skin.    </li>
      <li>then I put a wet warm washcloth on my face to loosen the grime (oil/dirt) that you can&#x27;t really see.  </li>
      <li>There are a lot of other cleansers that are oil free, but they don&#x27;t advertise that they are oil free.</li>
      <li>you have very very light cases of acne (meaning you hardly ever get breakouts, but if you do, they&#x27;re never red or inflamed and are only visible under bright light)</li>
      <li>Any more often that that will lead to extremely dry irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I first began using this product in high school.</li>
      <li>He said that nobody should ever wash their face with this, and recommended a different cleanser that was gentle AND oil free.    </li>
      <li>Then I noticed my skin really drying out.  </li>
      <li>The texture of my skin really began to deteriorate.  </li>
      <li>also I dont really have acne</li>
      <li>I can put straight 10% benzoyl peroxide on it every day, even twice a day, without problems.</li>
      <li>It does not help acne as much as it probably should.</li>
      <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s TOO gentle of a cleanser... &lt;br /&gt;</li>
      <li>I really really really regret buying it now.</li>
      <li>Keep your pillow cases free of bacteria through regular cleaning.  </li>
      <li>If you do, you&#x27;ll be putting bacteria and germs straight into your pores again...like being re-infected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Remember to use a different towel than the one you&#x27;ve been using now that your face is free from all that bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I never thought my skin was possible to start looking like smooth porcelain.  </li>
      <li>I never thought my skin was possible to start looking like smooth porcelain.  </li>
      <li>The sides of my nose and my chin area would hurt from so much dryness.</li>
      <li>acne is more severe than that, mostly due to my incessant picking (doesn&#x27;t everyone???</li>
      <li>It also keeps your face oil free but doesn&#x27;t dry out your hands when you use it.</li>
      <li>so I alternate it with Neutrogena&#x27;s Fresh Foaming Cleanser that is quite gentle.</li>
      <li>This wash cleared up my daily breakouts when nothing else could, and the price is so reasonable that it&#x27;s really worth a shot.</li>
      <li>i always had VERY CLEAR skin my whole life.</li>
      <li>But if it rinses clean, and makes your skin feel good (instead of burning or tight or dried out), you&#x27;re in the clear.</li>
      <li>/&gt;*Always use warm water when washing your face at first then clean it with cold water so the pores will close up</li>
      <li>It seemed to leave my skin refreshed and clean at first but shortly leave my skin dry in certain areas.</li>
      <li>I do not have sensitive skin at all -- my skin is, in fact, very hardy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle and completely trustworthy for me.</li>
      <li>Wal-Mart or Walgreens everyday for many years</li>
      <li>It left my skin feeling kind of tight afterwards, stripping my skin of all oil.  </li>
      <li>so this skin will fall off creating new skin and this process will cause your acne markes to fade.  </li>
      <li>Maybe I have very sensitive skin, but this product tore my skin up.  </li>
      <li>My face became very sensitive to touch and was/is still rather itchy throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>If I use this twice a day - every morning and evening - and follow other standard acne prevention tips (changing my pillowcase daily, being gentle when washing, etc), I honestly can keep my acne completely at bay.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This will only be on the first 2 weeks&lt;br</li>
      <li>any water left on the face (Due to the steam) use tissue better.  </li>
      <li>I am a fifteen year old and I have used this product for years and it always burns my skin!</li>
      <li>I bought this product from Walgreens just the other day and was excited to try it.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s important to note that with acne products your skin can seem to flare up the first few days with initial treatment as it adjusts to the product or is clearing out underlying acne that was about to emerge.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read other reviews, dry skin and sensitive one seem to have problem with this product, it&#x27;s okay</li>

      <li>Maybe my skin is just too sensitive, but I&#x27;ve always had problems with drying/peeling to the extent where patches of my skin will be paler in the summers because of the peeling.</li>
      <li>My face is completely burned.</li>
      <li>Allow me to introduce myself, I&#x27;m 28 yrs old and \\&quot;just started\\</li>
      <li>Now that you&#x27;ve just stripped your face completely of all of its natural oil, you must Use some TONER immediately.  </li>
      <li>Put a big towel over your head while steaming to keep the steam going straight into your face.</li>
      <li>After switching to the new cleanser, my skin was completely back to normal in just under 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>and this is very important to be used seriously because if you didn&#x27;t moisture your face acne will get</li>
      <li>It only burned a little when I first started using it, but by the end of the first week it felt like I was washing my face with oven cleaner every night and morning.    </li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin that easily breaks out and goes wack when I least expect it.</li>
      <li>my skin is shine free no more dabbing with oil sheets during the day.</li>

    <li> This product is horrible!  I couldn&#x27;t even use it for a week.  Maybe I have very sensitive skin, but this product tore my skin up.  The first day was alright.  It left my skin feeling kind of tight afterwards, stripping my skin of all oil.  The second day, my skin was red after using it.  I just figured that it was working.  Then I noticed my skin really drying out.  By the third day, I noticed hundreds of little whiteheads on my skin, covering my entire face.  They were really tiny, and you could barely notice them, but with bright light, you could see them.  The texture of my skin really began to deteriorate.  My skin was very dry, regardless of using moisturizer.  My friends even remarked about the redness of my face.  I stopped using it right away.  It took a week at least for my skin to recover from using the product.  My skin eventually peeled and now it&#x27;s finally better.  I went straight back to cetaphil, thank God.  AVOID this product!!! Especially if you have sensitive skin like me!</li>
    <li> i ususally DO NOT write reviews. But i had to on this item. My dermotologist told me to start using this due to break outs out of no where since i hit 25. i always had VERY CLEAR skin my whole life. maybe one or two pimples every 2 yrs!. so i went and started using this its been about 2 weeks and o my! my skin is shine free no more dabbing with oil sheets during the day. no more acne so far! plus i am on solodyn 80 mg. so that might be helping too. But all in all great product !</li>

    <li> This product is ok. Not the best but it is good if you just want to wash your face and have a refreshing feeling afterwords also I dont really have acne so I can&#x27;t say it doesn&#x27;t work but I had a few pimples and I didn&#x27;t think that the wash made them go because they were on my face for 5 days. But I had a scar on my forehead from riding my bike and I noticed that the cleanser is slowly making it go away.</li>
    <li> I find this product to be effective for its purpose. I have acne prone skin that tends be on the sensitive side. This wash has been helpful to minimize breakouts. The 2% salicylic acid is the standard amount I&#x27;ve usually found in products used for acne. The salicylic acid is helpful in unplugging blocked skin pores allowing breakouts to heal. It should also help reduce swelling and inflammation of the skin. I have noticed that for me using it every single day, morning and night seems to be a bit rough on my skin (dryness, sensitive around the eyes) so I alternate it with Neutrogena&#x27;s Fresh Foaming Cleanser that is quite gentle. I think it&#x27;s important to note that with acne products your skin can seem to flare up the first few days with initial treatment as it adjusts to the product or is clearing out underlying acne that was about to emerge. It can take several weeks before it seems to make a marked difference. However, I find it to be beneficial in my skin care routine when trying to keep flareups at bay. Just remember skin is so unique and what works for one person can be downright ineffective for another. Unfortunately, it seems to be trial and error to see what works for you. Researching ingredients and their effectiveness and side effects are key. Best of luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. it&#x27;s been helpful to let the cleanser sit on the skin for maybe 30 seconds before rinsing off, then make sure all cleanser is removed and blot don&#x27;t rub with a clean cloth :)</li>
    <li> PROS :-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your skin nice dry and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fights Acne well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No fragnance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO Fragnance.</li>
    <li> This product is, unfortunately, very bad for my skin and for the skin of some of my family members who have tried it. I do not have sensitive skin at all -- my skin is, in fact, very hardy. I can put straight 10% benzoyl peroxide on it every day, even twice a day, without problems. I can even do 10% benzoyl peroxide every morning and 2% salicylic acid toner every night, which is my current routine that has cured my acne. But before I found that routine, I was told to use this by 2 family members who had been told to use it by their dermatologist.     Frankly, this stuff turned my skin into a battleground between the T-zone, which suddenly became extremely oily, and the rest of my face, which suddenly became dry and flaky. Not to mention that I saw no reduction of acne at all. I kept with it for 3 weeks, thinking that maybe my skin needed to \\&quot;get used to it.\\&quot; No luck! It just got worse and worse. It only burned a little when I first started using it, but by the end of the first week it felt like I was washing my face with oven cleaner every night and morning.    Finally, my own first-ever dermatologist appointment came up, and I looked so bad he thought I had severe rosacea. Then I told him that my skin never looked like this (except for the acne) before I started using the Neutrogena oil free acne wash. The look on his face was... well, it was like I just told him I was washing my face with oven cleaner. He said that nobody should ever wash their face with this, and recommended a different cleanser that was gentle AND oil free.    After switching to the new cleanser, my skin was completely back to normal in just under 2 weeks. I told my aunt and cousin, who were using this stuff, what MY dermatologist said. They switched to other cleansers that did not burn or sting, and their skin stopped being sensitive too.     In conclusion: Please don&#x27;t use this stuff. Even if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, it can hurt your skin so bad that it becomes sensitive.     Instead, buy a cleanser that does not ever sting or burn or make your skin feel dry or tight after you wash it. There are a lot of other cleansers that are oil free, but they don&#x27;t advertise that they are oil free. The way you can tell if it will clog your pores is this: Does it rinse completely off my skin with water, or does it leave a filmy residue behind? Films and residues on your face will give you acne. But if it rinses clean, and makes your skin feel good (instead of burning or tight or dried out), you&#x27;re in the clear.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product that works really well on many types of complexions.  My wife and I both use it and like that it smells nice and seems to do the trick.  It also keeps your face oil free but doesn&#x27;t dry out your hands when you use it.</li>
    <li> I am a fifteen year old and I have used this product for years and it always burns my skin! Maybe my skin is just too sensitive, but I&#x27;ve always had problems with drying/peeling to the extent where patches of my skin will be paler in the summers because of the peeling. It does not help acne as much as it probably should. I have finally convinced my mom to switch brands... If you insist on using Neutrogena, opt for the acne lotions and use the spot treatment method.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous soaps, creams, masks, pads and other items in my quest to handle acne. I really, really like the Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash, In fact I currently keep 2 bottles of the soap in my bathroom. One is in my shower, to use when I&#x27;m taking a shower. The other is on my sink counter, to use for the parts of the day that I am not taking a shower.    The good thing about the Neutrogena is it&#x27;s very gentle. It makes a gentle lather, it cuts through the grease to make sure any grease and dried-up oil are removed from my face gently. It helps to make sure that there&#x27;s nothing on my skin to clog up the pores, without hurting or irritating the skin.    If I use this twice a day - every morning and evening - and follow other standard acne prevention tips (changing my pillowcase daily, being gentle when washing, etc), I honestly can keep my acne completely at bay. If I run out of the Neutrogena, the red spots start to come back.</li>
    <li> ok wel i have like mild to moderat acne and i got sick of looking at it so i herd that this product was good for clearing and getting rid of acne. I used this product for about 2 days and it seems like its doing nothis to help my face out. After i used it my face seemes to get worse. It seems i get more acne. Wel i want to know if anyone out there has any ideas on what to use for my face and what kind of stuff will get rid of my acne</li>
    <li> With pustular pimples in the past, my dermatologist recommended I use this face wash regularly in the morning. I have clear skin now and continue to use this product. It hasn&#x27;t failed me!</li>
    <li> Okay, if you have acne, this product probably won&#x27;t help very much. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you have very very light cases of acne (meaning you hardly ever get breakouts, but if you do, they&#x27;re never red or inflamed and are only visible under bright light) This&#x27;ll make your skin smooth in a jiffy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My acne is more severe than that, mostly due to my incessant picking (doesn&#x27;t everyone??? o_O) and so this product doesn&#x27;t help. I still use it though, but only once a week or less. For some reason, I found that if I used it too often, it lost its potency. Perhaps it&#x27;s TOO gentle of a cleanser... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I would not recommend this as a cure for acne at all, but as a nice acne prevention and soft wash for those of you with healthy skin.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed. I bought this product from Walgreens just the other day and was excited to try it. I really really really regret buying it now. My face is completely burned. It looks and feels like I have the worst sunburn ever. It&#x27;s so sore and my lips are dry/sore. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone! Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin, but by reading other reviews it&#x27;s happened to other people too. I&#x27;ve discontinued using it and I&#x27;ve e-mailed Neutrogena to express how disappointed I am. I have never been in this much pain before, it&#x27;s the worst feeling. Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
    <li> This acne wash is absolutely wonderful.  Let me explain to you how this product works.  Allow me to introduce myself, I&#x27;m 28 yrs old and \\&quot;just started\\&quot; a fight with acne.  As a result, I&#x27;ve done tremendous research to arm myself against this nasty little creature called acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, acne starts by oil clogging the pores and bacteria (dirt).  The first thing you should do to avoid acne is stop randomly touching your face throughout the day...resist to touch your face even if it itches.  Don&#x27;t even use your hands to allow your face/chin to rest.  Keep your hands away from your face at all costs.  You don&#x27;t want bacteria (dirt) to get in your pores.  You may want to get some antibacterial hand gel.  Keep your pillow cases free of bacteria through regular cleaning.  Clean makeup brushes at least once a week.  DO NOT use any products containing oil on your face.  Just like pouring cooking oil down the drain can clog it...so can oil clog up your skin and get trapped inside (creating a pimple).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, purchase \\&quot;all\\&quot; facial products that do not contain oil.  This fact should be advertised on the label.  If it&#x27;s not, don&#x27;t buy it.  Use this acne wash.  The wash works because it dries up the oil...which leads to pimples.  It addresses the problem at the root cause.  You have to use it at least two times per day (morning and night).  Any more often that that will lead to extremely dry irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, get a good cleansing method down pat. For me, when I use this cleanser...first I wet my face with warm water...then I put a wet warm washcloth on my face to loosen the grime (oil/dirt) that you can&#x27;t really see.  This step is extremely important shouldn&#x27;t be skipped b/c you are opening your pores.  Opening your pores when cleansing is important b/c it allows the cleansing agent direct access to your pores to cleanse them effectively.  So, allow the warm washcloth to sit on your face until it turns cool...rinse the cloth in hot water and repeat this about 3 times....letting it sit on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then apply the cleanser, massage it into your pores...don&#x27;t rub hard.  Allow it to sit about 30 seconds (until it begins to look like it&#x27;s drying out).  Then rinse.  Wash it again, then rinse.  When drying...do not use the same washcloth in the paragraph above.  If you do, you&#x27;ll be putting bacteria and germs straight into your pores again...like being re-infected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that you&#x27;ve cleansed...you want to get rid of that dry feeling.  Now that you&#x27;ve just stripped your face completely of all of its natural oil, you must Use some TONER immediately.  Then use some oil-free moisturizer...neutrogena makes one and it&#x27;s good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanse your face every single night and morning at a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that saclylic acid dries the skin...so this skin will fall off creating new skin and this process will cause your acne markes to fade.  You have to play an active role in this process in exfolitating your skin so that your skin does start looking dull...full of dry dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get a facial sauna/steamer...Do this treatment about 3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) First cleanse your face with the acne wash as I said above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) Steam your face for about 8 minutes. Put a big towel over your head while steaming to keep the steam going straight into your face. If you need a steamer...Kaz has a facial steamer listed on amazon that gets outstanding reviews so I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) Use a gentle soft facial brush to brush away the dead cells.  Be very gentle..this shouldn&#x27;t hurt at all.  Don&#x27;t pop any pimples...just brush the dead skin \\&quot;around\\&quot; the pimples.  Do this for only about a minute at most.  Before your face begins to dry up go to the next step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) Get back to your facial sauna.  Do it for about another 8 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(4) Cleanse your skin again with the acne wash to remove the dirt, oil, bacteria that just came out of your pores.  Remember to use a different towel than the one you&#x27;ve been using now that your face is free from all that bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll want to cleanse every night...but you&#x27;ll want to do the facial sauna/steamer ritual about 3 times a week...until you notice you stopped breaking out...then you can cut it down to about 2 night a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is so polished and smooth now...I never thought my skin was possible to start looking like smooth porcelain.  This acne wash is only \\&quot;one\\&quot; of the items you&#x27;ll need.  You need a zit remover...or something that&#x27;ll dry out the pimple when you get one.  I use Naturopathica blemish remover..it dries them out overnight.  You&#x27;ll also need two different types of moisturizer...a regular one without oil..and one that has an SPF to protect the skin during the daytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope my review has helped at least one person.  I wouldn&#x27;t have written such a long one if these things hadn&#x27;t worked for me.  I&#x27;m getting tremendous results and I just wanted to share my tips.all that bacteria.

    <li> It was good because it was oil free, but its not a solution to acne you need a benzol peroxide or salicylic acid treatment to cure most acne. I usually use proactive and I just baught this for my back and when I combine this with a treatment it usually gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I have severe acne. I have used this stuff/the off-brand of the same stuff-a.k.a. Wal-Mart or Walgreens everyday for many years and it never seemed to make my acne better. I was recommended by a dermatologist to use this stuff and that is why I kept using it long after I stopped seeing the dermatologist even though my problem was never solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just recently switched to bar soap and all of a sudden my acne cleared up! Just plain, basic bar soap! I realized then just how less oily a clean face was supposed to feel. I am now 21 and I had been using this stuff/off-brand since I was 12 or 13.</li>
    <li> So I reciently bought this about a 2 weeks ago. I have extremely sensitive skin that easily breaks out and goes wack when I least expect it. I first started using this just bc I thought I give it a go. It seemed to leave my skin refreshed and clean at first but shortly leave my skin dry in certain areas. I continued to use it and the drug areas worsened. The sides of my nose and my chin area would hurt from so much dryness. I used lotion, green tea lotion, tea tree oil and olive oil. NOTHING WOKRED! But I was determined to continue using this product. Well, my skin got so dry, it began to flake. It wasn&#x27;t until 4 said ago I found a lotion for sensitive skin and my skin is back on track.&lt;br /&gt;My redness is gone.&lt;br /&gt;My blackheads are clearing out.</li>
    <li> I first began using this product in high school. Since then, I&#x27;ve switched around a lot and in the process tried dozens of drug and department store acne washes/cleansers/creams. I always came back to the Oil-Free Acne Wash, and now I will NEVER trust my face with anything else. The effectiveness of acne medications and washes do vary a lot from person to person, so there&#x27;s no guarantee that this product will work for you. I&#x27;ve tried products that people have raved about or called miraculous, but I&#x27;ve usually achieved little success. This wash cleared up my daily breakouts when nothing else could, and the price is so reasonable that it&#x27;s really worth a shot. It&#x27;s gentle and completely trustworthy for me.</li>
    <li> i dont know if it works. but i always use it in the morning. if you use it at night too that would be better. but i dont.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and this product seriously irritated my skin.  My skin got extremely dry and it caused a rash similar to the look of heat rash on my face after 3 uses.  My face became very sensitive to touch and was/is still rather itchy throughout the day.  The instructions do advise reducing frequency of use if it dries out your skin, which it did, so I&#x27;ve done so and look forward to my skin clearing. But I will never purchase or use this product again.</li>
    <li> This wash does dry up acne, I will give it that but in the process it also dries out your skin so bad. I do have combo skin so I can be a little dry anyway but this just pushed me over the edge to the point of flaky red patchiness. My husband uses it (he has oily skin) and he loves it, However if you have dry skin I would not use this wash.. I switched to the Alpha Hydrox (See Review) wash and it really has helped me stay Acne free without drying me out!</li>
