      <li>Feels very comfortable in my arthritic hands.</li>
      <li>I prefer 1 inch and 3/4 inch iron better for me,</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it and have no intentions of converting to a ceramic.</li>
      <li>so why pay so much more for a ceramic?</li>
      <li>Love my curling iron.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ll use it sometimes but 1/2 inch mini irons are much better than this one.</li>
      <li>I like that this is for body more than curl.</li>
      <li>It works great, and the price was reasonable.</li>
      <li>and I love more than I did before.</li>

      <li>that i love and its been working for years&lt;</li>
      <li>BUT I got something even better that I wasn&#x27;t expecting....</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love Conair curling irons.</li>
      <li>But I began noticing the click button took more and more attempts to get it \\&quot;on\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line, you could do better.  </li>
      <li>Great price shipment came fast.</li>
      <li>I had another one like this for many years.  </li>
      <li>but i took the clamp off which i do with most of my curling irons because its just easier to use as a wand.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>Love love love this product...</li>
      <li>I love this curling iron.</li>
      <li>I love this produ t.</li>
      <li>but im glad i got this one.</li>
      <li>I love this</li>
      <li>how many you turn it.</li>
      <li>i love it</li>
      <li>Your hair has not looked that good in years!&amp;#34;  He is right.  </li>
      <li>It does a pretty good job.  </li>
      <li>Very nicely made and hold hair in tightly for great curls without burning.</li>
      <li>I read the reviews and they basically looked good and the price was reasonable.  </li>
      <li>Gets nice and hot, does so fairly quickly, and it is nice and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Other than that they work wonderful.</li>
      <li>The design of the handle makes this easy to use.</li>
      <li>I am giving this three stars because it doesn&#x27;t glide through hair as easily as their others.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use and leaves my hair with shiny curls.</li>
      <li>Make sure you order the right diameter barrel, and you will be pleased with the quality and price.</li>
      <li>LOVED it, however the temp setting wheel had chipped &amp; cracked, so decided to buy a new curling iron.  </li>
      <li>I have used this brand before and it has been fine.  </li>
      <li>The curling iron works fine...</li>
      <li>It works fine.</li>
      <li>Nice large curling iron.</li>
      <li>My hair is mostly the kind of natural blond which is incredibly fine</li>
      <li>Also, we have ceramic irons and they are nice, but I don&#x27;t really see a huge problem with this type.</li>
      <li>and I am so happy to have it back in my beauty arsenal!</li>
      <li>I bought this curling iron after my cheap Revlon die after 5 years of faithful service.</li>
      <li>Cheap</li>
      <li>I curl up the ends for a perfect finish and this curling iron gives me the big, soft curls that I love.</li>
      <li>This heats up nice and fast</li>
      <li>What I would really like is a 1 3/4&amp;#34; barrel, but nobody makes one that size, so this is the next best thing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line: a good solid product that I like but don&#x27;t love.</li>
      <li>I believe they would be wonderful when I get a hang of it because of my small hands.</li>
      <li>Heats up quickly and if you are looking for natural waves, this product is suitable for you!</li>
      <li>Great product- lots of different heat settings, work exactly as you&#x27;d want a curling iron to work!  </li>
      <li>It came in a good amount of time and even though it ended up being thicker than I expected, it still results in really nice large curls!</li>
      <li>certainly feel much better and save money buying this.</li>
      <li>As i would really like to be able to do it my&lt;br</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t timed the heat up function, but once it is heated, touching the turbo button jumps it up quite fast.</li>
      <li>It feels like a solid, good quality product.  </li>
      <li>It heats up quickly and does the job.</li>
      <li>It heats quickly.  </li>
      <li>I like how it heats up quickly and even has the &#x27;turbo&#x27; button if you need to use it.  </li>
      <li>really really hot!</li>
      <li>I have had this curling iron for a long time, it is great, highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It is really worth the price.</li>
      <li>I like the old finish better.</li>
      <li>Nice big barrel to give my hair some volume.</li>
      <li>so the larger barrel accommodates the length and gives me nice waves.</li>
      <li>It heats up very fast and can heat up very hot.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more slippery when curling hair that already has some product in it, but on totally clean hair, it feels the same when using metal or ceramic-</li>
      <li>,I had one years ago Before the flat irons were really popular .</li>
      <li>the right size and price.</li>
      <li>I have a 1/2&amp;#34; Conair that works great, too, but the diameter is too small.</li>
      <li>It heats fast, but doesn&#x27;t get super hot, even on the highest setting.</li>
      <li>It heats very fast and you can adjust the temperature dial.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I would like.</li>
      <li>I purchased the same one again and like it even better.</li>
      <li>Quite simply this curling iron works 10 times better than the $200.00 CHI curling iron I purchased and returned to QVC.</li>
      <li>I used this the first time on the weekend</li>
      <li>I love how there are so many different heat settings (I personally go for 15 rather than the highest heat).</li>
      <li>I knew I wasn&#x27;t getting a HOT Tools curling iron when I ordered this $13 Conair.</li>
      <li>I have pretty long hair, so the size is great, but the curling potential isn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I bought this one for the larger barrel size, and I love it.</li>
      <li>I have a smaller one for the top of my hair style.</li>
      <li>It heats quickly, love the different heat settings.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a brushed metal finish.</li>
      <li>(don&#x27;t ask me how I know ;) )&lt;</li>
      <li>the turbo heat and its barely hot does nothing at all for my hair.</li>
      <li>It gets really hot and keeps the curl.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s exactly like the one I had in 2007 - threw 2008 .</li>
      <li>They are reliable, quick to heat, and last for a long time, especially given the great price.  </li>
      <li>curley hair and a flat iron is really hard on it , so me buying this , well I&#x27;m going back to the original way I straightened my hair , and this with the temperature settings is the best this for me to use .</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>It really straightens my hair, but my hair has no curls now.</li>
      <li>Heats up really fast.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used curling irons too much before, so am getting used to it.</li>
      <li>you don want to spend so much money on a barrel/wand</li>
      <li>I bought this as a gift for my sister and she said that it did not get very</li>
      <li>/&gt;Highly recommended for gentle curls and waves of the ends of your hair and for smoothing the cuticle from the scalp toward the ends.</li>
      <li>My hair is very layered, so wanted this to do the longer strands.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really get the &#x27;turbo&#x27; thing- doesn&#x27;t seem to heat any faster than my ancient curling iron.</li>
      <li>Both are fast.</li>
      <li>gave it four stars only because it does feel slightly cheap in your hand</li>
      <li>This curler made my really straight hair straighter than before I started curling it.</li>
      <li>I would buy this product again; it is serving me very well.</li>
      <li>It cam e really fast as well.</li>
      <li>I even tried holding it on my hair for 2 minutes straight and still NOTHING.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair straight again the moment you run your fingers through them.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t curl my hair very well but it might just be the texture of my hair.</li>
      <li>I have this iron in 2 sizes and both heat up fast.</li>
      <li>my hair looks so beautiful, the waves are big or small depends</li>
      <li>Its not as shiny as the original but its not flat matte either.  </li>
      <li>Heats up fast and gives my hair the extra va-va-voom for special occasions.  </li>
      <li>easy to curl hair with this, just turn the power button on and 30 seconds later, it&#x27;s hot enough to curl your hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on my 3rd one of this size and brand, but not because they wear out quickly.  </li>
      <li>wide wand gives a smooth and gentle curl to my hair and it also tames the wiry hairs.  </li>
      <li>Heats up super fast and gives big soft curls.</li>
      <li>However, I did expect a little more from this.</li>
      <li>I have long thick hair and it works great.</li>
      <li>Depending on how well I curled it, I can normally sleep and wake up with the curls still intact.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t mind culling normally</li>
      <li>Even more reason for my hair to easily curl, but nit with this useless curling iron.</li>
      <li>The only problem is that I cut my hair right before I got it, and I should have ordered a 1&amp;#34; or a 1 1/4&amp;#34; barrel.</li>
      <li>/&gt;cool touch tip is too short--it is easy to grip a little too far and touch the barrel (did I mention this is really really really hot?)&lt;br /&gt;springs</li>
      <li>Once I was home, I knew I needed to buy a new one.</li>
      <li>Time to find a new brand of curling iron</li>
      <li>This product has a very light weight cord that I have not ever seen on any curling iron or small type appliance before.  </li>
      <li>Smaller barrel irons put in too much curl which falls out quickly leaving my hair poking out at weird angles instead of just laying nicely.</li>
      <li>metal doesnt get sooo hot, i got it bacause I already have a Conair curling iron thats smaller</li>
      <li>as other reviewers have said) is pretty hot to hold on too.</li>
      <li>Even though it&#x27;s cheap in terms of the cost, it&#x27;s still not worth it.</li>
      <li>I got this thinking it would make large curls, but my hair is too long and straight for any curls this iron produces, to stay.  </li>
      <li>I got this for my teenage daughter who needs high heat to curl her straight hair.</li>
      <li>Heats up quick, be careful</li>
      <li>I love the size of the curls, but the heat is not very good, it doesn&#x27;t curl well and does not hold.</li>
      <li>it has serveral temperatures and is large enough.</li>
      <li>This curling iron is identical to my old one, but when I received it &amp; used it, the silver part has some sort of coating on it?  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t remember my old one having that coating..</li>
      <li>just remember, smaller is much easier.</li>
      <li>the temperature control is far to close to the handle causing it to be shut off during use.</li>
      <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s only weakness that I have encountered is that the handle is so much lighter than the curling barrel that the stand does not work, so I will look at curling iron stands.</li>
      <li>I used it to straighten my hair , I have naturally</li>
      <li>I use large hot rollers to sometimes add body to my hair and give it a slight wave.  </li>
      <li>However, the other ones I&#x27;ve owned have been fine, and the one I&#x27;m using now doesn&#x27;t seems to have the power button issues the last one had.</li>
      <li>When the button is pressed, the curling iron turns on and then within a second or two turns right back off, so now I have to buy another one.</li>
      <li>The only negative comment I have is that the &#x27;kickstand&#x27; sometimes gets in my way, but other than that its a great iron for the price.</li>
      <li>it is still better then many of the other expensive brands.</li>
      <li>Curls were minimal and fell right out.</li>
      <li>It has some minor upgrades that I really like.</li>
      <li>My last one lasted me 12 years, using it very frequent.</li>
      <li>I use this large barrel curling iron to smooth and \\&quot;finish\\&quot; my longish shoulder-length hair with a slight underturn so that the ends don&#x27;t look messy.</li>
      <li>I used to travel frequently, and attribute that wear-and-tear to the dying of my earlier irons.&lt;br</li>
      <li>When my old curling iron finally gave up on me, I made the mistake of purchasing the 1 1/4 inch barrel.  </li>
      <li>barely heats up.. and this is a 1.5 inch curler</li>
      <li>This heats up fast and works as expected.  </li>
      <li>The only reason I bought a new one is because the cord stopped swiveling after ten years.</li>
      <li>and really, applying any high heat to your hair excessively will damage it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>During usage, the iron just doesn&#x27;t simply slide down my hair as easily as it did with my previous iron.  </li>
      <li>Pretty much a waste of time.</li>
      <li>Also the cord is not very long and the tip (</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly/ wavy hair that I blow dry out.</li>
      <li>I wonder if there is something wrong with it because it really doesn&#x27;t get very hot.  </li>

<li> really really hot!</li>
<li> I have had this curling iron for a long time, it is great, highly recommend.</li>
<li> It is really worth the price.</li>
<li> I like the old finish better.</li>
<li> Nice big barrel to give my hair some volume.</li>
<li> so the larger barrel accommodates the length and gives me nice waves.</li>
<li> It heats up very fast and can heat up very hot.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s more slippery when curling hair that already has some product in it, but on totally clean hair, it feels the same when using metal or ceramic-</li>
<li> ,I had one years ago Before the flat irons were really popular .</li>
<li> the right size and price.</li>
<li> I have a 1/2&amp;#34; Conair that works great, too, but the diameter is too small.</li>
<li> It heats fast, but doesn&#x27;t get super hot, even on the highest setting.</li>
<li> It heats very fast and you can adjust the temperature dial.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I would like.</li>
<li> I purchased the same one again and like it even better.</li>
<li> Quite simply this curling iron works 10 times better than the $200.00 CHI curling iron I purchased and returned to QVC.</li>
<li> I used this the first time on the weekend</li>
<li> I love how there are so many different heat settings (I personally go for 15 rather than the highest heat).</li>
<li> I knew I wasn&#x27;t getting a HOT Tools curling iron when I ordered this $13 Conair.</li>
<li> I have pretty long hair, so the size is great, but the curling potential isn&#x27;t.</li>
<li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
<li> I bought this one for the larger barrel size, and I love it.</li>
<li> I have a smaller one for the top of my hair style.</li>
<li> It heats quickly, love the different heat settings.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s more of a brushed metal finish.</li>
<li> (don&#x27;t ask me how I know ;) )&lt;</li>
<li> the turbo heat and its barely hot does nothing at all for my hair.</li>
<li> It gets really hot and keeps the curl.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s exactly like the one I had in 2007 - threw 2008 .</li>
<li> They are reliable, quick to heat, and last for a long time, especially given the great price.  </li>
<li> curley hair and a flat iron is really hard on it , so me buying this , well I&#x27;m going back to the original way I straightened my hair , and this with the temperature settings is the best this for me to use .</li>
<li> Fast shipping.</li>
<li> It really straightens my hair, but my hair has no curls now.</li>
<li> Heats up really fast.  </li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t used curling irons too much before, so am getting used to it.</li>
<li> you don want to spend so much money on a barrel/wand</li>
<li> I bought this as a gift for my sister and she said that it did not get very</li>
<li> /&gt;Highly recommended for gentle curls and waves of the ends of your hair and for smoothing the cuticle from the scalp toward the ends.</li>
<li> My hair is very layered, so wanted this to do the longer strands.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t really get the &#x27;turbo&#x27; thing- doesn&#x27;t seem to heat any faster than my ancient curling iron.</li>
<li> Both are fast.</li>
<li> gave it four stars only because it does feel slightly cheap in your hand</li>
<li> This curler made my really straight hair straighter than before I started curling it.</li>
<li> I would buy this product again; it is serving me very well.</li>
<li> It cam e really fast as well.</li>
<li> I even tried holding it on my hair for 2 minutes straight and still NOTHING.</li>
<li> Leaves hair straight again the moment you run your fingers through them.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t curl my hair very well but it might just be the texture of my hair.</li>
<li> I have this iron in 2 sizes and both heat up fast.</li>
<li> my hair looks so beautiful, the waves are big or small depends</li>
<li> Its not as shiny as the original but its not flat matte either.  </li>
<li> Heats up fast and gives my hair the extra va-va-voom for special occasions.  </li>
<li> easy to curl hair with this, just turn the power button on and 30 seconds later, it&#x27;s hot enough to curl your hair.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd one of this size and brand, but not because they wear out quickly.  </li>
<li> wide wand gives a smooth and gentle curl to my hair and it also tames the wiry hairs.  </li>
<li> Heats up super fast and gives big soft curls.</li>
<li> However, I did expect a little more from this.</li>
<li> I have long thick hair and it works great.</li>
<li> Depending on how well I curled it, I can normally sleep and wake up with the curls still intact.</li>
<li> If you don&#x27;t mind culling normally</li>
<li> Even more reason for my hair to easily curl, but nit with this useless curling iron.</li>
<li> The only problem is that I cut my hair right before I got it, and I should have ordered a 1&amp;#34; or a 1 1/4&amp;#34; barrel.</li>
<li> /&gt;cool touch tip is too short--it is easy to grip a little too far and touch the barrel (did I mention this is really really really hot?)&lt;br /&gt;springs</li>
<li> Once I was home, I knew I needed to buy a new one.</li>
<li> Time to find a new brand of curling iron</li>
<li> This product has a very light weight cord that I have not ever seen on any curling iron or small type appliance before.  </li>
<li> Smaller barrel irons put in too much curl which falls out quickly leaving my hair poking out at weird angles instead of just laying nicely.</li>
<li> metal doesnt get sooo hot, i got it bacause I already have a Conair curling iron thats smaller</li>
<li> as other reviewers have said) is pretty hot to hold on too.</li>
<li> Even though it&#x27;s cheap in terms of the cost, it&#x27;s still not worth it.</li>
<li> I got this thinking it would make large curls, but my hair is too long and straight for any curls this iron produces, to stay.  </li>
<li> I got this for my teenage daughter who needs high heat to curl her straight hair.</li>
<li> Heats up quick, be careful</li>
<li> I love the size of the curls, but the heat is not very good, it doesn&#x27;t curl well and does not hold.</li>
<li> it has serveral temperatures and is large enough.</li>
<li> This curling iron is identical to my old one, but when I received it &amp; used it, the silver part has some sort of coating on it?  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t remember my old one having that coating..</li>
<li> just remember, smaller is much easier.</li>
<li> the temperature control is far to close to the handle causing it to be shut off during use.</li>
<li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s only weakness that I have encountered is that the handle is so much lighter than the curling barrel that the stand does not work, so I will look at curling iron stands.</li>
<li> I used it to straighten my hair , I have naturally</li>
<li> I use large hot rollers to sometimes add body to my hair and give it a slight wave.  </li>
<li> However, the other ones I&#x27;ve owned have been fine, and the one I&#x27;m using now doesn&#x27;t seems to have the power button issues the last one had.</li>
<li> When the button is pressed, the curling iron turns on and then within a second or two turns right back off, so now I have to buy another one.</li>
<li> The only negative comment I have is that the &#x27;kickstand&#x27; sometimes gets in my way, but other than that its a great iron for the price.</li>
<li> it is still better then many of the other expensive brands.</li>
<li> Curls were minimal and fell right out.</li>
<li> It has some minor upgrades that I really like.</li>
<li> My last one lasted me 12 years, using it very frequent.</li>
<li> I use this large barrel curling iron to smooth and \\&quot;finish\\&quot; my longish shoulder-length hair with a slight underturn so that the ends don&#x27;t look messy.</li>
<li> I used to travel frequently, and attribute that wear-and-tear to the dying of my earlier irons.&lt;br</li>
<li> When my old curling iron finally gave up on me, I made the mistake of purchasing the 1 1/4 inch barrel.  </li>
<li> barely heats up.. and this is a 1.5 inch curler</li>
<li> This heats up fast and works as expected.  </li>
<li> The only reason I bought a new one is because the cord stopped swiveling after ten years.</li>
<li> and really, applying any high heat to your hair excessively will damage it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> During usage, the iron just doesn&#x27;t simply slide down my hair as easily as it did with my previous iron.  </li>
<li> Pretty much a waste of time.</li>
<li> Also the cord is not very long and the tip (</li>
<li> I have naturally curly/ wavy hair that I blow dry out.</li>
<li> I wonder if there is something wrong with it because it really doesn&#x27;t get very hot.  </li>
<li> it.&lt;br /&gt;settings dial gets changed during normal use--my thumb hits it and turns it down all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I have very straight, hard to curl hair</li>
<li> This curling iron does not get hot enough for medium thick hair.</li>
<li> I should have remembered that large curls just don&#x27;t stay like small ones on my hair type.  </li>
<li> My previous Conair Curling iron was old!  </li>
<li> It gets too hot and is hard to handle without burning myself.</li>
<li> It maybe would curl my ends if I used enough hairspray and held it in the curl for a long time.</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had a curling iron that is so wide, but in the questions section it sounded like people with fine hair that looks thin were repeatedly recommending this</li>
<li> Let&#x27;s just say I looked pretty sad and went to a store immediately afterwards and bought a new one.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
<li> the cord was a little longer but that&#x27;s easily fixed with an extension</li>
<li> (so looks thin even though there are more strands since it weighs itself down), but now that I am in my sixties it also contains some naturally wiry white hairs which give it an appearance of serious damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> so I&#x27;m not surprised to need the turbo heat option to make this iron work for me.  </li>
<li> The burns you will get on your neck or hands from this guy hurt a lot and take a long time to go away.</li>
<li> Curls didn&#x27;t stay in as long as I wanted.</li>
<li> so remember you need LONG hair for this size or else you&#x27;ll just be making circles and not curls.</li>
<li> My hair is long (mid-back length)</li>
<li> as good if not better then the expensive one I previously had.</li>
<li> I use mine on setting 23 of 25 (for my long, thick, fairly coarse hair), and use it at least 5 out of every 7 days, so I&#x27;m excited to get 3-4 years&#x27; use out of my curling irons.  </li>
<li> It works some times and other times it doesn&#x27;t, like there is a short in it.  </li>
<li> Minus another star (down to 2) for a fairly simple product that only lasted 6 months this time.</li>
<li> I think that sas made for very long hair</li>
<li> Gets hot enough to curl even difficult hair.</li>
<li> it is less durable than the last.  </li>
<li> break quickly--my last one lasted less than a year</li>
<li> This is just a little too big for me - I should have bought 1\\&quot; or 1-1/4\\&quot;.  </li>
<li> just really bad quality Feels really cheap!</li>
<li> , I usually wear it the same way; long and in layers.  </li>
<li> Product is as described but doesnt work for my hair which is straight and thin.</li>
<li> I spent 45 minutes trying to get it to hold with no luck.  </li>
<li> works just as expected</li>
<li> But it&#x27;s not what I expected.</li>
<li> I have long, thick hair and anything smaller than the 1 1/2 inch barrel</li>
<li> I like the controls because I don&#x27;t accidently turn it off while styling my hair like other irons I have had.  </li>
<li> Use extreme care when operating and don&#x27;t use this if you aren&#x27;t fully awake.</li>
<li> Compared to other irons, I had to hold the iron in longer.</li>
<li> I bought the 1-1/4 inch at the local store and it was too small - they didn&#x27;t have this size</li>
<li> The items is difficult to manipulate and does not provide the large spiral waves</li>
<li> I have long hair past my shoulders that holds a curl.  </li>
<li> but i returned this because it doesnt heat up enough for my thick hair</li>
<li> I have to hold the clamp down to slide my hair through.</li>
<li> so you don&#x27;t burn down your house if you forget to turn it off in the morning&lt;br</li>
<li> I would have given this 3 and a half stars if there was an option for that.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this curling iron less than 5 times.</li>
<li> and I ordered Conair curling irons late July 2010, early April 2011, and late May 2012.</li>
<li> This shapes the hair slightly and smooths it without looking too \\&quot;coiffed\\&quot;.</li>
<li> Not even a SLIGHT curl.</li>
<li> 1 inch gives me too tight if curls.</li>
<li> The wire stand is a little annoying, but is pretty typical so not really a big deal.  </li>
<li> The waves come out a little looser than I want them to, but maybe I should have gone with the 1&amp;#34</li>
<li> Yesterday I clicked desperately for 15 minutes trying to get ready for church.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a disabled person and have to have someone else do my hair for me.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> Update 1/23/2013:  ...and now this one is dead.</li>
<li> Just a very slight wave.  </li>
<li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY !</li>
<li> and I tried a small piece of my hair.</li>
<li> I hate that I can only find this size on Amazon though; I don&#x27;t know why my local stores don&#x27;t carry the 1 1/2&amp;#34;</li>
<li> This was a gift for my sister and have yet to receive a complaint,  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t do anything crazy or different with my hair</li>
<li> /&gt;Short of nuclear fusion or crazy chemistry, not much will curl my super-straight hair.</li>
<li> Still, in need of a curling iron, I used it but was not happy with the results.  </li>
<li> I decided to ignore the other reviews thinking it couldn&#x27;t be as bad as what people said.</li>
<li> , I find it disturbing that some helpers have no idea how to use this.  </li>
<li> One fall off my 28 inch vanity counter and the tip broke in a million pieces making it useless.</li>
<li> A very poorly designed curling iron.</li>
<li> but I&#x27;m so angry !</li>
<li> Worst curling iron ever.</li>
<li> Terrible terrible terrible! !!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I would like.</li>
    <li> This curling iron works well and my daughter loved it! She&#x27;s uses it daily!</li>
    <li> I recently lost my conair curling iron on vacation. Once I was home, I knew I needed to buy a new one. I found the same model that I had on Amazon. I bought it for a great price and I am so happy to have it back in my beauty arsenal! My last iron lasted for years and worked so well.</li>
    <li> I bought this curling iron to replace my last Conair curling iron that broke. It heats up quickly and does the job.</li>
    <li> I have used this brand before and it has been fine.  I wonder if there is something wrong with it because it really doesn&#x27;t get very hot.  If I had bought this in a store, I would have returned it.  (And I am not that picky).</li>
    <li> Product is as described but doesnt work for my hair which is straight and thin. I prefer 1 inch and 3/4 inch iron better for me,</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Fast shipping. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Sucked, didn&#x27;t keep the curls in 👎</li>
    <li> I dont know how to &amp;#34;work it&amp;#34;!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for the same model/brand.  Very happy.</li>
    <li> This product has a very light weight cord that I have not ever seen on any curling iron or small type appliance before.  I tossed the package it came in or I would send it back.  It works some times and other times it doesn&#x27;t, like there is a short in it.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This product has a heat setting so you can set the desired temperature. The design of the handle makes this easy to use. And the metal part doesn&#x27;t burn your  hair but straightens and curls just so. I absolutely love it and have no intentions of converting to a ceramic. This does the same thing so why pay so much more for a ceramic?</li>
    <li> I had one of these that I used for years before the spring in the handle broke. I purchased the same one again and like it even better. It has some minor upgrades that I really like.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a disabled person and have to have someone else do my hair for me. As i would really like to be able to do it my&lt;br /&gt;self, I find it disturbing that some helpers have no idea how to use this.  So que sera,sera. What can I do,but hope someone will know.</li>
    <li> My previous Conair Curling iron was old!  LOVED it, however the temp setting wheel had chipped &amp; cracked, so decided to buy a new curling iron.  This curling iron is identical to my old one, but when I received it &amp; used it, the silver part has some sort of coating on it?  Maybe that&#x27;ll wear off in time?  During usage, the iron just doesn&#x27;t simply slide down my hair as easily as it did with my previous iron.  I don&#x27;t remember my old one having that coating..but then again, it was broke in.  The curling iron works fine...maybe its just an adjustment, breaking in period?  I dunno...anyway, it does what its supposed to do.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product. I have long thick hair and it works great. Of course its not a one time deal, a couple of times and u get a nice hair style</li>
    <li> Good easy to use but hair did not stay in curls all day</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through several of these over the years. My last one had problems with the power button (sometimes it would work, sometimes it wouldn&#x27;t), and it finally crapped out after about a year. However, the other ones I&#x27;ve owned have been fine, and the one I&#x27;m using now doesn&#x27;t seems to have the power button issues the last one had. I hate that I can only find this size on Amazon though; I don&#x27;t know why my local stores don&#x27;t carry the 1 1/2&amp;#34; size. What I would really like is a 1 3/4&amp;#34; barrel, but nobody makes one that size, so this is the next best thing.</li>
    <li> No amount of product or application time produced a curl with this iron.  I spent 45 minutes trying to get it to hold with no luck.  Curls were minimal and fell right out. Returned it.</li>
    <li> I like the turbo power on when I&#x27;m in a rush. I believe they would be wonderful when I get a hang of it because of my small hands. Other than that they work wonderful.</li>
    <li> This is just a little too big for me - I should have bought 1\\&quot; or 1-1/4\\&quot;.  It really straightens my hair, but my hair has no curls now. It just makes my hair look like its been ironed.  That&#x27;s the style these days, I guess.  However, it says the cord doesn&#x27;t tangle, but it does.</li>
    <li> Quite simply this curling iron works 10 times better than the $200.00 CHI curling iron I purchased and returned to QVC.</li>
    <li> Love my curling iron. Heats up really fast.  Great quality for the price!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ll use it sometimes but 1/2 inch mini irons are much better than this one. just remember, smaller is much easier.</li>
    <li> I like that this is for body more than curl. I haven&#x27;t used curling irons too much before, so am getting used to it. it seems like it will work well.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is great. I used it overseas and it worked perfectly with the dual voltage. Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I used this the first time on the weekend and I am so happy. It is really worth the price. I got lots of complements about how I looked.&lt;br /&gt;I certainly feel much better and save money buying this.</li>
    <li> The cord on the curling iron is ridiculously short!!!!  Makes it such a pain to use.  You may want to think of the layout of your bathroom before buying!</li>
    <li> Works well! I love how there are so many different heat settings (I personally go for 15 rather than the highest heat). It came in a good amount of time and even though it ended up being thicker than I expected, it still results in really nice large curls! Depending on how well I curled it, I can normally sleep and wake up with the curls still intact.</li>
    <li> It works great, and the price was reasonable. The only problem is that I cut my hair right before I got it, and I should have ordered a 1&amp;#34; or a 1 1/4&amp;#34; barrel. I have a 1/2&amp;#34; Conair that works great, too, but the diameter is too small. Make sure you order the right diameter barrel, and you will be pleased with the quality and price.</li>
    <li> I knew I wasn&#x27;t getting a HOT Tools curling iron when I ordered this $13 Conair. However, I did expect a little more from this. It heats fast, but doesn&#x27;t get super hot, even on the highest setting. I have pretty long hair, so the size is great, but the curling potential isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Great curling iron!  It heats up very fast and can heat up very hot.  You can&#x27;t beat it for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Wish the cord was a little longer but that&#x27;s easily fixed with an extension cord.&lt;br /&gt;Just as good if not better then the expensive one I previously had.</li>
    <li> It gets too hot and is hard to handle without burning myself. It will go out for a garage sale.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the 1 inch curling iron for over 4 years and it&#x27;s still holding up. I actually removed the clamp and I love more than I did before.</li>
    <li> I have always bought Conair curling irons.  They are reliable, quick to heat, and last for a long time, especially given the great price.  I am giving this three stars because it doesn&#x27;t glide through hair as easily as their others.  It is a great curling iron, however, so if you don&#x27;t need the gliding motion, you&#x27;re all set.</li>
    <li> I personally unscrewed the clip and just used the barrel itself as a wand and it works perfectly. I love how the curls look and I f you don want to spend so much money on a barrel/wand just buy this and unscrew the clip. If you don&#x27;t mind culling normally the regardless it is still better then many of the other expensive brands.</li>
    <li> LOVE this curling iron. Have used this one for years, but they don&#x27;t sell the 1 1/2&amp;#34; in stores anymore, from what I&#x27;ve found. Love the auto-shut-off and sturdy construction. Gets hot enough to curl even difficult hair.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Works great and is very affordable. Conair is my favorite curling iron band. My last one lasted me 12 years, using it very frequent.</li>
    <li> metal doesnt get sooo hot, i got it bacause I already have a Conair curling iron thats smaller that i love and its been working for years&lt;br /&gt;so i was expecting this one to work the same but it doesnt.</li>
    <li> I had to return this product. I bought this as a gift for my sister and she said that it did not get very hot.&lt;br /&gt;She could not even put curls in her hair.</li>
    <li> it is great and works perfectly</li>
    <li> I have always used the. Conakry curling irons. I bought this one for the larger barrel size, and I love it. I don&#x27;t think you should have to pay a lot for a curling iron thrower forms well. This one is no exception. The curls turn out great, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a 1 1/2 in curling iron.</li>
    <li> Nice large curling iron. It heats very fast and you can adjust the temperature dial. Happy with the results and purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too big. I think that sas made for very long hair</li>
    <li> I got this thinking it would make large curls, but my hair is too long and straight for any curls this iron produces, to stay.  I should have remembered that large curls just don&#x27;t stay like small ones on my hair type.  BUT I got something even better that I wasn&#x27;t expecting.... I use large hot rollers to sometimes add body to my hair and give it a slight wave.  That is what this curler does for me now.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Have I mentioned how much I love this curling iron?!?  I&#x27;m on my 3rd one of this size and brand, but not because they wear out quickly.  I use mine on setting 23 of 25 (for my long, thick, fairly coarse hair), and use it at least 5 out of every 7 days, so I&#x27;m excited to get 3-4 years&#x27; use out of my curling irons.  I used to travel frequently, and attribute that wear-and-tear to the dying of my earlier irons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for gentle curls and waves of the ends of your hair and for smoothing the cuticle from the scalp toward the ends.</li>
    <li> I have very straight, hard to curl hair so I&#x27;m not surprised to need the turbo heat option to make this iron work for me.  It does a pretty good job.  It heats quickly.  I like the controls because I don&#x27;t accidently turn it off while styling my hair like other irons I have had.  The wire stand is a little annoying, but is pretty typical so not really a big deal.  I would have given this 3 and a half stars if there was an option for that.</li>
    <li> I like it, but wish the stand wasn&#x27;t metal - I almost burn myself every time ha!</li>
    <li> Heats up very fast and makes wonderful shiny curls! works just as expected</li>
    <li> For the price it&#x27;s terrific! Heats up super fast and gives big soft curls. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with it&#x27;s performance.</li>
    <li> I bought the biggest size of this curling just great but I want to say that works well with med_long hair as my hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is very layered, so wanted this to do the longer strands. I have a smaller one for the top of my hair style. It heats quickly, love the different heat settings. Feels very comfortable in my arthritic hands.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good for a curling iron that is so cheap. I bought this so I could make my hair wavy. The waves come out a little looser than I want them to, but maybe I should have gone with the 1&amp;#34; iron. Regardless, it&#x27;s a very good curling iron.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this curling iron less than 5 times. This last time I was using it, it was on and working, I went to pick it up and it cut out and has yet to work again. Not to mention the item was not even packaged. Just thrown into a plastic bag and shipped to me.</li>
    <li> The only negative comment I have is that the &#x27;kickstand&#x27; sometimes gets in my way, but other than that its a great iron for the price.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. One fall off my 28 inch vanity counter and the tip broke in a million pieces making it useless. I&#x27;m a week beyond the refund deadline. Ugh!</li>
    <li> I love Conair curling irons. I&#x27;ve been using them for about 20yrs. I&#x27;m a big fan of the chrome finish. It lets my hair slide through without tugging on it. This isn&#x27;t the shiny barrel I&#x27;m used to it. It&#x27;s more of a brushed metal finish. I have to hold the clamp down to slide my hair through. It&#x27;s not the end of the world. But it&#x27;s not what I expected. I like the old finish better.</li>
    <li> I got this for my teenage daughter who needs high heat to curl her straight hair. It works fine. I don&#x27;t really get the &#x27;turbo&#x27; thing- doesn&#x27;t seem to heat any faster than my ancient curling iron. Both are fast. Also, we have ceramic irons and they are nice, but I don&#x27;t really see a huge problem with this type. I lived through the 80&#x27;s using a metal barrel (and vats of hair product) and I don&#x27;t think my hair has changed at all after now using ceramic since they came out. It&#x27;s more slippery when curling hair that already has some product in it, but on totally clean hair, it feels the same when using metal or ceramic- and really, applying any high heat to your hair excessively will damage it.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars only because it does feel slightly cheap in your hand and I wish the handle were thicker, but for this price, it&#x27;s a really nice iron!</li>
    <li> I have this in a smaller version and I could not find this size barrel anywhere. Very nicely made and hold hair in tightly for great curls without burning.</li>
    <li> the temperature control is far to close to the handle causing it to be shut off during use. A very poorly designed curling iron.</li>
    <li> I love the size of the curls, but the heat is not very good, it doesn&#x27;t curl well and does not hold.</li>
    <li> I bought this curling iron after my cheap Revlon die after 5 years of faithful service. I read the reviews and they basically looked good and the price was reasonable.  And it worked for three months.  But I began noticing the click button took more and more attempts to get it \\&quot;on\\&quot;.  Yesterday I clicked desperately for 15 minutes trying to get ready for church.  Let&#x27;s just say I looked pretty sad and went to a store immediately afterwards and bought a new one.&lt;br /&gt;Also, while it still worked, the rest metal bar seemed to always be at odds with either my hand or my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, you could do better.  Keep looking.</li>
    <li> I decided to ignore the other reviews thinking it couldn&#x27;t be as bad as what people said. This curler made my really straight hair straighter than before I started curling it. It maybe would curl my ends if I used enough hairspray and held it in the curl for a long time. Also the cord is not very long and the tip (as other reviewers have said) is pretty hot to hold on too. Do not purchase</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to keep a curl but it works well</li>
    <li> Great price shipment came fast. Hot and curls my hair great. the right size and price. will purchas again when needed.</li>
    <li> Great product- lots of different heat settings, work exactly as you&#x27;d want a curling iron to work!  Cheap price- AND great product- don&#x27;t find that too often!</li>
    <li> Update 1/23/2013:  ...and now this one is dead. Minus another star (down to 2) for a fairly simple product that only lasted 6 months this time. It&#x27;s been acting up for about a month now, and today finally gave up the ghost. When the button is pressed, the curling iron turns on and then within a second or two turns right back off, so now I have to buy another one. It seems like each time I buy a Conair product it is less durable than the last.  Hopefully my hair dryer will hold it together for longer than this thing did.  I checked my Amazon order history and I ordered Conair curling irons late July 2010, early April 2011, and late May 2012. Time to find a new brand of curling iron, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review from August 2012:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short of nuclear fusion or crazy chemistry, not much will curl my super-straight hair. I use this large barrel curling iron to smooth and \\&quot;finish\\&quot; my longish shoulder-length hair with a slight underturn so that the ends don&#x27;t look messy. Smaller barrel irons put in too much curl which falls out quickly leaving my hair poking out at weird angles instead of just laying nicely. This shapes the hair slightly and smooths it without looking too \\&quot;coiffed\\&quot;. I haven&#x27;t timed the heat up function, but once it is heated, touching the turbo button jumps it up quite fast. Use extreme care when operating and don&#x27;t use this if you aren&#x27;t fully awake. The burns you will get on your neck or hands from this guy hurt a lot and take a long time to go away. (don&#x27;t ask me how I know ;) )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros and Cons:&lt;br /&gt;pros:&lt;br /&gt;barrel size works for my purposes&lt;br /&gt;price is right&lt;br /&gt;gets really really hot! especially with the turbo setting&lt;br /&gt;auto-off so you don&#x27;t burn down your house if you forget to turn it off in the morning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;metal barrel instead of a gentler material&lt;br /&gt;cool touch tip is too short--it is easy to grip a little too far and touch the barrel (did I mention this is really really really hot?)&lt;br /&gt;springs break quickly--my last one lasted less than a year so I had to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;settings dial gets changed during normal use--my thumb hits it and turns it down all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: a good solid product that I like but don&#x27;t love.</li>
    <li> Wish it would get hotter. Curls didn&#x27;t stay in as long as I wanted. Compared to other irons, I had to hold the iron in longer.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my sister and have yet to receive a complaint,  so I think it&#x27;s safe to say she&#x27;s happy with it.</li>
    <li> This curling iron lasted me ten years and going.  The only reason I bought a new one is because the cord stopped swiveling after ten years.</li>
    <li> I had another one like this for many years.  I like how it heats up quickly and even has the &#x27;turbo&#x27; button if you need to use it.  I would buy this product again; it is serving me very well.</li>
    <li> Worst curling iron ever. Doesn&#x27;t  heat up at all i have it  on the highest setting  plus the turbo heat and its barely hot does nothing at all for my hair. I would return it  but i took the clamp off which i do with most of my curling irons because its just easier to use as a wand. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ! I know its only $13 but I&#x27;m so angry ! Terrible terrible terrible! !!</li>
    <li> A very effective inexpensive product. My wife&#x27;s hair looks great!</li>
    <li> The items is difficult to manipulate and does not provide the large spiral waves/curls it promises. I should return the thing.</li>
    <li> This was too big for my hair. Pretty much a waste of time. Just a very slight wave.  The curling iron seems good, it&#x27;s the size of the barrel. I have long hair past my shoulders that holds a curl.  1 inch gives me too tight if curls. Trying 1 1 /4 next.</li>
    <li> Expect waves or big curls! Good deal!</li>
    <li> My friend loves. I love it and I have one in almost every size (I have 4 sisters, friends that come stay, or for weddings etc.) and this one is the best.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand and style curling iron for years.  When my old curling iron finally gave up on me, I made the mistake of purchasing the 1 1/4 inch barrel.  Still, in need of a curling iron, I used it but was not happy with the results.  I ordered the 1 1/2 inch and I&#x27;ve had happy hair ever since :)  I have long, thick hair and anything smaller than the 1 1/2 inch barrel just doesn&#x27;t work.  I don&#x27;t do anything crazy or different with my hair, I usually wear it the same way; long and in layers.  I curl up the ends for a perfect finish and this curling iron gives me the big, soft curls that I love.</li>
    <li> Its not as shiny as the original but its not flat matte either.  I wish they would make the barrel like they used too.</li>
    <li> This is perfect. It gets really hot and keeps the curl. It cam e really fast as well. I would say get one</li>
    <li> barely heats up.. and this is a 1.5 inch curler so remember you need LONG hair for this size or else you&#x27;ll just be making circles and not curls. but i returned this because it doesnt heat up enough for my thick hair</li>
    <li> Works well without overheating. Shuts off if I forget to turn it off. Good size for traveling. Took this curling iron to Berlin, Germany, and worked well with an adapter for Germany.</li>
    <li> I have had this curling iron for a long time, it is great, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> easy to curl hair with this, just turn the power button on and 30 seconds later, it&#x27;s hot enough to curl your hair.  great for mornings when you don&#x27;t have time to wait for your curlers to heat up.</li>
    <li> wonderful replacement for my old one</li>
    <li> Amazing! Heats up quick, be careful</li>
    <li> Is this a joke?? I have it turned to the highest setting AND the turbo max on (turbo max is supposed to get it hotter) and I tried a small piece of my hair. NOTHING. Not even a SLIGHT curl. I even tried holding it on my hair for 2 minutes straight and still NOTHING. What the hell??? I have naturally curly/ wavy hair that I blow dry out. Even more reason for my hair to easily curl, but nit with this useless curling iron. I&#x27;m returning this junk tomorrow.</li>
    <li> This heats up nice and fast and I like the adjustable heat settings.  Nice big barrel to give my hair some volume.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast and gives my hair the extra va-va-voom for special occasions.  My hair is long (mid-back length) so the larger barrel accommodates the length and gives me nice waves.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work well at all. Leaves hair straight again the moment you run your fingers through them. Even though it&#x27;s cheap in terms of the cost, it&#x27;s still not worth it.</li>
    <li> My hair is mostly the kind of natural blond which is incredibly fine (so looks thin even though there are more strands since it weighs itself down), but now that I am in my sixties it also contains some naturally wiry white hairs which give it an appearance of serious damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had a curling iron that is so wide, but in the questions section it sounded like people with fine hair that looks thin were repeatedly recommending this iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wide wand gives a smooth and gentle curl to my hair and it also tames the wiry hairs.  Result:  on seeing how it looked my husband exclaimed, &amp;#34;Wow!  Your hair has not looked that good in years!&amp;#34;  He is right.  The result is great and the use is easy, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s only weakness that I have encountered is that the handle is so much lighter than the curling barrel that the stand does not work, so I will look at curling iron stands.</li>
    <li> Instant Heat Curling Iron, 1 1/2-Inch it work</li>
    <li> Conair used  to make good stuff and now the metal ..... just really bad quality Feels really cheap!</li>
    <li> Love love love this product...</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t curl my hair very well but it might just be the texture of my hair.</li>
    <li> This curling iron does not get hot enough for medium thick hair.</li>
    <li> Gets nice and hot, does so fairly quickly, and it is nice and easy to use.  It feels like a solid, good quality product.  No complaints!</li>
    <li> Purchased as a replacement for my curling iron that bit the dust.  This heats up fast and works as expected.  Still getting used to the smaller handle, but overall I like it</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly and if you are looking for natural waves, this product is suitable for you!</li>
    <li> The curler didn&#x27;t work well for me</li>
    <li> Works great. I have this iron in 2 sizes and both heat up fast. Easy to use and leaves my hair with shiny curls.</li>
    <li> works really good!! I recommend this.</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron. I bought the 1-1/4 inch at the local store and it was too small - they didn&#x27;t have this size so I ordered this 1-1/2 inch. It makes my hair perfect, and it heats up in a matter of seconds.</li>
    <li> I love this produ t. It curls my hair very good i would recommend this product to everyone. I started to get a more expensive curling iron but im glad i got this one. thank u stehanie floyd</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good curling iron and it does its job but it&#x27;s definitely lower quality.</li>
    <li> I love this ,I had one years ago Before the flat irons were really popular . I used it to straighten my hair , I have naturally curley hair and a flat iron is really hard on it , so me buying this , well I&#x27;m going back to the original way I straightened my hair , and this with the temperature settings is the best this for me to use . I&#x27;m so glad they still make them ! it&#x27;s exactly like the one I had in 2007 - threw 2008 .</li>
    <li> my hair looks so beautiful, the waves are big or small depends how many you turn it. it has serveral temperatures and is large enough. i love it</li>
