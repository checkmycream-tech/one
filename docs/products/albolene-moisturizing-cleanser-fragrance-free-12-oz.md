<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product has cleared up my skin. The red bloches are starting to disapear and has made my skin softer. Any new breakouts or bloches disapear quickly. I recommend to anyone that has red or brown marks and would like smoother skin.</li>
    <li> This is incredible stuff...works well, keeps your skin soft and supple, yet doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My last jar lasted 3 years. Removes mascara perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously good stuff!&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t find it any more where I live. Sad</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace Ponds - what I had been using all my life.  I wanted to buy something that was not tested on animals - this works great - as well as ponds to remove makeup, and my skin likes it</li>
    <li> Great product. I recommend it. I use it under plastic wrap while exercising.</li>
    <li> Slick &amp; great for it&#x27;s intended use.  The best I&#x27;ve used --- and I&#x27;ve used A LOT - and I mean A LOT!!!</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and have purchased the expensive skin products for years to help moisturize the skin on my face.  I am getting older (mid-50s) and felt like nothing was really working.  My doctor recommended this.  I now use this product on my face and all over my body.  It is not a miracle worker so I would not say I look younger.  However, my skin feels better and is better moisturized for a VERY reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this wasn&#x27;t made to wash off with water, that you are supposed to wipe it off with a tissue or something. I don&#x27;t like the residue it leaves behind, I think caused by the petrolatum and paraffin. I was looking for a makeup remover/face wash, but I would only want to use this for eye makeup or something like that. I&#x27;m going to keep it around for a while and see if I can get used to it, but I already bought something else that I can wash off with water in the shower.</li>
    <li> I only use Albolene for my personal pleasuring needs.  It never dries out and never needs to be re-applied.  The makers of Albolene are truly a man&#x27;s best friend!</li>
    <li> I will use it again.  It reminds me of petroleum jelly, I am not comparing the two.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Albolene since I was 18.  A dermatologist recommended it. I have a skin condition that gets worse when regular soaps are used.  Decades later, I&#x27;m still using it.  It cleans and moisturizes and I would use nothing else.  Gets off stubborn mascara.  It sort of liquefies on contact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most soaps can be very drying and harsh, especially for sensitive skin.  Stay away from them.  Get some Albolene.  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I have been using Albolene Unscented Cleanser for over 40 years (yes, that&#x27;s right!) and I swear by this product. While I am not obsessed with looking young, I am 65 years old and throughout my entire adult life, most people have thought I am ten years younger because my skin is so smooth, clear and unwrinkled. I actually have no crow&#x27;s feet around my eyes. I use this product every night before I wash my face (with Dove unscented soap, which I also swear by). I have never used any anti-wrinkle cream or had any dermatological or surgical procedures, and so it must be the Albolene (and Dove soap) doing the great job!</li>
    <li> Great  stuff - inexpensive but equal to cleansers found in the high-end cosmetic counters.</li>
    <li> A great product for cleansing and removing make up.  All that it was described to be.  A magnificent moisturizer with lubricating characteristic.  Quality made.</li>
    <li> Good product when using with a sweatbelt when working out...you should see how much perspiration just falls off my tummy*,*</li>
    <li> She needed it for makeup remover and what ever else Her &amp; Her Husband choose to use it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not saying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what this supposed to do but it does remove your makeup and it definately does make your skin soft, i think i&#x27;m in love with Albolene, and will be ordering this item again.</li>
    <li> It makes a clean sweep of all makeup then I remove it with soap and/0r toner as it is greasy.  Abilene has been around forever &amp; tho not exciting, it &amp;#34;gets the dirt out&amp;#34;. Elaine.  NC</li>
    <li> Excellent product for makeup removal.  I also use it as a facial moisturizer.  Shipped fast.</li>
    <li> My mom has been using this product for over 30 years.  At 66 years old, she gets told she looks 10 years younger.  Her secret is Albolene.  I have been using it for about a month, and at 36 years old, my skin is the smoothest it has been since before high school.  I follow up with wipes such as L&#x27;Oreal ReviaLift in the evening.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have been on this earth for 28 years and I did not know about this product. 28 years LOST. I will now refer to those years as \\&quot;The Dark Age.\\&quot; This stuff has absolutely changed my life! I have determined that, boy or girl, I will name my first-born Albolene and will recommend this to anyone who will listen! My family, my friends, my co-workers, my neighbors, your neighbors, complete strangers. I&#x27;ll shout it from the street corners and the rooftops! I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s definitely worth the price, moreso even. I look so much healthier and feel better about myself. This  product cured my depression and makes my confidence soar to infinity and beyond. I am a new woman!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Albolene. I love you more than cereal.</li>
    <li> I use this with plastic wrap and a waist trainer and I have seen a difference after my workouts in my stomach covered in sweat and inches off.</li>
    <li> This product sucks!!dont buy it.  you will be let down. Its a greases mess that will not come off and you will feel sticky for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poor Poor Product!!</li>
    <li> Great to dissolve makeup, particularly eye makeup.  It does however leave a residue of oil on the skin, requiring for me, an additionally deep cleansing gel and witch hazel toner.  You can use it on other parts of your body to smooth and moisturize very dry skin but is oily and if you put too much on, you can stain your clothing or sheets.  Just too oily but it has its purposes.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my mother, after she had surgery. The doctor told her it was good for her scars. She loves it.</li>
    <li> To greasy when it goes on, but disappears quickly!</li>
    <li> i forgot i even bought this. i bought it as a fragrance free alternative to ponds cold cream to remove my eye makeup. does not cause irritation but to be honest i prefer pure vaseline and a baby wipe to remove eye makeup. its the best. this is more runny. its useable though and i will use it. eventually.</li>
    <li> THANK YOU I USW IT WHEN I WORK OUT, WHICH I&#x27;LL BE USING SOON. THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> Gentlemen, if you are looking for something to help your hand action during your alone time, this is the product!  I&#x27;m totally hooked.</li>
    <li> Great for mature skin.  Takes makeup of very quickly and leaves softer skin behind. Sometimes the simplest things work best.</li>
    <li> Product did remove eye and face makeup as expected,  but it was difficult to rinse off; residue irritated my eyes.</li>
