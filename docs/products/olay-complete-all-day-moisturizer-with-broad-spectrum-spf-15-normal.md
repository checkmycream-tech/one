      <li>I will probably switch to something a little heavier in the winter, but this is great for summer.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for everyday use.  </li>
      <li>I use this lotion everyday for my face - it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to cause breakouts and is useful to provide some sun protection.</li>
      <li>A better choice would be Coppertone Sensitive Skin.  </li>
      <li>So nice to only have to use one product to accomplish two things.  </li>
      <li>I love Olay Complete.  </li>
      <li>, I rarely wear any make up.</li>
      <li>Achieves a fresh, hydrated look.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Olay Complete all day moisturizer for many years now.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice basic moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>its the only kind i can use that wont break me out with repeated use.</li>
      <li>also think my skin is pretty soft since I&#x27;ve been using this, and I have not had any additional or unusual breakouts (the package says it is non-comedogenic), so that&#x27;s nice, as well.</li>
      <li>and the price is right.</li>
      <li>Within a minute of putting it on I can put my make up right over it.</li>
      <li>It goes right into my face and doesn&#x27;t feel like I have anything on at all.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s just the right size to get through airport security.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit of an art to getting the right amount.</li>
      <li>So light and high quality.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a good daily moisturizer with some SPF protection for her mature skin, and this was the right balance of price and quality.</li>
      <li>Love because no matter how much I use I never break out as with so many other moisturizers.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin that irritates easily</li>
      <li>At any rate, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this moisturizer.itional or unusual breakouts (the package says it is non-comedogenic), so that&#x27;s nice, as well.</li>
      <li>Great every day facial lotion, especially since it contains SPF 15.  </li>
      <li>My face is more oily to combination and this is one of the few moisturizers that does not make my face more oily.</li>
      <li>Pro it smells very nice and not like the usual gag inducing smell of most low price sunscreens.</li>
      <li>it does a great job of moisturizing my face for all day long, plus its also has a sunblock in it, which is so important and why i choose this over other moiturizers.</li>
      <li>Thanks Olay!</li>
      <li>I found better costs and now feel back in condition.</li>
      <li>I guess this is one of those rare cases when I really can&#x27;t think of anything I don&#x27;t like about the product.</li>
      <li>I guess this is one of those rare cases when I really can&#x27;t think of anything I don&#x27;t like about the product.</li>
      <li>This is the first time that I&#x27;ve tried the product with sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>All Day Moisturizer feels on my face at first.  </li>
      <li>That was my first review.   </li>
      <li>I also love that it has SPF 15, which we should all use daily.</li>
      <li>This is my first moisturizer with sunscreen (shame on me)</li>
      <li>Still found myself getting darker, but I&#x27;m finally learning more about SPF.</li>
      <li>Bought this for my mother while Amazon was offering coupons on different Olay products, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>It works very well under makeup too!</li>
      <li>My face was soft and glowing,no scent, light, no grease, and soothing.</li>
      <li>It also acts as a great base for makeup and helps my foundation go on smooth and silky and gives me a nice dewy finish.</li>
      <li>Would have been even better if I could get it for the same price but not add on.</li>
      <li>Obviously I would add a heavier sunblock for a more outdoorsy day though.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
      <li>This is my favorite face moisturizer and I would recommend it for daily use.</li>
      <li>I would not recommend it though unless you are willing to take the risk of buying a product that has to be used in a hurry before it expires.</li>
      <li>even teen years,,,,the better off her skin will be.  </li>
      <li>Oh and even though it does say all day, that means every three to four hours reapplying if you&#x27;re outside most of the time period.</li>
      <li>Will be buying more of this in the future.</li>
      <li>It makes my face feel so soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Also, not  expensive and works.</li>
      <li>I like it, but I wish the sunscreen was a higher spf.</li>
      <li>My mum only use olay for so many years.</li>
      <li>wish the spf were higher.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s economical, goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and actually helps prevent breakouts by moisturizing just the right amount.</li>
      <li>It feels nice on my skin and doesn&#x27;t have that overpowering scent that other sunblocks have.</li>
      <li>My face is just so clean and clear when I get home after being in the sun</li>
      <li>My skin has gotten more sensitive over the years, getting very red and/or irritated easily, and I am having no reaction whatsoever to the Sensitive Olay.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very picky about moisturizers and this is one is exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>Now I don&#x27;t blame the whole product line or brand only because it&#x27;s probably from the zinc oxide which is a natural sun protection barrier good for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly, isn&#x27;t greasy and offers protection from sun exposure.  </li>
      <li>My skin is super sensitive .</li>
      <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Second it&#x27;s magic in a bottle because I have VERY sensitive skin and not every lotion for my skin works .</li>
      <li>At first I used it on my face and neck, but as I got older, I needed a creamier moisturizer for my face as my skin became drier.</li>
      <li>It is an amazing little moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I have recently given up on this one and found another product to use - organic - because the chemical list on this seems huge.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light enough</li>
      <li>love any olay products...always as expected</li>
      <li>i bought this expecting too much.</li>
      <li>My tip is to use it a s a night and day cream after gentle washing and exfoliaiting the face.</li>
      <li>You really will see a plumpness and radiance to your face in this space of time.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t moisturize very well but protects under the sun</li>
      <li>This face cream really agrees with me.  </li>
      <li>I really recommend it, for every age and skin type.</li>
      <li>My face felt really refreshed.........  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really worked  out well.  </li>
      <li>After much research i purchased this product and I have no regrets.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing though.</li>
      <li>It is light and not oily and you will appreciate the SPF of 15 decades later.  </li>
      <li>My grandmother swears by Olay, and I really can&#x27;t blame her.</li>
      <li>so can&#x27;t comment too much about it, but</li>
      <li>gentle on skin.  </li>
      <li>and this does not irritate my skin but can sometimes make my face oily if I apply too much.</li>
      <li>but it dries up really fast when you put it on your face.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This really helped add moisture to my skin.</li>
      <li>and I usually only have to apply it once a day to keep my skin smooth and supple.</li>
      <li>I have been using Olay my whole life.</li>
      <li>It actually protect me from sun light as ot states</li>
      <li>and this works really well for me.  </li>
      <li>My face itched and burned so much</li>
      <li>I really enjoy this product and when fall comes around again, I will definitely be getting another bottle of it.</li>
      <li>highly recommend !</li>
      <li>and she wouldn&#x27;t sit real close to me out  side.  </li>
      <li>Does really well for my skin.</li>
      <li>Since I don&#x27;t wear makeup, this was too much hassle for me.  </li>
      <li>It is light which I need in a daily cream.</li>
      <li>I really like the ways this lotion feels on my face.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery</li>
      <li>This stuff burns my eye fast.</li>
      <li>This is very greasy and also made me break out.</li>
      <li>I should have never made the switch because she really prefers Aveeno.</li>
      <li>and this is the only moisturizer with sunscreen I&#x27;ve been able to find (besides my old product which started burning) that doesn&#x27;t burn my skin and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy on my face.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It comes out in a very liquidy form, much more watery than other moisturizers.</li>
      <li>The consistency and aroma is different from the original product, but it seems to work as well and it has the added benefit of sunscreen protection.</li>
      <li>I have some other stuff,its lighter and ok for summer.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many other costly sunscreen products, and found them all to be rather sticky.  </li>
      <li>I love the mild SPF 15, I have been wearing it in all the sun we have been getting lately and have not seen a hint of sunburn.</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t normally gush about skincare products this much.</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t normally gush about skincare products this much.</li>
      <li>Olay, couldn&#x27;t you just put a cap that you click down and squirt out, like most moisturizers and liquids</li>
      <li>I have really sensitive skin, so I found this to be very non-greasy and pure formula.  </li>
      <li>This is good for the winter time but the SPF is a little too low for the summer time.</li>
      <li>Due to the mostly positive reviews, I ordered this product hoping it would fit the bill.  </li>
      <li>I also enjoy the fact it is unscented, my husband gets some dry skin and can use it on his face without suffering a &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; smell.</li>
      <li>I have simply fell in love with this facial moisturizer.</li>
      <li>This moisturizer was a quick (i.e., without any research), off-the-shelf purchase at a local drugstore.</li>
      <li>An older lady recommended this to me</li>
      <li>I bought this lotion because it&#x27;s non-pore-clogging and has a decent SPF.</li>
      <li>I would much prefer a top that lifted up, but it&#x27;s not a huge issue.</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>This is sort of funny, but when I used other sunscreen products my sweet dog didn&#x27;t like the smell</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen women with really wrinkly necks, so far mine is OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The all day  moisturizers really does what it says, I apply in the early Am hours an not one time</li>
      <li>After a long day, my skin still feels smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>but I mostly use it as face sunscreen everyday.</li>
      <li>However, it works well for my mom, who has normal skin.</li>
      <li>I use to use the Clinique dramatically different moisturizing lotion, but when they changed the formulation, it just didn&#x27;t feel right anymore.  </li>
      <li>Wearing sunscreen every day really does make a difference, but most sunscreens are just not suitable to wear every day on your face.  </li>
      <li>This product is very light and non greasy, has minimal to no scent, and I use it daily under just a compact powder makeup.  </li>
      <li>mother used the Olay moisturizer for years and it kept her face from developing all those fine tiny lines that come later in life.  </li>
      <li>Now it seems every other bottle is a bit different - like one bottle will be great and the other bottle will make me break out.</li>
      <li>but it is not strongly scented, it feels good on my skin (not too heavy, not too light), and it definitely moisturizes all day.</li>
      <li>What can I say about Olay products, new?  </li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and provides a great base for primer and makeup.</li>
      <li>If you have super dry skin, this is not for you.  </li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t break me out, and I have very sensitive, acne-prone skin.</li>
      <li>Small enough to fit in my pack, but more than enough goop for covering my face and hands for a week.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Makes my face feel moisturized and very soft after washing it.</li>
      <li>Animals are very sensitive to smells.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this to women with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I wish they would put a pump on the bottle or something, so that I wouldn&#x27;t be wasting so much lotion when I barely squeeze it</li>
      <li>I am even thinking to start the anti age treatments, its never too early!</li>
      <li>Be aware that this will give you a white cast</li>
      <li>The only reason I gave them 3 stars is because they have good customer service and because at least I did not waste a lot of my money.</li>
      <li>Once I saw it I needed to see if I would live up to the sensitive skin part.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t sticky or heavy, but does a good job of moisturizing and sun protection on average days.</li>
      <li>I love the non fragrance, it actually has a slight odor of chlorine, but in a very natural way.</li>
      <li>and it takes away my little fine lines I have around my eyes and</li>
      <li>I love this moisturizer, it&#x27;s easy to dispense and to apply, not too thick or too thin, doesn&#x27;t get skin or hands greasy and soaks in quickly.</li>
      <li>Along with an ever present wide brimmed hat, I can garden all day with no sunburn…and I burn easily.  </li>
      <li>My blemishes haven&#x27;t completely gone away, but ever since I began using this lotion, my skin has been noticeably clearer.</li>
      <li>I assume it&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores like my old lotion must have.</li>
      <li>I like this product I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>it leaves my face soft</li>
      <li>She looked young always.</li>
      <li>Her skin so soft.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve called it &amp;#34;Oil of Old Lady&amp;#34; for ever.....</li>
      <li>I use it on my face, neck and chest area and it leaves my skin soft.</li>
      <li>Overall I highly recommend this lotion!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 48 year old man and have been using this for 5 years.  </li>
      <li>My skin is alternately oily and flaky, and this is light enough not to aggravate the oil but moisturizing enough to prevent flaking.</li>
      <li>Olay Complete</li>
      <li>If I am not wearing makeup  I always use the Complete.</li>
      <li>I apply every morning after showering, and my skin is silky soft and not oily as a result.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>There is no harsh sunblock-y smell, or stinging when I apply it.</li>
      <li>This cream make my skin feel soft And hydrated.</li>
      <li>even use on babies and young children</li>
      <li>The sunscreen part has help much on beach outting an just being out day to day definitely will restock up on this.</li>
      <li>and this perticular one complete all day for sensitve skin</li>
      <li>WOW.</li>
      <li>This cream by far loves up to the hype #LOVEIT</li>
      <li>I would recommend trying this for anyone with sensitive skin or skin problems like acne or perioral dermatitis.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy or to too light.</li>
      <li>I have  used Olay products since I was a young girl.  </li>
      <li>so I know I&#x27;m getting some protection either in the direct sun or reflection from it, as in the car.  </li>
      <li>My skin absorbs it completely and it doesn&#x27;t interfere with the application of my make-up.</li>
      <li>and so far it&#x27;s cheapest here on amazon.</li>
      <li>I use Olay Complete on my face in the morning and at night before bed.</li>
      <li>Living in a sunny climate, I appreciate the complete protection from the sun.</li>
      <li>This moisturizer was not heavy and didn&#x27;t break me out.  </li>
      <li>It leaves skin soft and moisturized but does not leave a greasy feeling.</li>
      <li>Skin still soft, not greasy.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that most sunscreen containing facial lotions feel heavy on my face and irritate my skin.</li>
      <li>Every bit as good as the really expensive stuff.</li>
      <li>Also, several older relatives (70s and 80s) have had a basal cell skin cancer on their faces.</li>
      <li>i only use the classic formula with zinc.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 35 years old (soon to be 36) and I generally stay out of the sun, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about wrinkles yet!</li>
      <li>It keeps my face moisturized all day long but still feels really lightweight.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased many other more expensive face moisturizers for men, but I keep coming back to this lotion because it works so well.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think it was the moisturizer because I had also used a new face wash that same day.  </li>
      <li>So, for the last few years, I began to try many different face cleansers and lotions to solve the problem, and finally stumbled upon this one.</li>
      <li>I have trouble with clogged pores and I really thought since I already have such heavily oily skin that adding more moisture or oil would just send my skin into overload.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Scent is neutral and not strong, and goes away quickly.</li>
      <li>Finally, you should know that a little goes a long way -- it really does not take much to get full coverage of your face; I expect the bottle to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Finally, you should know that a little goes a long way -- it really does not take much to get full coverage of your face; I expect the bottle to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been using this lotion since last July and my face has never been so clear and so radiant.</li>
      <li>Careful how much you squeeze out, though.</li>
      <li>The regular Olay Complete causes a burning sensation on my face.</li>
      <li>This sensitive Olay has no such effect.</li>
      <li>Further, I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>(I have to bleach my face daily with 10% w/w peroxide) but Olay&#x27;s sensitive skin version works well for me, not making my skin too oily.</li>
      <li>I also get compliments that I look at least ten years younger than my age.  :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a short period of time and I like it so far.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say if the sunscreen works (its only SPF15 anyway), but it does not moisturize very well, or for very long....</li>
      <li>I personally do not need too much lotion as my face is neither too oily or dry.</li>
      <li>My old neutrogena had a little push pump and it came out much easier and controlled as opposed to just getting whatever the bottle decides to squirt at you.</li>
      <li>If I&#x27;m going to be out in the sun for a long time, I use a different product, with a high number, SPF 30 to 50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was difficult to find a daily moisturizer sunscreen that I liked...</li>
      <li>It makes my skin dry, flaky, and very sensitive.</li>
      <li>Other skin lotions - especially with ESF - make my skin oily and really shiney.</li>
      <li>I usually sunburn with even a small amount of exposure but this product is just the right texture, easy to use and a good base for my skin.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, with an oily chin area and dry cheeks.</li>
      <li>but my face would get dry near my eyes</li>
      <li>The odd thing is that it dries up really fast on your face.</li>
      <li>I bought another one exactly the same, in this size at Walmart a few days ago, it only cost $5, I paid $6 here on here Amazon</li>
      <li>I have tried other pricier high profile brands only to learn I have sensitivity to some of the ingredients used in their products.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t break me out and offers enough moisture for my dry skin.</li>
      <li>one is a little thicker and creamier, and it would be too much for my oily skin&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
      <li>I tend to get a little too much lotion when I squeeze.</li>
      <li>I really like how the SPF 15 is enough for my skin to counter the sun, but become a little darker over time.</li>

<li> and it is perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
<li> My skin is clear and looks great!</li>
<li> This is by far the best skin lotion I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
<li> When I bought this, I was expecting great results especially from all the great reviews about this.</li>
<li> It feels very light, not greasy or oily, and has almost no scent.</li>
<li> Very light and not tacky</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very light and silky feeling, and I don&#x27;t get &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34; from the sunscreen in it.  </li>

<li> Moisturizing, light pleasant fragrance, smooth texture and sunscreen.  </li>
<li> I love that it has SPF protection as that is very important.</li>
<li> This doesn&#x27;t do that at all, and the best part of all is it&#x27;s not greasy but actually leaves a kind of dry finish to my skin that is perfect for applying makeup.</li>
<li> Olay Complete is a very good moisturizer form a person like me who has oily skin.</li>

<li> It absorbs quickly into the skin and is not greasy.</li>
<li> This item doesn&#x27;t adequately moisturize and is greasy for my combination skin.</li>
<li> I was looking for a daily moisturizer that was light yet effective.  </li>
<li> But with this light formula I don&#x27;t have to use very much, and I don&#x27;t look like our Dalmatian.  </li>
<li> I received my order on time and was very satisfied with the entire ordering process from the buy.</li>
<li> the texture is pretty light.  </li>
<li> It is an old classic, and a good one.</li>

<li> no problems and keps it young looking too! :-)</li>
<li> olay has definitely the best skin care products, i have tried many brands in the past and always return to olay.</li>
<li> I will probably switch to something a little heavier in the winter, but this is great for summer.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s great for everyday use.  </li>
<li> I use this lotion everyday for my face - it&#x27;s great.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to cause breakouts and is useful to provide some sun protection.</li>
<li> A better choice would be Coppertone Sensitive Skin.  </li>
<li> So nice to only have to use one product to accomplish two things.  </li>
<li> I love Olay Complete.  </li>
<li> , I rarely wear any make up.</li>
<li> Achieves a fresh, hydrated look.</li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Olay Complete all day moisturizer for many years now.  </li>
<li> This is a nice basic moisturizer.  </li>
<li> its the only kind i can use that wont break me out with repeated use.</li>
<li> also think my skin is pretty soft since I&#x27;ve been using this, and I have not had any additional or unusual breakouts (the package says it is non-comedogenic), so that&#x27;s nice, as well.</li>
<li> and the price is right.</li>
<li> Within a minute of putting it on I can put my make up right over it.</li>
<li> It goes right into my face and doesn&#x27;t feel like I have anything on at all.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s just the right size to get through airport security.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a bit of an art to getting the right amount.</li>
<li> So light and high quality.</li>
<li> I was looking for a good daily moisturizer with some SPF protection for her mature skin, and this was the right balance of price and quality.</li>
<li> Love because no matter how much I use I never break out as with so many other moisturizers.</li>
<li> I have sensitive skin that irritates easily</li>
<li> At any rate, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this moisturizer.itional or unusual breakouts (the package says it is non-comedogenic), so that&#x27;s nice, as well.</li>
<li> Great every day facial lotion, especially since it contains SPF 15.  </li>
<li> My face is more oily to combination and this is one of the few moisturizers that does not make my face more oily.</li>
<li> Pro it smells very nice and not like the usual gag inducing smell of most low price sunscreens.</li>
<li> it does a great job of moisturizing my face for all day long, plus its also has a sunblock in it, which is so important and why i choose this over other moiturizers.</li>
<li> Thanks Olay!</li>
<li> I found better costs and now feel back in condition.</li>
<li> I guess this is one of those rare cases when I really can&#x27;t think of anything I don&#x27;t like about the product.</li>
<li> I guess this is one of those rare cases when I really can&#x27;t think of anything I don&#x27;t like about the product.</li>
<li> This is the first time that I&#x27;ve tried the product with sunscreen.  </li>
<li> All Day Moisturizer feels on my face at first.  </li>
<li> That was my first review.   </li>
<li> I also love that it has SPF 15, which we should all use daily.</li>
<li> This is my first moisturizer with sunscreen (shame on me)</li>
<li> Still found myself getting darker, but I&#x27;m finally learning more about SPF.</li>
<li> Bought this for my mother while Amazon was offering coupons on different Olay products, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
<li> It works very well under makeup too!</li>
<li> My face was soft and glowing,no scent, light, no grease, and soothing.</li>
<li> It also acts as a great base for makeup and helps my foundation go on smooth and silky and gives me a nice dewy finish.</li>
<li> Would have been even better if I could get it for the same price but not add on.</li>
<li> Obviously I would add a heavier sunblock for a more outdoorsy day though.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
<li> This is my favorite face moisturizer and I would recommend it for daily use.</li>
<li> I would not recommend it though unless you are willing to take the risk of buying a product that has to be used in a hurry before it expires.</li>
<li> even teen years,,,,the better off her skin will be.  </li>
<li> Oh and even though it does say all day, that means every three to four hours reapplying if you&#x27;re outside most of the time period.</li>
<li> Will be buying more of this in the future.</li>
<li> It makes my face feel so soft and smooth.</li>
<li> Also, not  expensive and works.</li>
<li> I like it, but I wish the sunscreen was a higher spf.</li>
<li> My mum only use olay for so many years.</li>
<li> wish the spf were higher.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s economical, goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and actually helps prevent breakouts by moisturizing just the right amount.</li>
<li> It feels nice on my skin and doesn&#x27;t have that overpowering scent that other sunblocks have.</li>
<li> My face is just so clean and clear when I get home after being in the sun</li>
<li> My skin has gotten more sensitive over the years, getting very red and/or irritated easily, and I am having no reaction whatsoever to the Sensitive Olay.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m very picky about moisturizers and this is one is exactly what I wanted.</li>
<li> Now I don&#x27;t blame the whole product line or brand only because it&#x27;s probably from the zinc oxide which is a natural sun protection barrier good for sensitive skin.</li>
<li> It absorbs quickly, isn&#x27;t greasy and offers protection from sun exposure.  </li>
<li> My skin is super sensitive .</li>
<li> I have super sensitive skin</li>
<li> Second it&#x27;s magic in a bottle because I have VERY sensitive skin and not every lotion for my skin works .</li>
<li> At first I used it on my face and neck, but as I got older, I needed a creamier moisturizer for my face as my skin became drier.</li>
<li> It is an amazing little moisturizer.</li>
<li> I have recently given up on this one and found another product to use - organic - because the chemical list on this seems huge.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s light enough</li>
<li> love any olay products...always as expected</li>
<li> i bought this expecting too much.</li>
<li> My tip is to use it a s a night and day cream after gentle washing and exfoliaiting the face.</li>
<li> You really will see a plumpness and radiance to your face in this space of time.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t moisturize very well but protects under the sun</li>
<li> This face cream really agrees with me.  </li>
<li> I really recommend it, for every age and skin type.</li>
<li> My face felt really refreshed.........  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s really worked  out well.  </li>
<li> After much research i purchased this product and I have no regrets.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I really like it.</li>
<li> Very moisturizing though.</li>
<li> It is light and not oily and you will appreciate the SPF of 15 decades later.  </li>
<li> My grandmother swears by Olay, and I really can&#x27;t blame her.</li>
<li> so can&#x27;t comment too much about it, but</li>
<li> gentle on skin.  </li>
<li> and this does not irritate my skin but can sometimes make my face oily if I apply too much.</li>
<li> but it dries up really fast when you put it on your face.&lt;br</li>
<li> This really helped add moisture to my skin.</li>
<li> and I usually only have to apply it once a day to keep my skin smooth and supple.</li>
<li> I have been using Olay my whole life.</li>
<li> It actually protect me from sun light as ot states</li>
<li> and this works really well for me.  </li>
<li> My face itched and burned so much</li>
<li> I really enjoy this product and when fall comes around again, I will definitely be getting another bottle of it.</li>
<li> highly recommend !</li>
<li> and she wouldn&#x27;t sit real close to me out  side.  </li>
<li> Does really well for my skin.</li>
<li> Since I don&#x27;t wear makeup, this was too much hassle for me.  </li>
<li> It is light which I need in a daily cream.</li>
<li> I really like the ways this lotion feels on my face.</li>
<li> Thanks.</li>
<li> Fast delivery</li>
<li> This stuff burns my eye fast.</li>
<li> This is very greasy and also made me break out.</li>
<li> I should have never made the switch because she really prefers Aveeno.</li>
<li> and this is the only moisturizer with sunscreen I&#x27;ve been able to find (besides my old product which started burning) that doesn&#x27;t burn my skin and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy on my face.</li>
<li> /&gt;It comes out in a very liquidy form, much more watery than other moisturizers.</li>
<li> The consistency and aroma is different from the original product, but it seems to work as well and it has the added benefit of sunscreen protection.</li>
<li> I have some other stuff,its lighter and ok for summer.</li>
<li> I have tried so many other costly sunscreen products, and found them all to be rather sticky.  </li>
<li> I love the mild SPF 15, I have been wearing it in all the sun we have been getting lately and have not seen a hint of sunburn.</li>
<li> , I don&#x27;t normally gush about skincare products this much.</li>
<li> , I don&#x27;t normally gush about skincare products this much.</li>
<li> Olay, couldn&#x27;t you just put a cap that you click down and squirt out, like most moisturizers and liquids</li>
<li> I have really sensitive skin, so I found this to be very non-greasy and pure formula.  </li>
<li> This is good for the winter time but the SPF is a little too low for the summer time.</li>
<li> Due to the mostly positive reviews, I ordered this product hoping it would fit the bill.  </li>
<li> I also enjoy the fact it is unscented, my husband gets some dry skin and can use it on his face without suffering a &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; smell.</li>
<li> I have simply fell in love with this facial moisturizer.</li>
<li> This moisturizer was a quick (i.e., without any research), off-the-shelf purchase at a local drugstore.</li>
<li> An older lady recommended this to me</li>
<li> I bought this lotion because it&#x27;s non-pore-clogging and has a decent SPF.</li>
<li> I would much prefer a top that lifted up, but it&#x27;s not a huge issue.</li>
<li> and I highly recommend it.  </li>
<li> This is sort of funny, but when I used other sunscreen products my sweet dog didn&#x27;t like the smell</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve seen women with really wrinkly necks, so far mine is OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> The all day  moisturizers really does what it says, I apply in the early Am hours an not one time</li>
<li> After a long day, my skin still feels smooth and soft.</li>
<li> but I mostly use it as face sunscreen everyday.</li>
<li> However, it works well for my mom, who has normal skin.</li>
<li> I use to use the Clinique dramatically different moisturizing lotion, but when they changed the formulation, it just didn&#x27;t feel right anymore.  </li>
<li> Wearing sunscreen every day really does make a difference, but most sunscreens are just not suitable to wear every day on your face.  </li>
<li> This product is very light and non greasy, has minimal to no scent, and I use it daily under just a compact powder makeup.  </li>
<li> mother used the Olay moisturizer for years and it kept her face from developing all those fine tiny lines that come later in life.  </li>
<li> Now it seems every other bottle is a bit different - like one bottle will be great and the other bottle will make me break out.</li>
<li> but it is not strongly scented, it feels good on my skin (not too heavy, not too light), and it definitely moisturizes all day.</li>
<li> What can I say about Olay products, new?  </li>
<li> Goes on smooth and provides a great base for primer and makeup.</li>
<li> If you have super dry skin, this is not for you.  </li>
<li> It also doesn&#x27;t break me out, and I have very sensitive, acne-prone skin.</li>
<li> Small enough to fit in my pack, but more than enough goop for covering my face and hands for a week.</li>
<li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
<li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
<li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
<li> Makes my face feel moisturized and very soft after washing it.</li>
<li> Animals are very sensitive to smells.  </li>
<li> Highly recommend this to women with sensitive skin.</li>
<li> I wish they would put a pump on the bottle or something, so that I wouldn&#x27;t be wasting so much lotion when I barely squeeze it</li>
<li> I am even thinking to start the anti age treatments, its never too early!</li>
<li> Be aware that this will give you a white cast</li>
<li> The only reason I gave them 3 stars is because they have good customer service and because at least I did not waste a lot of my money.</li>
<li> Once I saw it I needed to see if I would live up to the sensitive skin part.</li>
<li> It isn&#x27;t sticky or heavy, but does a good job of moisturizing and sun protection on average days.</li>
<li> I love the non fragrance, it actually has a slight odor of chlorine, but in a very natural way.</li>
<li> and it takes away my little fine lines I have around my eyes and</li>
<li> I love this moisturizer, it&#x27;s easy to dispense and to apply, not too thick or too thin, doesn&#x27;t get skin or hands greasy and soaks in quickly.</li>
<li> Along with an ever present wide brimmed hat, I can garden all day with no sunburn…and I burn easily.  </li>
<li> My blemishes haven&#x27;t completely gone away, but ever since I began using this lotion, my skin has been noticeably clearer.</li>
<li> I assume it&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores like my old lotion must have.</li>
<li> I like this product I have sensitive skin</li>
<li> it leaves my face soft</li>
<li> She looked young always.</li>
<li> Her skin so soft.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve called it &amp;#34;Oil of Old Lady&amp;#34; for ever.....</li>
<li> I use it on my face, neck and chest area and it leaves my skin soft.</li>
<li> Overall I highly recommend this lotion!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a 48 year old man and have been using this for 5 years.  </li>
<li> My skin is alternately oily and flaky, and this is light enough not to aggravate the oil but moisturizing enough to prevent flaking.</li>
<li> Olay Complete</li>
<li> If I am not wearing makeup  I always use the Complete.</li>
<li> I apply every morning after showering, and my skin is silky soft and not oily as a result.  </li>
<li> I have sensitive skin</li>
<li> There is no harsh sunblock-y smell, or stinging when I apply it.</li>
<li> This cream make my skin feel soft And hydrated.</li>
<li> even use on babies and young children</li>
<li> The sunscreen part has help much on beach outting an just being out day to day definitely will restock up on this.</li>
<li> and this perticular one complete all day for sensitve skin</li>
<li> WOW.</li>
<li> This cream by far loves up to the hype #LOVEIT</li>
<li> I would recommend trying this for anyone with sensitive skin or skin problems like acne or perioral dermatitis.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not too heavy or to too light.</li>
<li> I have  used Olay products since I was a young girl.  </li>
<li> so I know I&#x27;m getting some protection either in the direct sun or reflection from it, as in the car.  </li>
<li> My skin absorbs it completely and it doesn&#x27;t interfere with the application of my make-up.</li>
<li> and so far it&#x27;s cheapest here on amazon.</li>
<li> I use Olay Complete on my face in the morning and at night before bed.</li>
<li> Living in a sunny climate, I appreciate the complete protection from the sun.</li>
<li> This moisturizer was not heavy and didn&#x27;t break me out.  </li>
<li> It leaves skin soft and moisturized but does not leave a greasy feeling.</li>
<li> Skin still soft, not greasy.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve found that most sunscreen containing facial lotions feel heavy on my face and irritate my skin.</li>
<li> Every bit as good as the really expensive stuff.</li>
<li> Also, several older relatives (70s and 80s) have had a basal cell skin cancer on their faces.</li>
<li> i only use the classic formula with zinc.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m 35 years old (soon to be 36) and I generally stay out of the sun, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about wrinkles yet!</li>
<li> It keeps my face moisturized all day long but still feels really lightweight.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve purchased many other more expensive face moisturizers for men, but I keep coming back to this lotion because it works so well.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t think it was the moisturizer because I had also used a new face wash that same day.  </li>
<li> So, for the last few years, I began to try many different face cleansers and lotions to solve the problem, and finally stumbled upon this one.</li>
<li> I have trouble with clogged pores and I really thought since I already have such heavily oily skin that adding more moisture or oil would just send my skin into overload.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Scent is neutral and not strong, and goes away quickly.</li>
<li> Finally, you should know that a little goes a long way -- it really does not take much to get full coverage of your face; I expect the bottle to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Finally, you should know that a little goes a long way -- it really does not take much to get full coverage of your face; I expect the bottle to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I have been using this lotion since last July and my face has never been so clear and so radiant.</li>
<li> Careful how much you squeeze out, though.</li>
<li> The regular Olay Complete causes a burning sensation on my face.</li>
<li> This sensitive Olay has no such effect.</li>
<li> Further, I have sensitive skin</li>
<li> (I have to bleach my face daily with 10% w/w peroxide) but Olay&#x27;s sensitive skin version works well for me, not making my skin too oily.</li>
<li> I also get compliments that I look at least ten years younger than my age.  :)</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a short period of time and I like it so far.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t say if the sunscreen works (its only SPF15 anyway), but it does not moisturize very well, or for very long....</li>
<li> I personally do not need too much lotion as my face is neither too oily or dry.</li>
<li> My old neutrogena had a little push pump and it came out much easier and controlled as opposed to just getting whatever the bottle decides to squirt at you.</li>
<li> If I&#x27;m going to be out in the sun for a long time, I use a different product, with a high number, SPF 30 to 50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It was difficult to find a daily moisturizer sunscreen that I liked...</li>
<li> It makes my skin dry, flaky, and very sensitive.</li>
<li> Other skin lotions - especially with ESF - make my skin oily and really shiney.</li>
<li> I usually sunburn with even a small amount of exposure but this product is just the right texture, easy to use and a good base for my skin.</li>
<li> I have sensitive skin, with an oily chin area and dry cheeks.</li>
<li> but my face would get dry near my eyes</li>
<li> The odd thing is that it dries up really fast on your face.</li>
<li> I bought another one exactly the same, in this size at Walmart a few days ago, it only cost $5, I paid $6 here on here Amazon</li>
<li> I have tried other pricier high profile brands only to learn I have sensitivity to some of the ingredients used in their products.  </li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t break me out and offers enough moisture for my dry skin.</li>
<li> one is a little thicker and creamier, and it would be too much for my oily skin&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
<li> I tend to get a little too much lotion when I squeeze.</li>
<li> I really like how the SPF 15 is enough for my skin to counter the sun, but become a little darker over time.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been searching for something like this for a long time as the other oil-free options have too high of an SPF to actually get tan</li>
<li> There&#x27;s apparently a reason Olay&#x27;s been around for so long: they know what they&#x27;re doing!</li>
<li> With in a week my pimples decreased, my face was soft and glowing, i didn&#x27;t need make up to cover my huge pores because even they were less noticeable.</li>
<li> Even though it&#x27;s not a big bottle, it lasts a long time.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve also used it to protect tattoos from UV when outside for long periods and it seems to work well for that.</li>
<li> There is a minor con, wish the bottle had a different method of delivery.</li>
<li> I live in FL so a few years ago (</li>
<li> Until i found out that sometimes skin may actually be too dry and thus over compensates with oil thus causing pimples.</li>
<li> I have always dealt with red face and oily and dry.</li>
<li> I only put it on my dry cheeks, avoiding my t zone since that&#x27;s oily.</li>
<li> Seems to help with the skin type that has multiple areas of oily and dry.</li>
<li> My skin loves it and it keeps it moisturized for a long time without getting the dry feel even when being outside in the sun.</li>
<li> and I really need to be using something that has at least some sort of SPF (which Clinque doesn&#x27;t).  </li>
<li> as that&#x27;s how long I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
<li> Like i thought it would go away over time and absorb into my skin, but when I look back into the mirror a few hours later, I still had that white cast.</li>
<li> I have been using the product as long as it has been on the market</li>
<li> I will always use it as long as it works for me.</li>
<li> By night put slighty too much on so as the skin has to slowly drink it</li>
<li> and it really helps with dry and flaking skin in that delicate area.  </li>
<li> I figure if I start working on prevention NOW, when I reach that age, I&#x27;ll be less likely to develop the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> My only complaint is that it wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough, but that&#x27;s almost certainly because of my harsh acne medication.</li>
<li> No complaints other than I wish there was a larger bottle with a pump!</li>
<li> I would definitely recommend the buyer to other customers.</li>
<li> But will leave dry patches during winter.</li>
<li> I use this product in the winter to combat the dry skin on my face.  </li>
<li> It makes my dry cheeks greasy</li>
<li> I have dry skin on my forehead, nose, and cheeks.</li>
<li> My skin was also noticeably drier after this with dry patches all over my cheeks.  </li>
<li> Non greasy, fragrance free, absorbs fast, base for makeup, moisturizes, lasts all day and can be used under or over another product.</li>
<li> I have dry, acne-prone skin</li>
<li> Automatic relief for your skin even if you don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that dry.</li>
<li> My face breaks out in dry patches each time I used this product.  </li>
<li> (although it only has SPF 15 so an added sunscreen won&#x27;t hurt!), but not quite heavy enough for me for the colder months.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
<li> Not sure if it is old</li>
<li> Not near as thick and soft as other face lotion samples I&#x27;ve tried recently.</li>
<li> Have used Oil of Olay for years and have very few wrinkles at 57 years young.</li>
<li> Much of your skin tone and various ailments are due to heredity and while it&#x27;s difficult to fight those old genes, there is a lot you can do make those problems much less noticeable</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had one hair appointment so far since I started using this moisturizer, and my skin is much less dry -- few to no purple stains on my forehead</li>
<li> It is so lightweight, especially if you compare it to the typical sunscreen.  </li>
<li> ....will update later when i have used for a while...only have been using for a little over a week</li>
<li> I also noticed that in combination with using my acne treatments that my outbreaks weren&#x27;t as bad, but were getting better over time.</li>
<li> This is one of the few products I simply do not do without!  </li>
<li> Nothing worse than a very perfumery product that overpowers the senses.  </li>
<li> I spent hundereds of dollars</li>
<li> Looking for &amp;#34;mens&amp;#34; products, there was not much to choose from.</li>
<li> Not really.</li>
<li> Item as expected.</li>
<li> My skin is not really oily since I&#x27;ve used this.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll admit that I have tried the more expensive moisturizers from named make up companies but find them too thick and greasy or too runny and do no good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> My face is naturally oily at the end of a long day and this lotion seems to make it worse.</li>
<li> I have oily skin, so a little of this goes a long way, but it hasn&#x27;t caused any break outs (which I&#x27;m prone to)</li>
<li> A little but goes a long way</li>
<li> It has helped with the elasticity of my eyes and a little of the product goes a long way.</li>
<li> Going with this sunscreen I can go through several pros and very very little cons.</li>
<li> and she has only a small amount of wrinkles.)</li>
<li> Being the dumb person I am, I went ahead and bought the big version of this because I thought it was going to be my next holy grail item.</li>
<li> Other than that, no problems.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t realize I have it on like some the other products</li>
<li> I am comparing it with other sunscreens with Zinc Oxide.  </li>
<li> This is my other go-to moisturizer that is SPF 15.</li>
<li> Also, the bottle looks slightly different from the one I usually buy at the store.</li>
<li> I am not sure if the formula changed recently or if this is just not a uniform product.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not sticky or greasy like other sunscreens.</li>
<li> problem I have often had in the past due to dry skin is that when I dye my hair, the dye gets sucked into my skin and leaves purple stains on my forehead</li>
<li> All my life i have had bad acne and huge pores . . .</li>
<li> The only complaint I have is about the bottle.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t burn the already red and irritated spots from those ailments, at least on me....</li>
<li> Maybe that sounds silly, but way too much moisturizer comes out each time.</li>
<li> However, she slowly started shifting back to her Aveeno.</li>
<li> It does not have that greasy feel or weight the skin down.</li>
<li> I will burn down cities if they stop making it.</li>
<li> , I still don&#x27;t have even one slight wrinkle.  </li>
<li> SPF 15 means you have to reapply like every half hour or something?</li>
<li> The first time I used it my face itched like crazy.  </li>
<li> My face was horrible and I was starting to notice that I wasn&#x27;t looking as vibrant as I needed to for someone as young as I am.</li>
<li> , I like the fact that it has SPF 15 which helps a little bit to protect my skin from the sun.</li>
<li> I am not exaggerating (well maybe a little) but it brightens my face and people think that I have on powder in pictures.</li>
<li> If it was a little lighter weight, I would have given it 5 starts.</li>
<li> (I have a pale complexion and I dye my hair black).</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been buying expensive products for years, and now that I&#x27;ve moved to an extremely dry climate I could not keep enough moisture in my skin to keep it from flaking off.  </li>
<li> However, I&#x27;d like to KEEP my skin looking youthful, and I know that I do get some sun exposure just from doing everyday things like walking the dog or driving to work.</li>
<li> But it didn&#x27;t work when I over dried my skin a bit with soap.   </li>
<li> I use it everyday</li>
<li> Also not to heavy on the skin so it doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
<li> use it everyday.  </li>
<li> I like 2 in 1 products like this because applying two separate products can make my skin feel heavy or oily.</li>
<li> This is one of the few sunscreens that contain some concentration of zinc oxide for the face in the drugstore.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t like scented, heavy lotions and this product excels in these areas.</li>
<li> I wear it every day year round.</li>
<li> No oily and no strong smell.</li>
<li> This is a little thin and not for dry skin.  </li>
<li> No overwhelming fragrance.</li>
<li> The consistency of it is thin, not watery and sinks into the skin almost immediately without a greasy feel.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Furthermore, I&#x27;ve been using some rather harsh salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide treatments lately, and these are drying to my skin.</li>
<li> Not more oily, but oily looking sooner.</li>
<li> I usually just apply once in the morning</li>
<li> It is unbelievably thin-how do they do it?</li>
<li> but I usually put a layer of Aveeno underneath and</li>
<li> No break outs, sunscreen smell is present but faint.</li>
<li> i didn&#x27;t realize it was so small</li>
<li> Not sure why this happens.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a slick sheen, either.  </li>
<li> This is not a very good &amp;#34;all day moisturizer&amp;#34; with sunscreen -- it is a sunscreen with some moisturizing effects.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t want to think so hard when putting on moisturizer every day.</li>
<li> Goes on nicely, no fragrance, and well-priced.</li>
<li> i hate how much i paid for this based on the size.  </li>
<li> A few minutes after you apply, it doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue behind, and keeps my face moisturized all the time.</li>
<li> I have tried other face moisturizers and they are either too expensive or hard to find again or don&#x27;t work well or at all.</li>
<li> i use this every night &amp; no more wrinkles ever!</li>
<li> I end up looking ridiculous for a couple of days.</li>
<li> I tried the old-school Oil of Olay when I was in high school, and hated the greasy feel of it.</li>
<li> The bottle&#x27;s the weak point, though.</li>
<li> Also, this product does not have a fragrance to it (fragrances are particularly irritating to my skin).</li>
<li> Gave it a few tries after it made me break out the 1st day, but it is horrible!</li>
<li> My skin is horribly acne prone and incredibly sensitive.</li>
<li> Who could go wrong?</li>
<li> This stuff is not bank breakingly expensive either.</li>
<li> I will probably just be incredibly sad.</li>
<li> You can buy all that expensive garbage with alluring names or just use this.  </li>
<li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
<li> Some anti aging products are outrageous and I get complimented  that I look 10 yrs younger.</li>
<li> complaint is I hate the way the bottle dispenses.</li>
<li> Sorry!</li>
<li> when it arrived, I was a bit disappointed.</li>
<li> lots of SPF/sunscreens burn my face and smell terrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Both of my brothers and I have used this for years and love it.  It isn&#x27;t sticky or heavy, but does a good job of moisturizing and sun protection on average days.</li>
    <li> Smooth and it does seem to make my skin look more hydrated.  Careful how much you squeeze out, though.</li>
    <li> Its not my favorite moisturizer. I feel like it feels almost greasy, but I like the fact that it has SPF.</li>
    <li> It is a nice basis before makeup or a protection when I don&#x27;t feel like makeup.</li>
    <li> Olay is a brand I trust so I gotta give this 5 stars. Keeps my skin so moist and smooth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good and cheap product.And I would love to buy again and again.&lt;br /&gt;Thank u</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful, lightweight, non-greasy moisturizer. I love the mild SPF 15, I have been wearing it in all the sun we have been getting lately and have not seen a hint of sunburn. I also enjoy the fact it is unscented, my husband gets some dry skin and can use it on his face without suffering a &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; smell. It does not make your face feel oily or grimy and does not make you break out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years. It absorbs well, feels light, and protects my face from the sun, even when my neck, ears, shoulders get a sunburn.</li>
    <li> This is not a very good &amp;#34;all day moisturizer&amp;#34; with sunscreen -- it is a sunscreen with some moisturizing effects.  Even the directions on the bottle are for sunscreen use.  I can&#x27;t say if the sunscreen works (its only SPF15 anyway), but it does not moisturize very well, or for very long....</li>
    <li> I have been using Oil of Olay for more than 20 years.  It&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs into the skin.</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve turned 20, I have had problems with blemishes. So, for the last few years, I began to try many different face cleansers and lotions to solve the problem, and finally stumbled upon this one. It&#x27;s lightweight and definitely moisturizes just enough. I never feel like my face is oily or greasy. My blemishes haven&#x27;t completely gone away, but ever since I began using this lotion, my skin has been noticeably clearer. I assume it&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores like my old lotion must have. The only complaint I have is about the bottle. When you squeeze it, you either get no lotion, or the lotion explodes everywhere. I wish they would put a pump on the bottle or something, so that I wouldn&#x27;t be wasting so much lotion when I barely squeeze it and it all comes flying out.</li>
    <li> I have simply fell in love with this facial moisturizer. I&#x27;ve found that most sunscreen containing facial lotions feel heavy on my face and irritate my skin. This doesn&#x27;t do that at all, and the best part of all is it&#x27;s not greasy but actually leaves a kind of dry finish to my skin that is perfect for applying makeup. I would recommend this again and again!</li>
    <li> This is one of the few products I simply do not do without!  I&#x27;ve been using it for several years now, and people have commented how at age 66, I still don&#x27;t have even one slight wrinkle.  Thanks Olay!</li>
    <li> It feels nice on my skin and doesn&#x27;t have that overpowering scent that other sunblocks have. It also doesn&#x27;t break me out, and I have very sensitive, acne-prone skin. Love it</li>
    <li> The regular Olay Complete causes a burning sensation on my face. This sensitive Olay has no such effect. Love it!</li>
    <li> I like the SPF. I use this daily under my makeup. I suggest applying it and leaving it for several minutes before applying your make up. It needs time to absorb.</li>
    <li> What can I say about Olay products, new?  I love them all.  As does my mother, my daughters and granddaughters.</li>
    <li> Finally a high-quality, lower SPF sunscreen!  I&#x27;ve been searching for something like this for a long time as the other oil-free options have too high of an SPF to actually get tan (I realize others may disagree on this point - :)), but this does the trick perfectly.</li>
    <li> Olay Complete is a very good moisturizer form a person like me who has oily skin.It&#x27;s light enough so I don&#x27;t have breakouts,but yet moisturizing at the same time.I also benefit because of it&#x27;s sun protection.It has spf 15 along with vitamins.Who could go wrong?</li>
    <li> perfect for my sensitive face skin.&lt;br /&gt;my dermatologist recommended this lotion for my face. lots of SPF/sunscreens burn my face and smell terrible. this one is great! no scent, light, no grease, and soothing not irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended.</li>
    <li> love any olay products...always as expected</li>
    <li> This is a light moisturizer I like to carry in my gym bag. It&#x27;s okay and the price is right.</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer for years and I highly recommend it.  It absorbs quickly, isn&#x27;t greasy and offers protection from sun exposure.  Good stuff!  Arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
    <li> i bought this expecting too much. it works good, but isn&#x27;t great. i wouldn&#x27;t buy it again just because it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin the way i thought it would.</li>
    <li> Cheap and good smell. It fit for me to hike.</li>
    <li> Give it 2-3weeks and I gaurentee you will be glad you tried it, it is light and thirst quenching on the skin and seems to cover a multitued of tasks, you will not need seperate creams for eyes etc. My tip is to use it a s a night and day cream after gentle washing and exfoliaiting the face. By night put slighty too much on so as the skin has to slowly drink it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; You really will see a plumpness and radiance to your face in this space of time. This stuff is not bank breakingly expensive either.</li>
    <li> Olay offers excellent skin protection. I have used it for many years. Kind to sensitive skin like mine. A daily ritual!</li>
    <li> My favorite moisturizing lotion. I use it day and night.</li>
    <li> good for summer time. But will leave dry patches during winter.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t moisturize very well but protects under the sun</li>
    <li> Small enough to fit in my pack, but more than enough goop for covering my face and hands for a week.</li>
    <li> I use this every morning as my AM moisturizer and I love it. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with breakouts or anything with this product (combination skin).</li>
    <li> Breaks me out when I use it, every time!</li>
    <li> I tried the old-school Oil of Olay when I was in high school, and hated the greasy feel of it. Flash forward 15 years, and I was searching for a moisturizing cream for my still-somewhat-young-but-aging skin. I have sensitive skin, with an oily chin area and dry cheeks. I tried a variety of moisturizers from a variety of companies, from department stores to drug stores. This takes the cake. It&#x27;s economical, goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and actually helps prevent breakouts by moisturizing just the right amount. So glad I found this-and I&#x27;m extra happy that it has sunscreen in it!</li>
    <li> I like this product I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t cause me to breakout at all.  it leaves my face soft I have gotten comments since I started using it about how nice my skin looks</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I cannot understand why they are discontinuing it.  Perhaps if enough people let Olay know that we like it, they&#x27;ll continue to carry it.</li>
    <li> My skin is super sensitive . This doesn&#x27;t break me out. my skin looks smooth and youthful after applying it . It isn&#x27;t a matte moisturizer, I did get shine but I&#x27;ll take that over break outs any day.</li>
    <li> My Grandma said she only used Oil of Olay. She looked young always. Her skin so soft. Love it. I use it and so do my kids and so do my  grand kids.</li>
    <li> This face cream really agrees with me.  I love it.  No scent, so it&#x27;s good for me.</li>
    <li> So light and high quality. No overwhelming fragrance. It was difficult to find a daily moisturizer sunscreen that I liked... but this is it! Affordable too.</li>
    <li> This cream is the best, and the price is very good! I really recommend it, for every age and skin type.</li>
    <li> Keeps skin smooth all day or night.  Light and non greasy.  It&#x27;s a perfect pair with Olay face wash.  Even though it&#x27;s not a big bottle, it lasts a long time.  Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve called it &amp;#34;Oil of Old Lady&amp;#34; for ever.....as that&#x27;s how long I&#x27;ve used it. Unfortunately several years back I found it had sky rocketed in cost, thus diverted to another brand......when the tone of my skin began to reflect the difference...I found better costs and now feel back in condition.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing and great protection against the elements at a reasonable price. I have sensitive skin that irritates easily and this has always been kind to it.</li>
    <li> this lotion is just great. i use it to remove my make up and after shower. it is great moisture lotion fr sensitive skin, and customer servise is awesome.</li>
    <li> First and four most I got the package way before it was suppose to arrive! Second it&#x27;s magic in a bottle because I have VERY sensitive skin and not every lotion for my skin works . And this one works wonderfully. I use it every morning before I head out and it has SPF which is wonderful because it&#x27;s protecting me from the sun! I recommend this product to everyone. ENJOY!</li>
    <li> Great light daytime moisturizer for face and anywhere really. Doesn&#x27;t seem to cause breakouts and is useful to provide some sun protection. I&#x27;ve also used it to protect tattoos from UV when outside for long periods and it seems to work well for that.</li>
    <li> For reference, I&#x27;ve got oil/combination skin that is sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this lotion off and on for almost ten years. The consistency of it is thin, not watery and sinks into the skin almost immediately without a greasy feel.  The scent is very light and fades quickly. I use it on my face, neck and chest area and it leaves my skin soft. I think it&#x27;s a good summer moisturizer (although it only has SPF 15 so an added sunscreen won&#x27;t hurt!), but not quite heavy enough for me for the colder months.&lt;br /&gt;At the price of $6-$8, I think it&#x27;s a steal!</li>
    <li> Have used Oil of Olay for years and have very few wrinkles at 57 years young.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery. Best price too</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 35 years old (soon to be 36) and I generally stay out of the sun, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about wrinkles yet! However, I&#x27;d like to KEEP my skin looking youthful, and I know that I do get some sun exposure just from doing everyday things like walking the dog or driving to work. Also, several older relatives (70s and 80s) have had a basal cell skin cancer on their faces. I figure if I start working on prevention NOW, when I reach that age, I&#x27;ll be less likely to develop the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, I&#x27;ve been using some rather harsh salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide treatments lately, and these are drying to my skin. Ideally, I wanted a moisturizer with some sun protection that could also help keep my skin from drying out. This moisturizer was a quick (i.e., without any research), off-the-shelf purchase at a local drugstore. I have not used any Olay products in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product seems to be doing an excellent job, so far. While I can&#x27;t predict what will happen in 5 or 10 years, I&#x27;m very happy with the day-to-day benefits of using this moisturizer. I put this on in the morning before going to work and wash my face again about 10 hours later. During that time, my face does not look oily at all. Further, I have sensitive skin and I don&#x27;t notice any redness or irritation. Also, this product does not have a fragrance to it (fragrances are particularly irritating to my skin). So it truly is good for MY sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One problem I have often had in the past due to dry skin is that when I dye my hair, the dye gets sucked into my skin and leaves purple stains on my forehead (I have a pale complexion and I dye my hair black). I end up looking ridiculous for a couple of days. I&#x27;ve had one hair appointment so far since I started using this moisturizer, and my skin is much less dry -- few to no purple stains on my forehead this time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also think my skin is pretty soft since I&#x27;ve been using this, and I have not had any additional or unusual breakouts (the package says it is non-comedogenic), so that&#x27;s nice, as well. For what it&#x27;s worth, it&#x27;s easy to put on makeup (i.e., foundation) after applying this moisturizer. Finally, you should know that a little goes a long way -- it really does not take much to get full coverage of your face; I expect the bottle to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, I don&#x27;t normally gush about skincare products this much. I guess this is one of those rare cases when I really can&#x27;t think of anything I don&#x27;t like about the product. At any rate, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this moisturizer.itional or unusual breakouts (the package says it is non-comedogenic), so that&#x27;s nice, as well.

    <li> I have been using this lotion since last July and my face has never been so clear and so radiant. I get compliments all of the time on my skin and how clean it looks. I love the sunscreen as well, I never have to worry about getting burned on my face which is something you NEVER want to happen! Overall I highly recommend this lotion! Use it in conjunction with Cetaphil face wash and you&#x27;ll have great skin!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a several years. At first I used it on my face and neck, but as I got older, I needed a creamier moisturizer for my face as my skin became drier. I still buy this for my neck though. I&#x27;ve seen women with really wrinkly necks, so far mine is OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ultra sensative skin, this Olay doesn&#x27;t hurt when I put it on, I like the fact that it has SPF 15 which helps a little bit to protect my skin from the sun. If I&#x27;m going to be out in the sun for a long time, I use a different product, with a high number, SPF 30 to 50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I ordered this, I thought it was the larger size, so when it arrived, I was a bit disappointed. I bought another one exactly the same, in this size at Walmart a few days ago, it only cost $5, I paid $6 here on here Amazon, it&#x27;s good to shop around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for those who are just beginning to use a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 48 year old man and have been using this for 5 years.  It is an awesome product and my skin has never looked better.  Great for sensitive skin too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very picky about moisturizers and this is one is exactly what I wanted. My skin is alternately oily and flaky, and this is light enough not to aggravate the oil but moisturizing enough to prevent flaking. It feels very light, not greasy or oily, and has almost no scent. The sun protection has worked well for me, too. What more could you want?</li>
    <li> Great product. I have used it for years under makeup.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite sunscreen. I use it on my face, it is not oily, no skin breakout no irritation,  If my skin starts to feel hot, I can put some more on and it cools right off. I keep a bottle in my convertible, and I in the house..</li>
    <li> This stuff just feels good!  It&#x27;s also super convenient because it moisturizes my face while also protecting me from the sun.  I have oily skin, so a little of this goes a long way, but it hasn&#x27;t caused any break outs (which I&#x27;m prone to) and I&#x27;m hoping it will help me prevent wrinkles!  Time will tell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(My mom uses a version of this without the sunscreen and has been using it or products just like it for probably 20 years and she has only a small amount of wrinkles.)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom who swears by this moisturizer. The price was great and it arrived on time so that I was able to give it to her in her Christmas basket.</li>
    <li> When I bought this, I was expecting great results especially from all the great reviews about this. I suffer acne and I was hoping this would help it go away without clogging my pores. Being the dumb person I am, I went ahead and bought the big version of this because I thought it was going to be my next holy grail item. Yet, when I put this all over my face it gave me a white cast no matter how many times I massaged this into my face. Like i thought it would go away over time and absorb into my skin, but when I look back into the mirror a few hours later, I still had that white cast. Now I don&#x27;t blame the whole product line or brand only because it&#x27;s probably from the zinc oxide which is a natural sun protection barrier good for sensitive skin. It&#x27;s probably just this product but if you don&#x27;t mind looking like the white lady be my guest.</li>
    <li> Since I have always used Olay products and they appeared to work, I gave it as a gift and I believe that person will like it too.</li>
    <li> good product does what it says oil of olay products a good used it for my trip to mexico last month and the price was great</li>
    <li> Light moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling greasy or overly-coated.  I do wish, however, that it came with a pump. It is easy to get too much product when using the tilt-and-squeeze method</li>
    <li> Great looks good good price i like it I hope to see god results with this product as i hope olay is good</li>
    <li> Product as described - Fast Shipping - Very Satisfied!!!</li>
    <li> My face is naturally oily at the end of a long day and this lotion seems to make it worse. Not more oily, but oily looking sooner. Other than that, no problems.</li>
    <li> wonderful leaves my skin feeling great and works well in the sun its a must buy product if going out in the sun i even put it on my arms</li>
    <li> I brought this for my sister as a gift. She had no complaints about it so I assume that everything was ok.</li>
    <li> I have been using Oil of Olay for more than 30 years and haven&#x27;t found a product that I like better.  This is the first time that I&#x27;ve tried the product with sunscreen.  The consistency and aroma is different from the original product, but it seems to work as well and it has the added benefit of sunscreen protection.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and goes on easily. I don&#x27;t realize I have it on like some the other products</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer, it&#x27;s easy to dispense and to apply, not too thick or too thin, doesn&#x27;t get skin or hands greasy and soaks in quickly. My skin loves it and it keeps it moisturized for a long time without getting the dry feel even when being outside in the sun. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, I use it for my face every morning it does not irritate and it is not greasy. I would recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a daily lotion to keep your skin hydrated</li>
    <li> I really liked the way Olay Complete All Day Moisturizer feels on my face at first.  I am comparing it with other sunscreens with Zinc Oxide.  My face felt really refreshed.........  That was my first review.   It did work when my skin was in really good shape.  But it didn&#x27;t work when I over dried my skin a bit with soap.   I decided to try Eucerin  Daily Protection Moisturizing Face lotion.  It&#x27;s really worked  out well.  If you are looking for a sunscreen with ZINC OXIDE for ACNE TREATMENT, this is 3.0%.  A better choice would be Coppertone Sensitive Skin.  Coppertone is 14.5% ZINC OXIDE  (Desitin Diaper Rash Cream is 13%)</li>
    <li> Worked good at first but my face would get dry near my eyes so I stopped using. May work better for someone else, just didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
    <li> This is my other go-to moisturizer that is SPF 15. It has a perfect texture and works very well and I will buy again.</li>
    <li> If I am not wearing makeup  I always use the Complete. I have been using the product as long as it has been on the market</li>
    <li> Great light weight everyday lotion with sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  My skin has gotten more sensitive over the years, getting very red and/or irritated easily, and I am having no reaction whatsoever to the Sensitive Olay.  I apply every morning after showering, and my skin is silky soft and not oily as a result.  I used to use the Aveeno Calming lotion, but that actually made me REDDER after a while, so I&#x27;m sticking with this going forward.  I also love that it has SPF 15, which we should all use daily.</li>
    <li> I really love this moisturizer. It rubs in so quickly And does not  feel greasy at all. Within a minute of putting it on I can put my make up right over it. I love that it has SPF protection as that is very important.</li>
    <li> I love Olay, I have used it most of my life.  No one ever takes me for my age and I LOVE that!!!</li>
    <li> All my life i have had bad acne and huge pores . . . Until i found out that sometimes skin may actually be too dry and thus over compensates with oil thus causing pimples. After much research i purchased this product and I have no regrets.&lt;br /&gt;I use it just after I shower on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt; With in a week my pimples decreased, my face was soft and glowing, i didn&#x27;t need make up to cover my huge pores because even they were less noticeable. I will continue to use this product. I am even thinking to start the anti age treatments, its never too early!</li>
    <li> Great for my acne prone sensitive skin. I use it everyday and I have not complaints. It is not oily at all and I also have oily skin so I am happy about that. The fragrance is mild and the formula is creamy.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and it broke me out.&lt;br /&gt;My sister uses it and she loves it.  I think it has to do with your skin type</li>
    <li> Moisturizing, light pleasant fragrance, smooth texture and sunscreen.  I love Oil of Olay products. Now i carry this one everywhere.</li>
    <li> I love this cream, recommended by my dermatologist years ago. It goes right into my face and doesn&#x27;t feel like I have anything on at all.</li>
    <li> Keeping my skin moist and protecting it against the sun is a great two-in-one product. It absorbs into the skin quickly and helps your skin appear radiant.</li>
    <li> This is my first moisturizer with sunscreen (shame on me) and I have to say I am pleased! I have sensitive skin and this did not break me out or anything. I did not notice a smell and it settled in quite quickly. Wish I had ordered two like I was planning too, but oh well.</li>
    <li> I go out in the sun everyyyday. I observed my skin and saw the difference while using this stuff, so thank you!</li>
    <li> I use it on my face, chest, and arms.  It is so lightweight, especially if you compare it to the typical sunscreen.  I really like it.</li>
    <li> No dyes, no perfumes. sunscreen included a plus.</li>
    <li> I bought this on my husband&#x27;s account.  This is a great moisturizer and I love the fact that it also is a sunscreen!  So nice to only have to use one product to accomplish two things.  I use this product before I put make-up on and it works great; lightweight and non-greasy.  I use it especially around my eyes and it really helps with dry and flaking skin in that delicate area.  It is a nice, everyday lotion that smells great and works well!</li>
    <li> If you want a good all around moisturizer with sunscreen at a great price, this is it.  Just the right amount of sunscreen and it leaves my face smooth and feeling good.</li>
    <li> This is really a good deal for the price. Also not to heavy on the skin so it doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
    <li> great for the face love it</li>
    <li> always my dad&#x27;s favorite.</li>
    <li> I use this product in the winter to combat the dry skin on my face.  I have very sensitive skin and this is the only lotion that doesn&#x27;t burn and cause redness.  It works well.</li>
    <li> This face cream is very light and easy to apply. There is no harsh sunblock-y smell, or stinging when I apply it. Also, my skin absorbs it well.</li>
    <li> I use every morning. Still found myself getting darker, but I&#x27;m finally learning more about SPF. SPF 15 means you have to reapply like every half hour or something? I usually just apply once in the morning and I&#x27;m out for the day, so that&#x27;s my own fault. Very moisturizing though. and it doesn&#x27;t leave residue</li>
    <li> My favorite every day moisturizer. Goes on smooth and provides a great base for primer and makeup. No complaints other than I wish there was a larger bottle with a pump!</li>
    <li> I have always dealt with red face and oily and dry. This is great for sunscreen and makes my face feel cool instantly. I love the non fragrance, it actually has a slight odor of chlorine, but in a very natural way. I cant stand any fragrance and enjoy this.</li>
    <li> love this sunscreen lotion I use it every day and it suits me well I would recommend this to a friend you can try it too</li>
    <li> This is a little thin and not for dry skin.  It&#x27;s o.k. for a daily moisturizer but I would like one that is more emollient.</li>
    <li> I love it is why I give this an A+. Great lotion and feels very good on my skin. I do recommend this lotion.</li>
    <li> I always purchase this. It&#x27;s great because I live in a sunny climate and have sensitive skin. This cream make my skin feel soft And hydrated.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mother while Amazon was offering coupons on different Olay products, and I&#x27;m glad I did. I was looking for a good daily moisturizer with some SPF protection for her mature skin, and this was the right balance of price and quality. I will repurchase when she runs out.</li>
    <li> Not as greasy as most but I mostly use it as face sunscreen everyday. Doesn&#x27;t clog pores or have a strong smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this one for about 2 years now. It good and for a decent price</li>
    <li> This is the perfect cream to wear every day under make-up.  It is light and not oily and you will appreciate the SPF of 15 decades later.  Wearing sunscreen every day really does make a difference, but most sunscreens are just not suitable to wear every day on your face.  Both my husband (with rosacea) and my son like this cream because it doesn&#x27;t make them break out and it&#x27;s smell is not too girly.  I like it because it doesn&#x27;t make my make-up smear and has the SPF.</li>
    <li> I bought this one online because my OofO bottle was getting low.&lt;br /&gt;As it turns out, it was NOT the same one I buy when shopping in person.&lt;br /&gt;This one is a little thicker and creamier, and it would be too much for my oily skin&lt;br /&gt;on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT.... this one is GREAT for your hands and arms!&lt;br /&gt;Hands are one of the first places to look old, and we often neglect them.&lt;br /&gt;This has been fabulous for my hands.</li>
    <li> This moisturize feels so good on my skin. It does not have that greasy feel or weight the skin down. I love it and would buy again.</li>
    <li> This is my Holy Grail moisturizer! My grandmother swears by Olay, and I really can&#x27;t blame her. I have very sensitive skin and can confidently wear this without worrying about break outs. It works very well under makeup too!</li>
    <li> My mom has been using this for years. This is the only thing that works for her</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and have always liked it.  My mom also loved it, before she passed away.  This was a great deal; I saved money by ordering the bundle</li>
    <li> I love Olay Complete.  It is just the best!  Thank you.  I will always use it as long as it works for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still in my 20s so can&#x27;t comment too much about it, but I notice that when I wear it, it definitely smoothes out my pores for hours. I get acne easily (I have to bleach my face daily with 10% w/w peroxide) but Olay&#x27;s sensitive skin version works well for me, not making my skin too oily.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is truly a must have. It is unbelievably thin-how do they do it? I can&#x27;t stand greasy products on my hands, let alone my face. This truly fits the bill. Protection all day and keeps my skin feeling smooth and refreshed. Just awesome.</li>
    <li> use it everyday.  light and non greasy, goes well under make up.  gentle on skin.  even use on babies and young children</li>
    <li> Excellent product to be used alone or under makeup.  I like the fact it includes sunscreen for extra skin protection.</li>
    <li> Works great and smells nice .</li>
    <li> Light and works great on my sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Does everything I want from a moisturizer, without being greasy. Have used it for years.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer with sunscreen for the face. I have oily to combination skin and this does not irritate my skin but can sometimes make my face oily if I apply too much. I like 2 in 1 products like this because applying two separate products can make my skin feel heavy or oily.This is one of the few sunscreens that contain some concentration of zinc oxide for the face in the drugstore. I only apply this product on my face in the morning and nothing else. Be aware that this will give you a white cast but however, it will eventually fade away as you work the product into your skin. This is good for the winter time but the SPF is a little too low for the summer time. The packaging is not the greatest and can make a mess inside the cap.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this uses it every day.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It smells good but it is not strongly scented, it feels good on my skin (not too heavy, not too light), and it definitely moisturizes all day.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I will use during the day and sometimes at night.  I like to use one of their regenerous products at night.  With the regular Olay my skin used to get an oily feel too it and I would break out but the sensitive line works great.  I have been using this product for at least 8 years and will continue, worth the price.  I also get compliments that I look at least ten years younger than my age.  :)</li>
    <li> Olay makes such great products and I can really tell the difference on my face!</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer,  ive been using it for a couple months now and its one of the best ive used and you cant complain with the price!&lt;br /&gt;Im 19 and it takes away my little fine lines I have around my eyes and my skin feels plump... definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer,perfect for my sensitive face skin. My face was soft and glowing,no scent, light, no grease, and soothing.I love it!</li>
    <li> I really liked this moisturizer a lot.&lt;br /&gt;It has no smell, which is great.  Nothing worse than a very perfumery product that overpowers the senses.  It is very creamy and goes in really smooth and absorbs well into the skin very quickly.  I have really sensitive skin, so I found this to be very non-greasy and pure formula.  It really feels great on my skin.  This along with having the UV15 to guard against the Rays makes it an awesome moisturizer.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I have dry acne prone skin and this product works great with my skin type. It keeps my face moisturized all day long but still feels really lightweight. It also acts as a great base for makeup and helps my foundation go on smooth and silky and gives me a nice dewy finish. The SPF 15 is a plus. Its wonderful to find a lotion that really moisturizes yet doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. A+ in my book!</li>
    <li> Overall I like it but it dries up really fast when you put it on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes out in a very liquidy form, much more watery than other moisturizers. The odd thing is that it dries up really fast on your face. I like it but I usually put a layer of Aveeno underneath and then this layer on top as this alone wouldn&#x27;t be able to moisturize my face. I like the spf benefit.</li>
    <li> The all day  moisturizers really does what it says, I apply in the early Am hours an not one time have I need to apply more. It has a smooth easy apply feel, does not make me feel like im putting cream on at all. The sunscreen part has help much on beach outting an just being out day to day definitely will restock up on this. An the delivery time was faster then the estimated date.</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive acne prone skin!</li>
    <li> Just buy it! My face is just so clean and clear when I get home after being in the sun and I do not have that burnt look anymore.  When I take pictures, with just this on, my face looks so refreshed as if I just washed it and flawless. I am not exaggerating (well maybe a little) but it brightens my face and people think that I have on powder in pictures. I am truly, very pleased!</li>
    <li> I received my order on time and was very satisfied with the entire ordering process from the buy. I would definitely recommend the buyer to other customers.</li>
    <li> Gave it a few tries after it made me break out the 1st day, but it is horrible! Also, the bottle looks slightly different from the one I usually buy at the store. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love some SPF but this caused me to break out.  I wish I could use it because it is certainly cheap.  Bonus points for fragrance free.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer ever! It something that I will use for the rest of my life. It doesn&#x27;t break me out and offers enough moisture for my dry skin.</li>
    <li> my wife said eee its okay</li>
    <li> I like the light feel of it and it&#x27;s just the right size to get through airport security.</li>
    <li> Awesome for sensitive skin...no problems and keps it young looking too! :-)</li>
    <li> I  alternate daily with different products but this is one of my favorites.  Lightweight moisture and sun protection here in S. Florida is essential.</li>
    <li> I am over 50 and have used this for years, it works the best. I have some other stuff,its lighter and ok for summer. This is really great in the winter weather . poepl comment all the time on how lovely my skin is, I rarely wear any make up.</li>
    <li> i love this product its not greasy, and not cakey feeling. it does a great job of moisturizing my face for all day long, plus its also has a sunblock in it, which is so important and why i choose this over other moiturizers. i wish i would have used this when i was younger to protect my face, but oh well i can only learn from my mistakes!</li>
    <li> I like that this moisturizer doesn&#x27;t have a smell and the texture is pretty light.  It gets absorbed easily.  Definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I like this product works well</li>
    <li> Great every day facial lotion, especially since it contains SPF 15.  No fragrance and not oily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many other more expensive face moisturizers for men, but I keep coming back to this lotion because it works so well. I don&#x27;t like scented, heavy lotions and this product excels in these areas. It has no scent and is extremely light. It absorbs quickly into the skin and is not greasy. The SPF protection is great feature as well and comes in handy when I get into the sun for longer periods. Overall, if you are working for a great daily face lotion that is not greasy and won&#x27;t break the bank this is a great option.</li>
    <li> I know for shore I didn&#x27;t Oder two of these 😳  don&#x27;t have a sent. Maybe it just sunscreen</li>
    <li> years ago, i used to get wrinkles around my mouth when i was tired.now i use this every night &amp; no more wrinkles ever!</li>
    <li> great, works well and keeps my skin hydrated</li>
    <li> I love it. I absolutely love this moisturizer. I use it especially when I am going to be spending time in the out of doors. It feels great on my face. I always have a bottle of this in my bathroom closet. I would not be without it. It isn&#x27;t extremely costly so that is a great plus, too. I recommend it for most people.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t give a good rating for any cosmetic  that does not list ingredients--I want to know what I am putting on my face;  For&lt;br /&gt;example, I don&#x27;t want a cosmetic with paraben  in it.  This product listed no ingredients.  I threw it out.  Sorry!</li>
    <li> love this stuff! Fast ship- great price!</li>
    <li> This item doesn&#x27;t adequately moisturize and is greasy for my combination skin. I only put it on my dry cheeks, avoiding my t zone since that&#x27;s oily. It makes my dry cheeks greasy and I don&#x27;t need that. However, it works well for my mom, who has normal skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this for many years, and now my daughter has followed in my footsteps.&lt;br /&gt;We both love the fresh feeling it gives the skin.  Very light and not tacky</li>
    <li> Have used for years. Seems to help with the skin type that has multiple areas of oily and dry. This helps level it out some.</li>
    <li> Good deal as an add on item. Would have been even better if I could get it for the same price but not add on.</li>
    <li> have used for many years and love it. SPF 15 is great to have every day</li>
    <li> Good product.....good service and price</li>
    <li> No break outs, sunscreen smell is present but faint. Feels great and not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> i hate how much i paid for this based on the size.  i didn&#x27;t realize it was so small or i would have just gone to CVS.</li>
    <li> the best - I love it.</li>
    <li> Let me tell you, I&#x27;m a veteran at moisturizer and i&#x27;ve been thru it all , divorced break up to make up&lt;br /&gt;with all these products.. lol... this is my dovoted one.. what it says it delivers wit seriously magnificent results.&lt;br /&gt;you dont need much, just have a good cleanser.. and use a lil bit rub it gently around your face.. drink plenty of water&lt;br /&gt;use this day and night.... give it about one month, and watch this baby go to work.. im not Lying I spent hundereds of dollars&lt;br /&gt;and waisted them all... what i realize for best skin products come from not expensive over hyped adds.. but the names that&lt;br /&gt;have great establishment and history like Olay..  and this perticular one complete all day for sensitve skin is the best for sensetive skin so dont deviate from it if u have sensitive skin this is your best chance to control your oil and have even skin tone..</li>
    <li> This really helped add moisture to my skin. it is light a weightless. A little but goes a long way and I usually only have to apply it once a day to keep my skin smooth and supple.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if the formula changed recently or if this is just not a uniform product. I have been using Olay my whole life. I have great skin too. I live in FL so a few years ago (7 now I think) I started using this one. It has never given me a problem until last year. Now it seems every other bottle is a bit different - like one bottle will be great and the other bottle will make me break out. Not sure why this happens. I have recently given up on this one and found another product to use - organic - because the chemical list on this seems huge. I would love to see Olay do an organic line.</li>
    <li> Takes a lot of it to keep my face moisturized</li>
    <li> Once I saw it I needed to see if I would live up to the sensitive skin part. I apply the cream each day only once it actually last all day WOW. I love it doesnt feel like im added cream goes on smooth no smell great . It actually protect me from sun light as ot states an I work out doors so its need. This cream by far loves up to the hype #LOVEIT</li>
    <li> Male perspective: Medium weight, non oily. Scent is neutral and not strong, and goes away quickly. I have dry skin on my forehead, nose, and cheeks. Looking for &amp;#34;mens&amp;#34; products, there was not much to choose from. What there was to choose from, I would break out from them. I gave up on &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; products and switched to this. The wife and I can both use it. If it was a little lighter weight, I would have given it 5 starts.</li>
    <li> I really love this moisterizer.  I have very sensitive skin and this works really well for me.  The SPF is also great to have in this product.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a daily moisturizer that was light yet effective.  Due to the mostly positive reviews, I ordered this product hoping it would fit the bill.  The first time I used it my face itched like crazy.  I didn&#x27;t think it was the moisturizer because I had also used a new face wash that same day.  The next day I only put this on and had the same result.  My face itched and burned so much I had to go wash this product off.  My skin was also noticeably drier after this with dry patches all over my cheeks.  I immediately threw this away and will continue to search.</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel moisturized and very soft after washing it. Would recommend if you&#x27;re in need of a good moisturizer!</li>
    <li> A great moisturizer that keeps everything moist and feel brand new. I feel like I have baby skin.</li>
    <li> I love Olay products....and i like this lotion ....will update later when i have used for a while...only have been using for a little over a week</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a variety of other moisturizers, but this is the best!</li>
    <li> Sticky feeling remains.  Not sure if it is old or maybe it was stored incorrectly.</li>
    <li> Non greasy, fragrance free, absorbs fast, base for makeup, moisturizes, lasts all day and can be used under or over another product. Olay lotions are the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I will burn down cities if they stop making it. Not really. I will probably just be incredibly sad. Love olay.</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin and this is the only moisturizer with sunscreen I&#x27;ve been able to find (besides my old product which started burning) that doesn&#x27;t burn my skin and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy on my face. I love this, it feels very gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. I would recommend trying this for anyone with sensitive skin or skin problems like acne or perioral dermatitis. It doesn&#x27;t burn the already red and irritated spots from those ailments, at least on me....and I tried a lot of different things before this. Also the sunblock part works great. My sun freckles faded after a week on this...it has zinc which is the best sunblock you can get. Obviously I would add a heavier sunblock for a more outdoorsy day though.&lt;br /&gt;One complaint is I hate the way the bottle dispenses. My old neutrogena had a little push pump and it came out much easier and controlled as opposed to just getting whatever the bottle decides to squirt at you.</li>
    <li> The moisturizer itself is fine. My issue is with the design of the bottle. Maybe that sounds silly, but way too much moisturizer comes out each time. It&#x27;s a bit of an art to getting the right amount. Olay, couldn&#x27;t you just put a cap that you click down and squirt out, like most moisturizers and liquids have? I don&#x27;t want to think so hard when putting on moisturizer every day.</li>
    <li> My mom, my sister, and I have been using this since I was a teen, still the best cream out there. We use it twice a day, under a primer or Olay regenerist serum. Then make-up. Achieves a fresh, hydrated look.</li>
    <li> almost time to reorder</li>
    <li> Nice stuff.  Works well under makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a short period of time and I like it so far. No oily and no strong smell.</li>
    <li> YES.  I&#x27;ve been buying expensive products for years, and now that I&#x27;ve moved to an extremely dry climate I could not keep enough moisture in my skin to keep it from flaking off.  An older lady recommended this to me and I thought she was just being a grandma…until I tried it.  Wonderful moisturizer - my skin is not flaky, and it has a really plump, healthy look when I use this consistently.  When I visit more humid climates, this doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily - which seems counterintuitive, but it&#x27;s true. I&#x27;m a convert.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to need something stronger soon. Not near as thick and soft as other face lotion samples I&#x27;ve tried recently.</li>
    <li> My favorite moisturizer. Pleasant feel, keeps skin soft and supple and contains sunscreen. Every bit as good as the really expensive stuff.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face moisturizer and I would recommend it for daily use. I have tried other face moisturizers and they are either too expensive or hard to find again or don&#x27;t work well or at all. I usually sunburn with even a small amount of exposure but this product is just the right texture, easy to use and a good base for my skin.</li>
    <li> The bottle looks like it is a defective item. The label is crooked and the moisturizer expires in six months. I bought it in december and the expiration date is 06/2014. The only reason I gave them 3 stars is because they have good customer service and because at least I did not waste a lot of my money. I would not recommend it though unless you are willing to take the risk of buying a product that has to be used in a hurry before it expires. May the odds be ever in your favor.</li>
    <li> I also buy this product at stores if it is on sale, Amazon seems to have the best price.  This product goes on well and soaks in within 5 minutes, so you can apply your face liquid makeup very quickly without feeling greasy.  I also use it on my hands.  Love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy or to too light.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve have used this product for many years and basically it works for me. I have tried other pricier high profile brands only to learn I have sensitivity to some of the ingredients used in their products.  I have  used Olay products since I was a young girl.  I used my Mom&#x27;s and my Grandmothers Night of Olay creams when I could! LOL :)</li>
    <li> Every woman needs a daily moisturizer and the younger she starts....even teen years,,,,the better off her skin will be.  Much of your skin tone and various ailments are due to heredity and while it&#x27;s difficult to fight those old genes, there is a lot you can do make those problems much less noticeable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Olay Complete all day moisturizer for many years now.  I find it to be non greasy and have no scent.  I like the fact that it has a SPF 15 so I know I&#x27;m getting some protection either in the direct sun or reflection from it, as in the car.  My skin absorbs it completely and it doesn&#x27;t interfere with the application of my make-up. I&#x27;ll admit that I have tried the more expensive moisturizers from named make up companies but find them too thick and greasy or too runny and do no good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother used the Olay moisturizer for years and it kept her face from developing all those fine tiny lines that come later in life.  A good regimen of thoroughly cleansing and then following up with the olay has kept my skin bright and healthy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s creamy and good for my sensitive skin. It doesn&#x27;t leave a slick sheen, either.  The bottle&#x27;s the weak point, though. It would be better if there was a pump.</li>
    <li> I have used Olay for about 30 years and love the way it softens my face without being greasy or oily.</li>
    <li> My face was horrible and I was starting to notice that I wasn&#x27;t looking as vibrant as I needed to for someone as young as I am. (I bought this product when I was 24 and I am now 26). My skin is horribly acne prone and incredibly sensitive. I have trouble with clogged pores and I really thought since I already have such heavily oily skin that adding more moisture or oil would just send my skin into overload.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be more wrong. After a month or two of using the product I noticed that my skin had a healthy glow, I noticed that I wasn&#x27;t as oily. I also noticed that in combination with using my acne treatments that my outbreaks weren&#x27;t as bad, but were getting better over time. It has helped with the elasticity of my eyes and a little of the product goes a long way. I have had the same bottle for over two years and I just cannot seem to finish the product. It is an amazing little moisturizer. I really like how the SPF 15 is enough for my skin to counter the sun, but become a little darker over time. I really enjoy this product and when fall comes around again, I will definitely be getting another bottle of it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for years I love it! It has SPF in it too! ?I feel like it keeps my face mositurrized all day and the SPF also helps. It works great under make up .I highly recommend !</li>
    <li> This product is very light and non greasy, has minimal to no scent, and I use it daily under just a compact powder makeup.  Along with an ever present wide brimmed hat, I can garden all day with no sunburn…and I burn easily.  I wear it every day year round. and it is perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> If I was using this just as a moisturizer I would probably only give it 3 stars. I found that mixing it with my foundation creates a beautiful sheer coverage on my good skin days. I use this most days and will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> All 3  arrived in great condition, and I use quite a lot of this product in the Summer time. I have tried so many other costly sunscreen products, and found them all to be rather sticky.  I am handicapped and like to sit outside in good weather. I used to freckle up so much, even though many sunscreens say up to 30 minutes.  But with this light formula I don&#x27;t have to use very much, and I don&#x27;t look like our Dalmatian.  This is sort of funny, but when I used other sunscreen products my sweet dog didn&#x27;t like the smell and she wouldn&#x27;t sit real close to me out  side.  Animals are very sensitive to smells.  It is a very nice product, and I&#x27;m sure that other customers will enjoy it also as the moisturizer keeps the skin so nice and soft.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much.  Does really well for my skin.</li>
    <li> I have dry, acne-prone skin and I have been using a topical for over a year. It makes my skin dry, flaky, and very sensitive. I bought this lotion because it&#x27;s non-pore-clogging and has a decent SPF. It did not irritate my skin at all or leave a white film. My only complaint is that it wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough, but that&#x27;s almost certainly because of my harsh acne medication.</li>
    <li> Really good product. A few minutes after you apply, it doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue behind, and keeps my face moisturized all the time.</li>
    <li> Automatic relief for your skin even if you don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that dry. I feel like even when I don&#x27;t wear makeup, it gives more life to my skin. Plus I love the sunscreen added in.</li>
    <li> This was a regrettable purchase.  The ingredients are supposed to enable you to have a physical sunscreen, but the zinc and titanium inside clog my pores and gave me acne.  I then realized that I need to treat this as a foundation, and remove the moisturizer with a makeup remover.  Since I don&#x27;t wear makeup, this was too much hassle for me.  Final verdict: buy this product only if you use makeup remover on a daily basis, as you&#x27;ll need it.</li>
    <li> This is a light day time moisturizer that keeps my skin feeling great.</li>
    <li> Good value, good lotion.</li>
    <li> Been using this daily and I definitely am noticing softer, smoother skin. Great that it has sunscreen in it too!</li>
    <li> Going with this sunscreen I can go through several pros and very very little cons. Pro it smells very nice and not like the usual gag inducing smell of most low price sunscreens. Pro the texture isn&#x27;t oily and feels rather smooth on my skin.. I didn&#x27;t feel like I was preparing my face to be deep fried by the sun. Pro, more importantly is the stuff works doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out or irritate my skin.  There is a minor con, wish the bottle had a different method of delivery. I tend to get a little too much lotion when I squeeze. Oh and even though it does say all day, that means every three to four hours reapplying if you&#x27;re outside most of the time period. Honestly I was expecting to have to pop it on every hour. That I didn&#x27;t means I&#x27;m happy with this sunscreen.</li>
    <li> It is light which I need in a daily cream. I read about this in an Allure magazine as a top product. And it has spf so that&#x27;s good too!</li>
    <li> A must have for daily skin care.</li>
    <li> Perfect SPF moisturizer! Goes on nicely, no fragrance, and well-priced. Will be buying more of this in the future.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! When I can&#x27;t seem to catch up with the desert dryness I use this again and again...Love because no matter how much I use I never break out as with so many other moisturizers.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite moisturizer.  really love it for my face.  and so far it&#x27;s cheapest here on amazon.</li>
    <li> I really like the ways this lotion feels on my face. It&#x27;s very light and silky feeling, and I don&#x27;t get &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34; from the sunscreen in it.  I use to use the Clinique dramatically different moisturizing lotion, but when they changed the formulation, it just didn&#x27;t feel right anymore.  Like I was just &amp;#34;aware&amp;#34; of it being on my face now.  So I decided to try this because it had pretty good reviews and I really need to be using something that has at least some sort of SPF (which Clinque doesn&#x27;t).  To me, this feels the way the Clinque used to. And it&#x27;s WAY cheaper!  There&#x27;s apparently a reason Olay&#x27;s been around for so long: they know what they&#x27;re doing!</li>
    <li> Great daily moisturizer, no oily or greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Used this brand for more than 20 years.  My skin is clear and looks great!</li>
    <li> My face breaks out in dry patches each time I used this product.  I finally had to disregard it.  I would not recommend.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> This is a nice basic moisturizer.  If you have super dry skin, this is not for you.  It is also nice because you get the sunscreen as well.</li>
    <li> love it.  Fast delivery</li>
    <li> This stuff burns my eye fast. I like the original much better.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone. I use it, every day, as a moisturizer, under my makeup. The SPF 15 keeps my face protected in the sun. Great product</li>
    <li> I was looking for a lotion with SPF that I could use on my face. This is very greasy and also made me break out. The smell is comparable to sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Love this, and the price is great.  My Dr. recommended it, love the sun screen in the product, will order again.</li>
    <li> I use Olay Complete on my face in the morning and at night before bed. It makes my face feel so soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Oil of Olay is the best.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for more years than I care to acknowledge, lets just say it was before the millennium...it&#x27;s not greasy and I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles.  I would not be without this product.  You can buy all that expensive garbage with alluring names or just use this.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I love Olay products. This is one of my favorites. Leaves my skin nicely moisturized without being oily. Doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out either!</li>
    <li> I like this moisturizer.  It&#x27;s light &amp; doesn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy.  I will probably switch to something a little heavier in the winter, but this is great for summer.  I like that it has SPF &amp; wouldn&#x27;t use a moisturizer that didn&#x27;t contain it.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen moisturizer.  It&#x27;s great for everyday use.  It&#x27;s not sticky or greasy like other sunscreens.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best skin lotion I&#x27;ve tried. Other skin lotions - especially with ESF - make my skin oily and really shiney. But Oil of Oley isn&#x27;t like this. After a long day, my skin still feels smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife. She was, of course, grateful for the product. However, she slowly started shifting back to her Aveeno. I should have never made the switch because she really prefers Aveeno.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Item as expected. Good packing. Only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the fact that I had to sign for this package, and had to go to the post office to pick it up!</li>
    <li> I have used this moisturizer on and off for many years.  I love how light it is, how easy to apply, the non-greasiness, the very light smell and the spf.  It is an old classic, and a good one.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice that this contains chemical sunscreen before I ordered it. I won&#x27;t be using it.</li>
    <li> I use this lotion everyday for my face - it&#x27;s great. I personally do not need too much lotion as my face is neither too oily or dry. I find this lotion offers the perfect hydration after a daily face wash. Living in a sunny climate, I appreciate the complete protection from the sun.</li>
    <li> olay has definitely the best skin care products, i have tried many brands in the past and always return to olay.</li>
    <li> Use this Product for Years, Never Disappointed!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  Love it!  I have sensitive skin and have to be careful what types of moisturizers I use on my face.  Oil of Olay has always been the safe choice for me.  I love their line of products.  This moisturizer was not heavy and didn&#x27;t break me out.  I use it when I work outside all day and it protects my fair skin from the sun.  Highly recommend this to women with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The bottle is not the most attractive, and the lotion tends to come out very quickly, but the lotion itself is great. It leaves skin soft and moisturized but does not leave a greasy feeling. The SPF is a nice perk too.</li>
    <li> I have used this for 25 yrs and it works ! Even better Ordered it from Amazon and no need to go to the store ! Also, not  expensive and works. Some anti aging products are outrageous and I get complimented  that I look 10 yrs younger. No Kidding !  I am 44 and look 32 according to others . Why buy $100 dollar items that either don&#x27;t work or do the same. By Oil of Olay!</li>
    <li> Nice, lightweight moisturizer with SPF for sensitive skin. My face is more oily to combination and this is one of the few moisturizers that does not make my face more oily. The one gripe I have with it is the lid that you have to screw on and off every time you use it. I would much prefer a top that lifted up, but it&#x27;s not a huge issue.</li>
    <li> So far so good! I&#x27;m happy with the results. My skin is not really oily since I&#x27;ve used this. Like this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and will never change. It&#x27;s light and non-greasy, which makes applying foundation afterwards a breeze.</li>
    <li> I like it, but I wish the sunscreen was a higher spf. I see there is another Olay moisturizer with 30 SPF, so I will purchase that one next.</li>
    <li> I have oil to combination skin. This one is good for dairy use. light. The only thing is it doesn&#x27;t have  the classical smell of olay which make me think of my mum.  My mum only use olay for so many years. I use olay simply because I miss my mum. Anyway， this is a good one.</li>
    <li> Have used this for most of my 74 years!  Skin still soft, not greasy.  Have some wrinkles, but guess I can blame the Olay for those!</li>
    <li> HG face moisturizer. its the only kind i can use that wont break me out with repeated use. wish the spf were higher. i only use the classic formula with zinc.</li>
</ol>
