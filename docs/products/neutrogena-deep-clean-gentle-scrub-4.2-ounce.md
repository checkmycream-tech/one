      <li>It feels refreshing.  </li>
      <li>Remover one is so much better wish I ordered that one.</li>

      <li>This has a nice gentle scrub.</li>
      <li>I was hoping this scrub would be more appropriate for &amp;#34;combination&amp;#34; skin; it works great for oily areas but dried out the rest of my face.</li>
      <li>Original review below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it made my face feel clean</li>
      <li>I started using this and 1 week later CLEAR BEAUTIFUL SKIN!!</li>
      <li>I use this once a day in the night to help get all my pores clean from the day.</li>
      <li>This has a nice light scent and makes my face really soft.</li>
      <li>Finding products that clean my face</li>
      <li>Smell is ok, but Clean &amp; Clear Morning Burst is a bit more exciting.</li>
      <li>Each time I use the scrub, my skin feels really clean and fresh.  </li>
      <li>I love exfoliation, I exfoliate daily in some way shape or form and this is one of the better exfoliants I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>The only thing I enjoy smelling more first thing in the morning is my coffee. :)</li>
      <li>very much~!^</li>
      <li>I decided to switch to much more \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; cleansers designed for normal skin instead of oily skin.</li>
      <li>It has a very mild scent, which I much prefer to a lot of products that are too perfume-y.</li>
      <li>I use this facial scrub every day in the shower, LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>I have combination/sensitive skin (the kind that flakes or looks red)</li>
      <li>The beads could be smaller and more plentiful, but overall I think this is an excellent basic cleansing scrub.</li>
      <li>I have used far too many products on my face trying to control what blemishes do arise.</li>
      <li>With Deap Clean Gentle Scrub, my skin started clearing up almost right away.</li>
      <li>I have tried numerous scrubs, facial cleansers and this is by far the best one I have ever used!</li>
      <li>I have been using this oi-free deep clean gentle scrub for more than 10 years.</li>
      <li>This product keep my face fresh and clean and YOUNG.  </li>
      <li>gives you a deep clean and makes your skin SOOO smooth.</li>
      <li>First of all, It smells like St.</li>
      <li>(&amp;#62; ^_^ &amp;#60;)</li>
      <li>I used to use the deep clean invigorating facial scrub which was effective...</li>
      <li>This is gentle but will also keep my face soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a decrease in oil or a positive change in my acne.</li>
      <li>is pretty gently.</li>
      <li>i am very please with what it does, and it is not expensive either.</li>
      <li>The grains are fine and not aggressively coarse like St. Ives.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and Deep Clean Scrub is super gentle and non-irritating.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels very clean after using it, but not at all dry.  </li>
      <li>Great product to use every day or when you feel you need a little extra exfoliation.  </li>
      <li>I have combination skin, and this scrub softens and cleans and balances and leaves me with soft fresh skin.</li>
      <li>I like the smell and the gentle scrub of it.  </li>
      <li>So after I ran out of my gentle scrub I tried the invogorating foaming scrub.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s when I went on Amazon and bought the gentle scrub.</li>
      <li>&amp;#62;It was really great~!^^&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This cleanser is gentle yet cleans SO well.</li>
      <li>the gently scrub label lives up to its name and their faces are&lt;br /&gt;clearer</li>
      <li>I really recommend it.</li>
      <li>It really cleans your skin.  </li>
      <li>This facial soap feels very fresh and silky.</li>
      <li>Neutrogena Oil-Free Deep Clean Cream Cleanser, 7 Ounce]],</li>
      <li>Too drying for my sensitive skin and didnt seem to do very much for my complextion</li>
      <li>I have used many high end scrubs and this is one of the best and least expensive.  </li>
      <li>Your skin feels and looks better in less then a week.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it as my main face wash product.</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of Neutrogena Deep Clean Oil Free Face Wash, so when I had hard time finding my stand-by scrub, naturally I grabbed this.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product for both men and women and with this price its unbeatable.</li>
      <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;First, this is far better for your face than the other scrubs that might use walnut shell and the like.</li>
      <li>The little beads are effective but can probably use daily, I intend to use it a couple of times a week.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
      <li>I recommend to everyone, I can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t need very much so the tube will last quite a while.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and also suffer from severe eczema.</li>
      <li>and I got various compliments on my skin for the first time.</li>
      <li>I have pretty dry skin, and living in Colorado, I have to be careful what I use to clean my face.  </li>
      <li>It does leave my skin red for a little while after using, but I see the results and love how my skin looks and feels since using it.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and it leaves it with the same clean and refreshed feeling as the invigorating scrub.</li>
      <li>Also, I have really sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>So far no complaints.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and this product has not caused any irritation, but your results may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But after using Neutrogena Deep Clean Gentle Scrub, I felt less oily on my face.</li>
      <li>Switched to Neutrogena&#x27;s all natural product line - no microbeads.</li>
      <li>This scrub is gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t irritate your face but potent enough to scrub away dead skin and leave your complexion brighter and clearer.</li>
      <li>Sometimes I get bored and buy something else, but I always go right out and buy more of this scrub.</li>
      <li>I use this scrub every other day in the shower; on the other days I use the neutrogena microdermabrasion kit which is also a phenomenal product.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without my facial scrub.  </li>
      <li>This is really the only facial scrub for me.</li>
      <li>This scrub is basically the same thing except it has smaller beads and much gentler on the skin.</li>
      <li>I never have 100% clear skin for longer than a day, because a pimple always seems to appear and form by the next day.</li>
      <li>Although my skin (especially in the chin area) is slightly sensitive-</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and will break out with a lot of facial wash or scrub.</li>
      <li>I had a bone marrow transplant recently and as a result, have EXTREMELY sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I like it because it gets all the dead skin off and leaves my face feeling fresh.  </li>
      <li>After searching high and low I have finally found the only product that seems to work for me.</li>
      <li>The microbeads in this product will be far kinder to your face in the long run.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say for certain it&#x27;s the cleanser, but I have noticeably less acne using the product twice a week.</li>
      <li>I have started to trust Neutrogenas products more as of late due simply to reviews from others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> I have started to trust Neutrogenas products more as of late due simply to reviews from others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It is a gentle scrub that clean the skin from greasy and dead cells residues without irritating it.</li>
<li> Having had irritation problems with other scrubs, I was cautious to only use this on my forehead prior to using it on the rest of my skin.</li>
<li> well while also not tearing it to shreds are few and far between.  </li>
<li> I need something gentle yet tough enough since i get dry skin build up on my forehead.</li>
<li> but it made my skin very dry and tight after using it so I could only use it once or twice a week.</li>
<li> /&gt;Only a small amount is required per use, so I expect it to last a long time.</li>
<li> It goes deep down into your pores and takes the dirty stuff right out.</li>
<li> my skin was smoother, but when I moved to my chin a few days later my chin broke out slightly.</li>
<li> didn&#x27;t actually expected for it to arrive in just four days~!</li>
<li> other products are throught the roof and do nothing at all.</li>
<li> Use this every other night and lasts for about 4-5 months.</li>
<li> It smooths the skin without tearing it up or having harsh chemicals that dry out the skin.</li>
<li> As compared to other brands, the amount of scrub is less.  </li>
<li> This one has only 4.2 oz, as compared to others that are at least 5 oz.  </li>
<li> The Black head</li>
<li> /&gt;Skin type: oily, few lines, 20-something, slightly pigmented, semi-sensitive, acne prone</li>
<li> It freshens my face in the summer by scrubbing off the layers of sweaty dead skin and sun lotion, and it freshens my complexion in the winter by sloughing off the dead winter skin.</li>
<li> And, is not too harsh for winter.</li>
<li> Obviously, it is a bit on the expensive side, which knocked it down from 5 stars, but I guess that&#x27;s what happens when you want to buy stuff like this.</li>
<li> I tried to look past the horrid smell and give it a chance to help my skin.</li>
<li> My skin is oily and I&#x27;ve been struggling with really bad clogged pores and blackhead/whiteheads and occasional inflamed pimples  for as long as I can remember!</li>
<li> The smell was simply not worth the mediocre results.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m sorry to say that it was a big disappointment.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have really bad skin, but I do have oily skin and my skin is never completely clear.</li>
<li> First of all, this stuff smells absolutely disgusting!!!</li>
<li> Plus it&#x27;s not too harsh on my skin!!!!</li>
<li> Unfortunately, I had to give up on this scrub and throw the rest away.</li>
<li> Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
<li> On one side it does leave my skin softer but on the bad side I really hate the insane amount of microbeds that it has, they  are really hard to rinse out.</li>
<li> No longer use this product because it has plastic microbeads - bad for the environment.</li>
<li> Now I again have a lot of clogged pore and whiteheads that are SOOOO annoying :(</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this every day as a facial wash. Very good. I would recommend this for anyone looking for a good all purpose face wash.</li>
    <li> I love this product. First of all, It smells like St.Joseph&#x27;s Aspirin For Children. That&#x27;s an orange candy smell. It&#x27;s refreshing and delicious. \\&quot;Refreshing\\&quot; is the best word for this scrub. It freshens my face in the summer by scrubbing off the layers of sweaty dead skin and sun lotion, and it freshens my complexion in the winter by sloughing off the dead winter skin. I have combination skin, and this scrub softens and cleans and balances and leaves me with soft fresh skin. I LOVE THIS. Sometimes I get bored and buy something else, but I always go right out and buy more of this scrub. I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Smells great and feels great. Try it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, only recently started buying it from Amazon.  I have very sensitive skin and Deep Clean Scrub is super gentle and non-irritating.  It smooths the skin without tearing it up or having harsh chemicals that dry out the skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about two years now and people keep telling me that my skin looks great. I have combination/sensitive skin (the kind that flakes or looks red) so take it from me, THIS WILL DO YOU NO HARM. I haven&#x27;t used makeup in months! LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Great price.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Neutrogena Deep Clean Oil Free Face Wash, so when I had hard time finding my stand-by scrub, naturally I grabbed this. Having had irritation problems with other scrubs, I was cautious to only use this on my forehead prior to using it on the rest of my skin. After using this on my forehead my skin was smoother, but when I moved to my chin a few days later my chin broke out slightly. Although my skin (especially in the chin area) is slightly sensitive-I haven&#x27;t had friction induced acne in years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a white cream with micro-beads in the formula. The package claims these beads are Beta Hydroxy, but after reading the ingredients I cannot figure out what they are. This has a nice fresh scent-citrus but not girly. This has salicylic acid in it-so it does have an acne fighting component.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product and hope my skin can build up tolerance to it, because the areas on my face that did not break out look very nice and are smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin type: oily, few lines, 20-something, slightly pigmented, semi-sensitive, acne prone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients I got off the package: water, sodium methyl cocyl taurate, polyethylene, glycerin, cocomidopropyl, betaine, glycol distearate, stearic acid, acrylates/c10-30 alkyl acylate crosspolymer, linoleanidopropyl, PG-dimonium chloride phosphate, neopentyl glycol dicoprlate/dicoporate, salicylcic acid, disodium edta, xanthan gum, magnesium aluminium silicate, sodium hydroxide, cetyl alcohol, phenoxyethanol, mathylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, putylparaben, agar, mica, titanium dioxide, iron oxide, red 20 lake, fragrance.</li>
    <li> I have pretty dry skin, and living in Colorado, I have to be careful what I use to clean my face.  Also, I have really sensitive skin.  This was a perfect product for me! My skin feels very clean after using it, but not at all dry.  I like the smell and the gentle scrub of it.  I also like that it is available with the subscribe and save.  This is a great feature for products that I tend to forget to re-order until I have run out!</li>
    <li> First of all, this stuff smells absolutely disgusting!!! I tried to look past the horrid smell and give it a chance to help my skin. I&#x27;m sorry to say that it was a big disappointment. I didn&#x27;t notice a decrease in oil or a positive change in my acne. Unfortunately, I had to give up on this scrub and throw the rest away. The smell was simply not worth the mediocre results. I&#x27;m now using St. Ives Apricot Scrub for oily/acne prone skin and I&#x27;m very satisfied with it...it&#x27;s cheaper, too!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without my facial scrub.  This product keep my face fresh and clean and YOUNG.  Now my teenage daughter uses it and loves it too!  The calendar says that I am 49, but you wouldn&#x27;t know it by looking at my skin, yes, you can say some of it is genetics.  I use this facial scrub every day in the shower, LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> After searching high and low I have finally found the only product that seems to work for me. I don&#x27;t have really bad skin, but I do have oily skin and my skin is never completely clear. I never have 100% clear skin for longer than a day, because a pimple always seems to appear and form by the next day. I bought affordable products that received multiple rave reviews but it always ended the same for me. With Deap Clean Gentle Scrub, my skin started clearing up almost right away. People noticed that my skin was clearing up and I got various compliments on my skin for the first time. This was the answer to my prayers. I also bought the invigorating foam scrub by neutrogena because it seemed to have very good reviews as well. So after I ran out of my gentle scrub I tried the invogorating foaming scrub. My skin was back to breaking out all over again. That&#x27;s when I went on Amazon and bought the gentle scrub. It arrived today and boy am I relieved. This is really the only facial scrub for me. It&#x27;s truly a life saver and for such an affordable price. I will never let you go, ever again.</li>
    <li> I used to use the deep clean invigorating facial scrub which was effective...it made my face feel clean but it made my skin very dry and tight after using it so I could only use it once or twice a week. This scrub is basically the same thing except it has smaller beads and much gentler on the skin. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and it leaves it with the same clean and refreshed feeling as the invigorating scrub. I use this scrub every other day in the shower; on the other days I use the neutrogena microdermabrasion kit which is also a phenomenal product.</li>
    <li> I love exfoliation, I exfoliate daily in some way shape or form and this is one of the better exfoliants I&#x27;ve used. It does leave my skin red for a little while after using, but I see the results and love how my skin looks and feels since using it.</li>
    <li> This product is a good face scrub to have in your skin care regimen. I wouldn&#x27;t use it as my main face wash product. But it has a great smell, it smells like an orange dreamsicle and the scrub is pretty gently.</li>
    <li> &amp;#62;It was really great~!^^&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t actually expected for it to arrive in just four days~! Better than I&#x27;ve thought~!^^&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much~!^ (&amp;#62; ^_^ &amp;#60;)</li>
    <li> Really great gentle scrub.mit has been compared to Arbonne at a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this product. On one side it does leave my skin softer but on the bad side I really hate the insane amount of microbeds that it has, they  are really hard to rinse out.</li>
    <li> This facial soap feels very fresh and silky. It has a pleasant scent.. The beads could be smaller and more plentiful, but overall I think this is an excellent basic cleansing scrub.</li>
    <li> not as espected, I thought it was the one with salicilyc acid.  does not work on my face.</li>
    <li> works good. i love neutrogena though and have used neutrogena stuff for a while now. i am very please with what it does, and it is not expensive either. other products are throught the roof and do nothing at all.</li>
    <li> This product works just as it says. Your skin feels and looks better in less then a week. I would recomend this product.</li>
    <li> very pleased really excellent product I can recommend it met my expectations so well that I was really very happy thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this scrub for years. I have sensitive skin and will break out with a lot of facial wash or scrub. I need something gentle yet tough enough since i get dry skin build up on my forehead. This is gentle but will also keep my face soft and smooth. I recommend to everyone, I can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
    <li> Both my boyfriend and I use this face scrub and love it. One of the reasons he uses it is because it does not smell feminine, it has a neutral odor to it. Its a white, creamy like scrub. I use it in the shower on my face and neck before I wash my face with the cleanser in the morning. I like it because it gets all the dead skin off and leaves my face feeling fresh.  My boyfriend says it helps with ingrown hairs on his face.  I highly recommend this product for both men and women and with this price its unbeatable.</li>
    <li> I have used many high end scrubs and this is one of the best and least expensive.  Each time I use the scrub, my skin feels really clean and fresh.  Makeup goes on better too.  Will buy again.  Don&#x27;t need very much so the tube will last quite a while.</li>
    <li> As compared to other brands, the amount of scrub is less.  This one has only 4.2 oz, as compared to others that are at least 5 oz.  Feels oily, even though states \\&quot;Oil-free\\&quot;.  Smell is ok, but Clean &amp; Clear Morning Burst is a bit more exciting.</li>
    <li> I have used far too many products on my face trying to control what blemishes do arise. I have started to trust Neutrogenas products more as of late due simply to reviews from others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, this is far better for your face than the other scrubs that might use walnut shell and the like. The microbeads in this product will be far kinder to your face in the long run. Second, this does have a hydroxy compound in it; this is often recommended by dermatologists in place of using salycylic acid products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does not burn and I use it almost daily in the morning. I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Amazon priced this perfectly - identical to in-store. No driving and no shipping cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deep clean name refers more to the cream as it contains slightly more astringent to give that &amp;#34;taught and clean&amp;#34; feeling. The grains are fine and not aggressively coarse like St. Ives.  Use this every other night and lasts for about 4-5 months.</li>
    <li> I was using this product for 2 years until a year ago, and in those 2 years my skin looked the BEST it has ever been in my life. This cleanser is gentle yet cleans SO well. It goes deep down into your pores and takes the dirty stuff right out. My skin is oily and I&#x27;ve been struggling with really bad clogged pores and blackhead/whiteheads and occasional inflamed pimples  for as long as I can remember! All those problems were gone when I was using this product. But about a year ago I decided to switch around and see what else is out there. I decided to switch to much more \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; cleansers designed for normal skin instead of oily skin. And my face has been going downhills ever since...Now I again have a lot of clogged pore and whiteheads that are SOOOO annoying :( I&#x27;m gonna switch back to this product tonight and hopefully it will salvage my face like it once did!</li>
    <li> This has a nice gentle scrub. Nice smell, a bit citrusy. The little beads are effective but can probably use daily, I intend to use it a couple of times a week. So far no complaints.</li>
    <li> The scrub does well on my two teenagers and doesn&#x27;t appear to be too&lt;br /&gt;harsh- the gently scrub label lives up to its name and their faces are&lt;br /&gt;clearer</li>
    <li> It is a gentle scrub that clean the skin from greasy and dead cells residues without irritating it. I really recommend it.</li>
    <li> does not help cleaning my pores</li>
    <li> ok so i used to use this all the time when i was a teenager and had GORG skin with maybe one pimple every so often. Everyone used to compliment me on how beautiful my skin was. Then i stopped and idk why i ever did . Im 25 now and started to break out, out of no where! tried alot of cleansers but still oily skin and break outs. dr put me on birth control ortho tri cyclon lo and my break outs reduced ALOT but still some. I started using this and 1 week later CLEAR BEAUTIFUL SKIN!! gives you a deep clean and makes your skin SOOO smooth. Won&#x27;t stop using this anymore . I learned my lesson.</li>
    <li> Update: One year later, my acne has reduced. I can&#x27;t say for certain it&#x27;s the cleanser, but I have noticeably less acne using the product twice a week. Original review below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product hoping the extra scrubbing power of the beads would reduce or eliminate facial acne. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me. However, the scrub does make my face feel smoother, so I will continue using it for that. The product has a pleasing fruit scent that doesn&#x27;t persist after it is washed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned, if you haven&#x27;t used a scrub before, it does feel like you are rubbing sand on your face. I have sensitive skin and this product has not caused any irritation, but your results may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only a small amount is required per use, so I expect it to last a long time. Good value.</li>
    <li> I have been using this oi-free deep clean gentle scrub for more than 10 years. There is no question about it: I LOVE it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was worried about my oily skin type. But after using Neutrogena Deep Clean Gentle Scrub, I felt less oily on my face. I recommend this cleanser very strongly to everyone who are worried about her oily skin.</li>
    <li> Too drying for my sensitive skin and didnt seem to do very much for my complextion</li>
    <li> I use this once a day in the night to help get all my pores clean from the day. This has a nice light scent and makes my face really soft. I recommend this scrub.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous scrubs, facial cleansers and this is by far the best one I have ever used! I have very sensitive skin and also suffer from severe eczema. This product has cleared up my face a great deal and not once has irritated my eczema. This is perfect for anyone suffering from eczema or really sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I use this facial scrub in conjunction with [[ASIN:B000052ZB5 Neutrogena Oil-Free Deep Clean Cream Cleanser, 7 Ounce]], and I have to say, these two products make quite the knock-out combo. This scrub is gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t irritate your face but potent enough to scrub away dead skin and leave your complexion brighter and clearer. I also adore the smell of it -- kind of a fresh, orangey scent. The only thing I enjoy smelling more first thing in the morning is my coffee. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> this product was amazing!!! :) I recommend this to everyone with skin like mine (OILY). I&#x27;m 13 and LOVE this! Plus it&#x27;s not too harsh on my skin!!!!</li>
    <li> This line from neutrogena is great.  It feels refreshing.  It really cleans your skin.  And, is not too harsh for winter.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this scrub would be more appropriate for &amp;#34;combination&amp;#34; skin; it works great for oily areas but dried out the rest of my face. It has a very mild scent, which I much prefer to a lot of products that are too perfume-y. I will continue using it in the &amp;#34;T zone&amp;#34; but will have to use something else for the rest of my face...</li>
    <li> It is watery! The Black head Remover one is so much better wish I ordered that one.</li>
    <li> I had a bone marrow transplant recently and as a result, have EXTREMELY sensitive skin.  Finding products that clean my face well while also not tearing it to shreds are few and far between.  Obviously, it is a bit on the expensive side, which knocked it down from 5 stars, but I guess that&#x27;s what happens when you want to buy stuff like this.</li>
    <li> No longer use this product because it has plastic microbeads - bad for the environment. Switched to Neutrogena&#x27;s all natural product line - no microbeads. Like the Naturals Purifying Pore Scrub even better!</li>
    <li> Great product to use every day or when you feel you need a little extra exfoliation.  My teenagers like it, as do I.</li>
