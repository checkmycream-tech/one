      <li>I shave my head, and love these!  </li>
      <li>My husband has tried many razors and this is the one he loves!</li>
      <li>My favorite disposable razors!</li>
      <li>I love it!  </li>
      <li>Edge suggests you wash your face first, apply their shaving gel (which is the best I&#x27;ve ever used), let the lather sit on your beard for three minutes to soften the beard and then shave...Against The Grain!  </li>
      <li>This razor slides smoothly over my odd-shaped, bump ridden, but attractive head....</li>
      <li>This razor is amazing.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t recommend using any razor without some kind</li>
      <li>Nice close shave and it lasts.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not saying these are the best ever,but they work very well for me on my face and head.</li>
      <li>Excellent all-around disposable razor....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s effective.</li>
      <li>Nice item for the price.</li>
      <li>These razors have some kind of brace from the handle to the head of the razor, so you can&#x27;t just run it under water and rinse it out.</li>
      <li>they shave nice and close without injury.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend the use of this kind of razors.</li>
      <li>Provides nice close shaves without skin irritation.</li>
      <li>just found my favorite razor,THE SCHICK XTREME DISPOABLE RAZOR,will be ordering more !.</li>
      <li>Also: You won&#x27;t find a better price anywhere online than Amazon.com for this (and many) product!</li>
      <li>Gives me a good shave, has a lubricating edge that works fine for me .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have ordered these before, and for guys with sensitive skin, they are the best!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be glad to give you an honest review.</li>
      <li>Totally worth it- a great razor.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an excellent razor for sensitive skin and the Edge Shave Gel &#x27;against the grain&#x27; instructions</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an excellent razor for sensitive skin and the Edge Shave Gel &#x27;against the grain&#x27; instructions</li>
      <li>These are BY FAR the best razors I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re good if you don&#x27;t shave against the grain, but if you want a clean shave you have to shave against the grain...</li>
      <li>Quick and easy purchase and a great value.</li>
      <li>Very comfortable.</li>
      <li>Have the metal handled nice schick extreme 3, you can pry these off the disposable handle and they fit perfectly on the good handle at a fraction of the cost of cartridges.</li>
      <li>I always go over the area I am shaving twice just to be sure</li>
      <li>So you get more area shaved with one razor than two or three of some others.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>couldn&#x27;t ask for a better razor.  </li>
      <li>so I am sure to have them on hand when  need them:)</li>
      <li>On top of that, I started to get nicks and cuts.</li>
      <li>ever since i started shaving - i am 49 and have never been satisfied with shaving.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what flavor it is, however I want some more.</li>
      <li>Hopefully, I will be pleased with whatever type I buy.</li>
      <li>so I would have to buy razors more often.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These razors have a better plastic protector they call &#x27;blade cover wings&#x27; that stay on these razors after they get tossed in my shaving kit keeping them truly protected.  </li>
      <li>Okay, I like them too.</li>
      <li>Could not be used more than 2 times.</li>
      <li>I have found these and love them https://www.harrys.com</li>
      <li>These are better than the Schick ST2.</li>
      <li>i love them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really love this product.</li>
      <li>Changing my review, I&#x27;ve grown to like these a lot more.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;much more feminine.</li>
      <li>The latest being the Bic Flex 4.  </li>
      <li>I use them about three or four times before tossing them, but I use them on my head and my beard since my hair on the top of my head is getting thinner by the day.  </li>
      <li>They offer the closest shave I&#x27;ve had on the top of my noggin since I&#x27;ve been shaving my noggin(about two years).  </li>
      <li>So, I&#x27;d recommend it more for shaving your head than your beard if you&#x27;re a tender, rugged man like myself, heh,</li>
      <li>For my beard, I&#x27;m still on the lookout for a better blade.</li>
      <li>I love these.  </li>
      <li>These are great and give a very close shave.  </li>
      <li>Ok if you shave every day, but then it becomes pricey and fills landfills.</li>
      <li>The most helpful review was written in 2010 when this was the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; product.</li>
      <li>This razor has a better feel than the cartridge version, which is heavier and</li>
      <li>So many baldies go with the Mach 3...</li>
      <li>The next best razor!</li>
      <li>The blade actually bends like paper and cuts great!</li>
      <li>so that was even more of a surpize.  </li>
      <li>Will oder more as needed.</li>
      <li>I have been using Xtreme razors for many years.</li>
      <li>need a couple of months more trial</li>
      <li>If any company out there thinks they have a better razor for shaving your head</li>
      <li>the head pivots better on my knees without getting cut.</li>
      <li>and i get more in a box.</li>
      <li>anything more than a triple blade</li>
      <li>I love these razors.</li>
      <li>My husband has used these for years and has always been pleased.  </li>
      <li>Love it.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
      <li>I love these razors.  </li>
      <li>We buy the 8 count pkg from Amazon as most of the stores we shop don&#x27;t carry that amount size.</li>
      <li>These are my fav shavers and I have tried so many.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite razor to date.</li>
      <li>both of which I bought at Amazon for a better price than I found elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the D/E razors and twin blade cartridges, you don&#x27;t have to do a 3 - or - 4 way shave with a triple blade razor.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s almost heresy to me:)  </li>
      <li>I get about 7 - 8 shaves per razor which costs me about 0.17 cents a shave at Amazon&#x27;s great price and that&#x27;s good enough for me.  </li>
      <li>I get about 7 - 8 shaves per razor which costs me about 0.17 cents a shave at Amazon&#x27;s great price and that&#x27;s good enough for me.  </li>
      <li>great quality, i have better luck with the schick&#x27;s not rusting as fast as bic and gillette.  </li>
      <li>I kept using it for a duration of more than 2 months ( usage at intervals of 3 days).</li>
      <li>I love it but do not know where to purchase it until I found it in Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>Love these blades for shaving my head they take form to curves</li>
      <li>What more can I ask?</li>
      <li>personal preference is the aloe vera coated blades, but any variety is wonderful.</li>
      <li>I love these.</li>
      <li>I love these blades.</li>
      <li>Nice , smooth and close shave.  </li>
      <li>Lasted more than one shave like most others.&lt;br /&gt;Did</li>
      <li>They stay comfortable for 4-5 uses this way, with no skin irritation!</li>
      <li>i love the flexible blades for shaving my legs and armpits.  </li>
      <li>I love the Schick Xtreme triple blade razors.  </li>
      <li>Used to love these disposables...</li>
      <li>a good price for these razors and quick secure ship.</li>
      <li>like these for traveling or the gym ,  very light and easy to handle .</li>
      <li>These work pretty good for close shaves.  </li>
      <li>As a girl,  these work pretty good.</li>
      <li>The price was pretty good compared to others.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been on a year long search for the \\&quot;Perfect Razor\\&quot; to shave with</li>
      <li>one razor is pretty good.</li>
      <li>The handle breaks easily and often it takes more than one for my husband to shave just 1 time.</li>
      <li>Of course with a heavy beard or more frequently shaving, I would not be able to use it for 6-8 months but for me, this has been the best and the most durable razor ever experienced.</li>
      <li>/&gt;i shave my head and face about every 3-4 days and a safety razor is more comfortable esp.</li>
      <li>am able to get a smooth shave and haven&#x27;t cut myself once by forcing to the curve of my head.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>These are great if you have sensitive skin, they 3 blades and flexible head help prevent against irritation.</li>
      <li>just kidding, as cheap plastic razors go, these are OK.</li>
      <li>For others like me that also use a shaving brush and shaving soap; this razor works great with my Proraso shaving soap for sensitive skin and my tweezerman&#x27;s shaving brush;</li>
      <li>Nice sized package and worth the cost.  </li>
      <li>Unless you keep it dry, these arent very good for more than maybe 2 uses.</li>
      <li>Very smooth and good for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Blades that don&#x27;t clog and rinse easily?</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t be purchasing these again and here is why; They clog easily.</li>
      <li>Just trimming to keep the beard clean mostly.</li>
      <li>You get the entire razor at a much better price and both my face &amp; wallet are happy.</li>
      <li>I get nicked easily.  </li>
      <li>These are a fair trade off and a decent price.  </li>
      <li>Hands down the best razors fro shaving my legs.</li>
      <li>I just find it works easier over all parts of the face and does a fine job.  </li>
      <li>Works fine.  </li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve tried every razor imaginable from disposable to mail-order to changeable blades to electric and this is by far the best razor for shaving your head due to the fact the blades are very flexible and when you get to the rounded part of the head which most people&#x27;s heads around the blade contours perfectly without putting that much pressure on it.</li>
      <li>It really is the most perfect razor I&#x27;ve ever shaved with; better than it&#x27;s brothers the Hydro&#x27;s, the Quattro and the Schick ST2 (which I&#x27;m passionate about my ST2&#x27;s) and the Quattro is darned hard to beat...but the Extreme3 is as close to a perfect razor I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
      <li>Also, they rinse clean pretty easily and if you are tempted they can be used again with pretty good results.  </li>
      <li>These work best for my heavy beard.</li>
      <li>and I get a smooth shave.</li>
      <li>They either bruise my face or don&#x27;t cut close enough but these work great every time.</li>
      <li>Received my Schick Xtreme razor free in the Sunday paper.  </li>
      <li>Close comfortable shave.  </li>
      <li>Great razor for the price, last lobger than the cheaper store dispoable razors, been using them for years.</li>
      <li>Never cuts and ultra smooth for a 3 bladed razor</li>
      <li>but for the one or two uses they are fantastic and cheap razors.</li>
      <li>The Schick Xtreme 3 glides smoothly across my face against the grain, weather</li>
      <li>The Schick Xtreme 3 glides smoothly across my face against the grain, weather</li>
      <li>Fortunately, I found these razors.</li>
      <li>Received one for free with a shave cream or else I would not have known about them</li>
      <li>Shave is not even, nor smooth.</li>
      <li>It was the equivalent of buying two packs and getting one free.  </li>
      <li>The shaving is smooth and have no irritation on my scalp.</li>
      <li>We were glad to see them offered on Amazon at a good price and have the bonus of them being shipped at regular intervals.</li>
      <li>handle is comfortable and the blades are easy to clean with a quick jet of water.</li>
      <li>smooth clean shave.</li>
      <li>The way the razor flexes allows me to shave my head (which I do every three days) quickly and easy with no cuts.</li>
      <li>The Schick Xtreme 3 Triple Blade does a great job and has a long service life.</li>
      <li>worth a try !</li>
      <li>I have tried disposables in the past and these are the best.</li>
      <li>They wear out sooner, don&#x27;t give as clean a shave, and feel cheaper.</li>
      <li>The shave is clean and long-lasting</li>
      <li>It provide a clean shave that lasted for 3 days.</li>
      <li>It is smooth, shaves close, and quickly.  </li>
      <li>The blade is pretty good and lasts for about a week of normal use.</li>
      <li>UPDATE: Still using the Extreme3 Sensitive Desposable and just Love this Razor!</li>
      <li>I wear a nicely beard and love Schick Xtreme dispo razors for keeping a well-groomed appearance -- and these offer a comfortable shave even when used dry (as I do).  </li>
      <li>this razor is very good, but it does seem to wear out faster than most of the other triples I&#x27;ve used...not a huge deal, but it seems a bit like a built in design flaw to wear out early...</li>
      <li>Also has a nice moisturizing strip to allow the blade to slide gently across your most sensitive</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth it and makes a huge difference.</li>
      <li>recently i took the plunge to a safety razor and they are superior.  </li>
      <li>They are also among the most reasonably priced as well.</li>
      <li>oh yeah, disposable razors are cool....</li>
      <li>but it was good enough.</li>
      <li>gives me a perfect pain free shave with a once over instead of going over my face several times or doing multiple touch ups.  </li>
      <li>gives me a perfect pain free shave with a once over instead of going over my face several times or doing multiple touch ups.  </li>
      <li>I have been using these for several years and they go beyond my expectations for a durable razor and a good, close shave.  </li>
      <li>these have  held up nicely and my daughter can use on her sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I bought a whole bunch of them, and I will throw them out as soon as I buy some more Mach 3.</li>
      <li>and these razors hold up well through the process.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike some disposables they don&#x27;t wear out as quickly as others.  </li>
      <li>They give an exceptionally close shave and can be used several times before discarding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You could say I&#x27;m a dedicated loyal customer now.</li>
      <li>I get an incredibly close shave and have so far been using the same razor for a month.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It used to be the best and last the longest but in recent years has gone downhill.&lt;br</li>
      <li>10x longer, are more comfortable, clean WAY easier, and stay sharp 10x better than any generics I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I first discovered these when they gave them away for free with the Skintimate shave gels.</li>
      <li>These were pretty gentle and still did a pretty nice job on the close shave.</li>
      <li>I typically used Gillette brand products, these Schick are great.</li>
      <li>His skin is very sensitive, so most razors cause nicks, cuts, scrapes and rashes.</li>
      <li>they are not available here in singapore; so i have to \\&quot;fly them in\\&quot; from the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This gives me a very close shave and its quite smooth over your skin.</li>
      <li>Naturally, I researched all over again and tried everything (Sensor, Sensor Excel, Mach III, Mach III Turbo, Fusion, etc, etc) and this razor still comes out on top.  </li>
      <li>I use these on my most sensitive parts.</li>
      <li>and they just feel like they are pulling the hair out and not cutting.</li>
      <li>are worth it..</li>
      <li>It seems, however, that recently Schick decided to change their design to a more &amp;#34;cost effective&amp;#34; one - i.e. Xtreme-ly cheap.</li>
      <li>The old handle had a rounded indent at the top of the shaver which made holding and maneuvering the shaver a breeze.</li>
      <li>They were far better than any I have ever used before - or since.</li>
      <li>I need a good razor that stays sharp and cleans well.</li>
      <li>I work overseas and can&#x27;t get a razor in shops to cut just right.</li>
      <li>Three blades seem to be the right mix of price and performance.</li>
      <li>Cheap and decent blades.</li>
      <li>This particular razor gives a baby smooth cut and the head pivots</li>
      <li>The blades are sharp and it&#x27;s easy to clean, its easy rinse feature prevents blades from clogging.</li>
      <li>Apparently the steel used or the process has changed in manufacturing so they can sell more product and as a result you now have an inferior product compared to it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;predecessor.</li>
      <li>, I had to go looking for this particular razor, because this is the only one I&#x27;ve used that leaves my legs nick free and very smooth.</li>
      <li>They are wonderful in that they stay sharp for a very long time and don&#x27;t nick your skin.  </li>
      <li>but the new design resulted in a lighter weight, cheap razor that no longer works at all how it did before.  </li>
      <li>Inexpensive, effective, and for a disposable razor, lasted a very long time.</li>
      <li>I believe I have gotten a bit cleaner shaves from Gilette, but this is good enough for the price, so I can recommend them with a clear conscience.</li>
      <li>No wonder because these are easy on sensitive skin</li>
      <li>/&gt;Spend the $$ in the first place to buy decent razors and be done with it!!</li>
      <li>I tried to clean it out really well, and I was fairly successful with a bunch of effort, but the razor still loses its edge after about 8 shaves.</li>
      <li>Even at major discount retailers you&#x27;d pay a whole more.</li>
      <li>No exaggeration; I had 5 cuts the first time using one of these Schick disposables.  </li>
      <li>shave the first two times</li>
      <li>I may be able to use it for the next 4-8 weeks anyway.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t even go into how many different brands of razors I&#x27;ve tried over the 30+years of shaving.</li>
      <li>That first freebie lasted close to six months with no irritation or cuts to speak of.</li>
      <li>At the first glance, i relied on the actual price discount it shows.&lt;br /&gt;Product came in real quick</li>
      <li>/&gt;Later when i went to Sam&#x27;s club, i could figured out that this purchase was 50% higher the price/</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also purchased these in a pretty mauve which is so</li>
      <li>some of the generic ones are better in regard to longevity...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll buy more next time I need them.</li>
      <li>My husband use to shave twice a day and has found this razor can get closer the first time.</li>
      <li>So every three days I shave my entire head and the top and bottom of my beard.</li>
      <li>You may want a tad higher quality for your face though.</li>
      <li>At first, I was not going to use them.</li>
      <li>I will not be getting generics anymore and would highly recommend these blades!!</li>
      <li>They cost the same on Amazon as they do in the store but Amazon Prime is much more convenient.</li>
      <li>They are not perfect, but they are disposable razors and are not supposed to be perfect.</li>
      <li>product even has a satisfaction guarantee - but companies know that most consumers will not jump through all the hoops necessary to receive their money back.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Although Gillette and other brands have good quality blades, the prices they charge are way too high for razor blades</li>
      <li>Good shave, clean and low drag.  </li>
      <li>heh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, it&#x27;s a pretty good razor that definitely has my vote when considering my scalp.  </li>
      <li>blades stay nice and sharp for about two-three shaves.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fine razor and runs very smoothly over your face, but when I go back to the Xtreme, it&#x27;s like coming back to an old familiar friend.  </li>
      <li>Trust me, I shopped at my local chain drug store, as well as a division of the &amp;#34;Dollar&amp;#34; store systems, and they are priced more reasonable here on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Because of it, I tried a few other triple blades, but this is the best.  </li>
      <li>I love these for travel, but they are good enough to use for a week at least if you wanted.</li>
      <li>If you have anything more than a few days of stubble, these razors will clog with the hair and you can&#x27;t wash it clean in a basin or under the tap like with others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with these razors and will continue to purchase them in the future.</li>
      <li>I will continue to buy this razor for as long as Amazon has it at such a good price.</li>
      <li>Both Gillette and Schick seem to do a good job and last a long time.</li>
      <li>But I never had a single razor work for me for more than 3 months before this one.</li>
      <li>Too many cuts and limited blade life.</li>
      <li>For the rest, both flexible, disposable, ergonomic, easy to handle models are similar as they pivot for a closer shaving, and make skin softer than ever thanks to Aloe and vitamin E.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Price is very important to me but watching the shaving cream turn pink with blood oozing through my pores with the D/E blades and the pain afterward...</li>
      <li>Price is very important to me but watching the shaving cream turn pink with blood oozing through my pores with the D/E blades and the pain afterward...</li>
      <li>It is good that these come in a pack of 8 because it took me several to get through a single shave.  </li>
      <li>Plus, they aren&#x27;t very rough on my dry skin, which is another great plus.</li>
      <li>I got one free, either by mail or with my paper (probably the latter).</li>
      <li>Yes, it&#x27;s stainless steel, but even so it does deteriorate in the presence of moisture.</li>
      <li>Really like these disposable razors.  </li>
      <li>They give you a really close shave with no nicks.</li>
      <li>The moisture bar on the razor is a bit much for me, but not a problem given I wash my face after shaving.</li>
      <li>Very close shave and affordable.</li>
      <li>I have a light beard, have been using these Schick Xtreme 3 Triple Blade razors for several years, get them automatically annually from Amazon.</li>
      <li>Shave very well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They were sharper to begin with and would stay sharper much longer.</li>
      <li>0.17 cents is cheap enough.  </li>
      <li>0.17 cents is cheap enough.  </li>
      <li>The price is reasonable for this item</li>
      <li>Cheapest and easiest way to shave, thanks to Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Have used tis Schick razor for some time now ... works real well for me and the price is reasonable.  </li>
      <li>These work very well.</li>
      <li>spend the extra bucks for a cartridge-or ,even better, and old school safety razor.</li>
      <li>the new ones are a more true green, like a forest-green.  </li>
      <li>For a disposable razor it works OK plus at a good price, seemed to last no more than ten days before needing disposal.</li>
      <li>I have a pretty heavy beard, use it every day, and each shaver will last me for about 3 weeks; so for me, they are a good bang for the buck; even tho</li>
      <li>Better than other disposable razors that I have used.</li>
      <li>Comparable to most other disposable razors.</li>
      <li>Also stays sharp for many shaves.</li>
      <li>I really like the Schick razors in that they bend to curve around the face (in particular the chin area).  </li>
      <li>Everyone who needs a clean and lasting shave should try using it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m someone who doesn&#x27;t want to pay too much for razor blades and want something that has decent quality.</li>
      <li>Because the head is limited to 3 blades I can easily shave the under-nose-above mustache area.  </li>
      <li>I personally get a good week and a half of shaves out of each one .</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using these razors for as long as they have been available.  </li>
      <li>The Schick Xtreme 3 gives me a smooth, close shave with no stubble but also with no razor burn and no nicks or cuts as long as I practice the shaving technique recommended by Edge Shave Gel; which I also have purchased from Amazon.com.  </li>
      <li>these are exactly what they say they are: Schick Xtreme 3 sensitive razors.</li>
      <li>They barely last two full shaves.</li>
      <li>exactly as described, even came early.</li>
      <li>I shave about twice a week, these are better than average disposable razors.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;ve never nicked me, ever—and I can get pretty wild with a blade.</li>
      <li>So i get a better shave, they cost less than the woman styles</li>
      <li>This razor works as well or better than more expensive razors.</li>
      <li>When we got home, my husband wanted me to find this particular razor.  </li>
      <li>and I think they may be even better than the more expensive razors.</li>
      <li>I decided that I was going to use these up as soon as possible, so that I could get back to my favorite razor.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>We recommend it highly if one is looking for a reliable disposable razor.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these razors.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure why there&#x27;s so many positive reviews.</li>
      <li>They are very smooth, dont cut my skin in anyway, no nics at all, no razor burn, and last a long time.  </li>
      <li>It looks like the &#x27;improvements&#x27; in razor technology is little more than marketing.</li>
      <li>Get my neck, head, and face VERY smooth and last a long time without dulling too!</li>
      <li>awesome bad move from whatever suit decided the product needed a change.</li>
      <li>First, the obvious, these are much cheaper than purchasing the replacement heads for the 5+ razor systems.</li>
      <li>He shaves his head and face everyday and loves these more then any designer razor that I seem to try to buy him.</li>
      <li>Razor is OK and lasts for a few shave.</li>
      <li>They flex just the right amount in the middle for the contours of your head.</li>
      <li>They last for about 3-4 weeks with regular use and the great thing is they don&#x27;t pull or tug your facial hair when you&#x27;re shaving and has minimal razor burn.</li>
      <li>After two weeks it is still like new.</li>
      <li>I just shaved the day before I purchased them and wanted to try something new.</li>
      <li>I will not be buying these again, as I have found a New razor, that works.</li>
      <li>These new razors now result in cuts and nicks from the simplest shaving passes.</li>
      <li>Now to find a new brand of razors...</li>
      <li>This \\&quot;new and improved\\</li>
      <li>Today I took out a new razor and I could not even shave my beard one time.</li>
      <li>I have a new pack of Fusion refills waiting to go, but I&#x27;m in no hurry to toss the Schick away.</li>
      <li>&quot; you press down on the top, you will see that the blade is very flexible and it also tilts back and forth.</li>
      <li>Schick Xtreme 3 Triple Blades are above average and do a good job of clearing stubble on first pass, although a second pass in the opposite direction often enhances smoothness.</li>
      <li>I have a rough beard but disposable razors should be good for a few shaves.</li>
      <li>I have very very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>My husband has very sensitive skin and these razors</li>
      <li>It does seem it is the exact same triple&lt;br /&gt;blade</li>
      <li>Bought theme at a local store and went home to shave with them for the first time</li>
      <li>Next, performance, for me these perform even better than some of the more expensive razors.</li>
      <li>Read the other *RECENT* reviews, not the most helpful.</li>
      <li>Not only do their triple blades make them better then other disposable razors, but their design makes them easier to use then the Mach III.  </li>
      <li>(A couple years ago, I stopped using &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; razors after I discovered how higher quality blade refills could be cared for and last for weeks or months.)</li>
      <li>These used to be my favorite razor, but the last time I ordered I received a much cheaper darker green version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>FortunatelyI have three of the old handles that I reuse with with new blades.</li>
      <li>They get my face smooth with less irritation then my electric razor used to.  </li>
      <li>I &#x27;d rather have to pay less and get the same close shave than to pay more and keep running out.</li>
      <li>I think that Schick really makes the best razor and blades plus they are less expensive than Big G. End of line.</li>
      <li>I visited a super market and purchased these extreme 3 razors.</li>
      <li>The old ones were a sort-of blue-green color.  </li>
      <li>The new&amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; design doesn&#x27;t work like the old one.</li>
      <li>Schick Xtreme3 Sensitive, Women, 8-Count</li>
      <li>They provide an even closer shave and leave your skin extremely soft.</li>
      <li>I bought this and Schick ST2 Disposable Razor Sensitive for Men, 12 Count.</li>
      <li>I shave with lotion because my legs are highly sensitive to razor</li>
      <li>but for whatever reason, these sensitive razors do a number on my skin.</li>
      <li>And there is no razor rash with the Aloe for Sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Halfway through shaving, I grabbed another razor to complete the shave.  </li>
      <li>Boy, was I surprised when this thing kept going and going.</li>
      <li>By the way, if you want these blades to last a while, rinse them clean (don&#x27;t rub), blow them out with air, and let them dry naturally.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything from straight razors to disposables to electrics and back again.</li>
      <li>My old ones did not feal like that or even close after</li>
      <li>I like using them with Taylor of Old Bond Street tub shaving creams (Avocado and Eton College are my favorites).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 26 year old woman</li>
      <li>These last forever, erase stubble, and gently do what they promise.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been purchasing generic 3-blade disposable razors for a few years (because I thought they were a better value) and decided to get the name brand this time.</li>
      <li>short, Schick finally got it right, eliminating the need to line Gillette&#x27;s pockets.</li>
      <li>These are no-where as good as the 4 blade ones I used for 10+ years, I haven&#x27;t cut myself shaving in years with those and cut myself the first time using this razor as it seemed rough, not smooth as it went over my skin - I will revert back to my other 4 blade brand</li>
      <li>I really like the more expensive blades, but constantly paying so much for them</li>
      <li>My beard is not very heavy</li>
      <li>Just dry the blades right after using and these razors will last ages!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I ever had.&lt;br /&gt;I grabbed a new one at the gym a while back, and the thing ran for a month of p/t shaving !!</li>
      <li>Generally something as small as a razor is not that important to write a review about.</li>
      <li>well not as sharp as the first day</li>
      <li>I am in different to the redesign, but I did figure out that you can transplant the entire new blade hokder onto the old handles.  </li>
      <li>Target still had a few packs of the original style when I went over the weekend, but they too were starting to filter in the junkier version.</li>
      <li>since they generally keep me from suffering major blood loss.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve previously tried all the other top brands, they suffer this same problem.</li>
      <li>Not to have to change for nearly 1/2 a year is terrific.</li>
      <li>I switched to an electric razor 7 years ago because I could never find a razor that worked with my sensitive skin (can you say red bumps).  </li>
      <li>my skin is extra sensitive, but I give the usage of this product 3 stars.</li>
      <li>people read the recent reviews instead of buying the product based on a review written almost five years ago when it was the old product.</li>
      <li>67 years old, recently retired and was a mechanical engineer.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve finally found it in the Schick Xtreme 3 Triple Blade Sensitive.  </li>
      <li>if the blade lasted longer than 2 weeks against my not heavy female leg hair I would give it 5 stars but 2 weeks with</li>
      <li>mean, it is important not to bleed to death in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Much easier on the skin than other disposables.</li>
      <li>Even when I decided to suffer the cheap plastic the razor nicks and cuts from the first use ( I tried three different ones from the pack!)...very sad considering the use to last for weeks.</li>
      <li>Not a good or comfortable shave.</li>
      <li>Hard to clean, short use period</li>
      <li>My husband has been using the Schick Xtreme 3 Triple Blade Closeness Razors for Sensitive skin for as long as it has been on the market.</li>
      <li>And, surprise, they don&#x27;t last nearly as long as the old version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>female version is 5 star (I&#x27;d give it 10 if I could), and worth the small extra cost.</li>
      <li>I cut myself twice, and feel like a 17 year old suicide victim.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried every other new hotness thinking it&#x27;d work...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if that’s good or bad for a &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; but the other guys are good for at least a month.</li>
      <li>and I bought them online because I live VERY remotely.</li>

<li> My favorite razors!</li>
<li> I shave my head, and love these!  </li>
<li> My husband has tried many razors and this is the one he loves!</li>
<li> My favorite disposable razors!</li>
<li> I love it!  </li>
<li> Edge suggests you wash your face first, apply their shaving gel (which is the best I&#x27;ve ever used), let the lather sit on your beard for three minutes to soften the beard and then shave...Against The Grain!  </li>
<li> This razor slides smoothly over my odd-shaped, bump ridden, but attractive head....</li>
<li> This razor is amazing.</li>
<li> don&#x27;t recommend using any razor without some kind</li>
<li> Nice close shave and it lasts.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not saying these are the best ever,but they work very well for me on my face and head.</li>
<li> Excellent all-around disposable razor....</li>
<li> It&#x27;s effective.</li>
<li> Nice item for the price.</li>
<li> These razors have some kind of brace from the handle to the head of the razor, so you can&#x27;t just run it under water and rinse it out.</li>
<li> they shave nice and close without injury.  </li>
<li> I would recommend the use of this kind of razors.</li>
<li> Provides nice close shaves without skin irritation.</li>

<li> I have ordered these before, and for guys with sensitive skin, they are the best!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll be glad to give you an honest review.</li>
<li> Totally worth it- a great razor.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s an excellent razor for sensitive skin and the Edge Shave Gel &#x27;against the grain&#x27; instructions</li>
<li> It&#x27;s an excellent razor for sensitive skin and the Edge Shave Gel &#x27;against the grain&#x27; instructions</li>
<li> These are BY FAR the best razors I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
<li> They&#x27;re good if you don&#x27;t shave against the grain, but if you want a clean shave you have to shave against the grain...</li>
<li> Quick and easy purchase and a great value.</li>
<li> Very comfortable.</li>
<li> Have the metal handled nice schick extreme 3, you can pry these off the disposable handle and they fit perfectly on the good handle at a fraction of the cost of cartridges.</li>
<li> I always go over the area I am shaving twice just to be sure</li>
<li> So you get more area shaved with one razor than two or three of some others.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> couldn&#x27;t ask for a better razor.  </li>
<li> so I am sure to have them on hand when  need them:)</li>
<li> On top of that, I started to get nicks and cuts.</li>
<li> ever since i started shaving - i am 49 and have never been satisfied with shaving.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know what flavor it is, however I want some more.</li>
<li> Hopefully, I will be pleased with whatever type I buy.</li>
<li> so I would have to buy razors more often.</li>
<li> /&gt;These razors have a better plastic protector they call &#x27;blade cover wings&#x27; that stay on these razors after they get tossed in my shaving kit keeping them truly protected.  </li>
<li> Okay, I like them too.</li>
<li> Could not be used more than 2 times.</li>
<li> I have found these and love them https://www.harrys.com</li>
<li> These are better than the Schick ST2.</li>
<li> i love them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I really love this product.</li>
<li> Changing my review, I&#x27;ve grown to like these a lot more.  </li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;much more feminine.</li>
<li> The latest being the Bic Flex 4.  </li>
<li> I use them about three or four times before tossing them, but I use them on my head and my beard since my hair on the top of my head is getting thinner by the day.  </li>
<li> They offer the closest shave I&#x27;ve had on the top of my noggin since I&#x27;ve been shaving my noggin(about two years).  </li>
<li> So, I&#x27;d recommend it more for shaving your head than your beard if you&#x27;re a tender, rugged man like myself, heh,</li>
<li> For my beard, I&#x27;m still on the lookout for a better blade.</li>
<li> I love these.  </li>
<li> These are great and give a very close shave.  </li>
<li> Ok if you shave every day, but then it becomes pricey and fills landfills.</li>
<li> The most helpful review was written in 2010 when this was the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; product.</li>
<li> This razor has a better feel than the cartridge version, which is heavier and</li>
<li> So many baldies go with the Mach 3...</li>
<li> The next best razor!</li>
<li> The blade actually bends like paper and cuts great!</li>
<li> so that was even more of a surpize.  </li>
<li> Will oder more as needed.</li>
<li> I have been using Xtreme razors for many years.</li>
<li> need a couple of months more trial</li>
<li> If any company out there thinks they have a better razor for shaving your head</li>
<li> the head pivots better on my knees without getting cut.</li>
<li> and i get more in a box.</li>
<li> anything more than a triple blade</li>
<li> I love these razors.</li>
<li> My husband has used these for years and has always been pleased.  </li>
<li> Love it.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
<li> I love these razors.  </li>
<li> We buy the 8 count pkg from Amazon as most of the stores we shop don&#x27;t carry that amount size.</li>
<li> These are my fav shavers and I have tried so many.</li>
<li> This is my favorite razor to date.</li>
<li> both of which I bought at Amazon for a better price than I found elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the D/E razors and twin blade cartridges, you don&#x27;t have to do a 3 - or - 4 way shave with a triple blade razor.  </li>
<li> That&#x27;s almost heresy to me:)  </li>
<li> I get about 7 - 8 shaves per razor which costs me about 0.17 cents a shave at Amazon&#x27;s great price and that&#x27;s good enough for me.  </li>
<li> I get about 7 - 8 shaves per razor which costs me about 0.17 cents a shave at Amazon&#x27;s great price and that&#x27;s good enough for me.  </li>
<li> great quality, i have better luck with the schick&#x27;s not rusting as fast as bic and gillette.  </li>
<li> I kept using it for a duration of more than 2 months ( usage at intervals of 3 days).</li>
<li> I love it but do not know where to purchase it until I found it in Amazon.com.</li>
<li> Love these blades for shaving my head they take form to curves</li>
<li> What more can I ask?</li>
<li> personal preference is the aloe vera coated blades, but any variety is wonderful.</li>
<li> I love these.</li>
<li> I love these blades.</li>
<li> Nice , smooth and close shave.  </li>
<li> Lasted more than one shave like most others.&lt;br /&gt;Did</li>
<li> They stay comfortable for 4-5 uses this way, with no skin irritation!</li>
<li> i love the flexible blades for shaving my legs and armpits.  </li>
<li> I love the Schick Xtreme triple blade razors.  </li>
<li> Used to love these disposables...</li>
<li> a good price for these razors and quick secure ship.</li>
<li> like these for traveling or the gym ,  very light and easy to handle .</li>
<li> These work pretty good for close shaves.  </li>
<li> As a girl,  these work pretty good.</li>
<li> The price was pretty good compared to others.</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been on a year long search for the \\&quot;Perfect Razor\\&quot; to shave with</li>
<li> one razor is pretty good.</li>
<li> The handle breaks easily and often it takes more than one for my husband to shave just 1 time.</li>
<li> Of course with a heavy beard or more frequently shaving, I would not be able to use it for 6-8 months but for me, this has been the best and the most durable razor ever experienced.</li>
<li> /&gt;i shave my head and face about every 3-4 days and a safety razor is more comfortable esp.</li>
<li> am able to get a smooth shave and haven&#x27;t cut myself once by forcing to the curve of my head.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> These are great if you have sensitive skin, they 3 blades and flexible head help prevent against irritation.</li>
<li> just kidding, as cheap plastic razors go, these are OK.</li>
<li> For others like me that also use a shaving brush and shaving soap; this razor works great with my Proraso shaving soap for sensitive skin and my tweezerman&#x27;s shaving brush;</li>
<li> Nice sized package and worth the cost.  </li>
<li> Unless you keep it dry, these arent very good for more than maybe 2 uses.</li>
<li> Very smooth and good for sensitive skin.</li>
<li> /&gt;Blades that don&#x27;t clog and rinse easily?</li>
<li> I won&#x27;t be purchasing these again and here is why; They clog easily.</li>
<li> Just trimming to keep the beard clean mostly.</li>
<li> You get the entire razor at a much better price and both my face &amp; wallet are happy.</li>
<li> I get nicked easily.  </li>
<li> These are a fair trade off and a decent price.  </li>
<li> Hands down the best razors fro shaving my legs.</li>
<li> I just find it works easier over all parts of the face and does a fine job.  </li>
<li> Works fine.  </li>
<li> i&#x27;ve tried every razor imaginable from disposable to mail-order to changeable blades to electric and this is by far the best razor for shaving your head due to the fact the blades are very flexible and when you get to the rounded part of the head which most people&#x27;s heads around the blade contours perfectly without putting that much pressure on it.</li>
<li> It really is the most perfect razor I&#x27;ve ever shaved with; better than it&#x27;s brothers the Hydro&#x27;s, the Quattro and the Schick ST2 (which I&#x27;m passionate about my ST2&#x27;s) and the Quattro is darned hard to beat...but the Extreme3 is as close to a perfect razor I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
<li> Also, they rinse clean pretty easily and if you are tempted they can be used again with pretty good results.  </li>
<li> These work best for my heavy beard.</li>
<li> and I get a smooth shave.</li>
<li> They either bruise my face or don&#x27;t cut close enough but these work great every time.</li>
<li> Received my Schick Xtreme razor free in the Sunday paper.  </li>
<li> Close comfortable shave.  </li>
<li> Great razor for the price, last lobger than the cheaper store dispoable razors, been using them for years.</li>
<li> Never cuts and ultra smooth for a 3 bladed razor</li>
<li> but for the one or two uses they are fantastic and cheap razors.</li>
<li> The Schick Xtreme 3 glides smoothly across my face against the grain, weather</li>
<li> The Schick Xtreme 3 glides smoothly across my face against the grain, weather</li>
<li> Fortunately, I found these razors.</li>
<li> Received one for free with a shave cream or else I would not have known about them</li>
<li> Shave is not even, nor smooth.</li>
<li> It was the equivalent of buying two packs and getting one free.  </li>
<li> The shaving is smooth and have no irritation on my scalp.</li>
<li> We were glad to see them offered on Amazon at a good price and have the bonus of them being shipped at regular intervals.</li>
<li> handle is comfortable and the blades are easy to clean with a quick jet of water.</li>
<li> smooth clean shave.</li>
<li> The way the razor flexes allows me to shave my head (which I do every three days) quickly and easy with no cuts.</li>
<li> The Schick Xtreme 3 Triple Blade does a great job and has a long service life.</li>
<li> worth a try !</li>
<li> I have tried disposables in the past and these are the best.</li>
<li> They wear out sooner, don&#x27;t give as clean a shave, and feel cheaper.</li>
<li> The shave is clean and long-lasting</li>
<li> It provide a clean shave that lasted for 3 days.</li>
<li> It is smooth, shaves close, and quickly.  </li>
<li> The blade is pretty good and lasts for about a week of normal use.</li>
<li> UPDATE: Still using the Extreme3 Sensitive Desposable and just Love this Razor!</li>
<li> I wear a nicely beard and love Schick Xtreme dispo razors for keeping a well-groomed appearance -- and these offer a comfortable shave even when used dry (as I do).  </li>
<li> this razor is very good, but it does seem to wear out faster than most of the other triples I&#x27;ve used...not a huge deal, but it seems a bit like a built in design flaw to wear out early...</li>
<li> Also has a nice moisturizing strip to allow the blade to slide gently across your most sensitive</li>
<li> It&#x27;s definitely worth it and makes a huge difference.</li>
<li> recently i took the plunge to a safety razor and they are superior.  </li>
<li> They are also among the most reasonably priced as well.</li>
<li> oh yeah, disposable razors are cool....</li>
<li> but it was good enough.</li>
<li> gives me a perfect pain free shave with a once over instead of going over my face several times or doing multiple touch ups.  </li>
<li> gives me a perfect pain free shave with a once over instead of going over my face several times or doing multiple touch ups.  </li>
<li> I have been using these for several years and they go beyond my expectations for a durable razor and a good, close shave.  </li>
<li> these have  held up nicely and my daughter can use on her sensitive skin</li>
<li> I bought a whole bunch of them, and I will throw them out as soon as I buy some more Mach 3.</li>
<li> and these razors hold up well through the process.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike some disposables they don&#x27;t wear out as quickly as others.  </li>
<li> They give an exceptionally close shave and can be used several times before discarding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> You could say I&#x27;m a dedicated loyal customer now.</li>
<li> I get an incredibly close shave and have so far been using the same razor for a month.</li>
<li> /&gt;It used to be the best and last the longest but in recent years has gone downhill.&lt;br</li>
<li> 10x longer, are more comfortable, clean WAY easier, and stay sharp 10x better than any generics I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
<li> I first discovered these when they gave them away for free with the Skintimate shave gels.</li>
<li> These were pretty gentle and still did a pretty nice job on the close shave.</li>
<li> I typically used Gillette brand products, these Schick are great.</li>
<li> His skin is very sensitive, so most razors cause nicks, cuts, scrapes and rashes.</li>
<li> they are not available here in singapore; so i have to \\&quot;fly them in\\&quot; from the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> This gives me a very close shave and its quite smooth over your skin.</li>
<li> Naturally, I researched all over again and tried everything (Sensor, Sensor Excel, Mach III, Mach III Turbo, Fusion, etc, etc) and this razor still comes out on top.  </li>
<li> I use these on my most sensitive parts.</li>
<li> and they just feel like they are pulling the hair out and not cutting.</li>
<li> are worth it..</li>
<li> It seems, however, that recently Schick decided to change their design to a more &amp;#34;cost effective&amp;#34; one - i.e. Xtreme-ly cheap.</li>
<li> The old handle had a rounded indent at the top of the shaver which made holding and maneuvering the shaver a breeze.</li>
<li> They were far better than any I have ever used before - or since.</li>
<li> I need a good razor that stays sharp and cleans well.</li>
<li> I work overseas and can&#x27;t get a razor in shops to cut just right.</li>
<li> Three blades seem to be the right mix of price and performance.</li>
<li> Cheap and decent blades.</li>
<li> This particular razor gives a baby smooth cut and the head pivots</li>
<li> The blades are sharp and it&#x27;s easy to clean, its easy rinse feature prevents blades from clogging.</li>
<li> Apparently the steel used or the process has changed in manufacturing so they can sell more product and as a result you now have an inferior product compared to it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;predecessor.</li>
<li> , I had to go looking for this particular razor, because this is the only one I&#x27;ve used that leaves my legs nick free and very smooth.</li>
<li> They are wonderful in that they stay sharp for a very long time and don&#x27;t nick your skin.  </li>
<li> but the new design resulted in a lighter weight, cheap razor that no longer works at all how it did before.  </li>
<li> Inexpensive, effective, and for a disposable razor, lasted a very long time.</li>
<li> I believe I have gotten a bit cleaner shaves from Gilette, but this is good enough for the price, so I can recommend them with a clear conscience.</li>
<li> No wonder because these are easy on sensitive skin</li>
<li> /&gt;Spend the $$ in the first place to buy decent razors and be done with it!!</li>
<li> I tried to clean it out really well, and I was fairly successful with a bunch of effort, but the razor still loses its edge after about 8 shaves.</li>
<li> Even at major discount retailers you&#x27;d pay a whole more.</li>
<li> No exaggeration; I had 5 cuts the first time using one of these Schick disposables.  </li>
<li> shave the first two times</li>
<li> I may be able to use it for the next 4-8 weeks anyway.</li>
<li> I won&#x27;t even go into how many different brands of razors I&#x27;ve tried over the 30+years of shaving.</li>
<li> That first freebie lasted close to six months with no irritation or cuts to speak of.</li>
<li> At the first glance, i relied on the actual price discount it shows.&lt;br /&gt;Product came in real quick</li>
<li> /&gt;Later when i went to Sam&#x27;s club, i could figured out that this purchase was 50% higher the price/</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also purchased these in a pretty mauve which is so</li>
<li> some of the generic ones are better in regard to longevity...</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll buy more next time I need them.</li>
<li> My husband use to shave twice a day and has found this razor can get closer the first time.</li>
<li> So every three days I shave my entire head and the top and bottom of my beard.</li>
<li> You may want a tad higher quality for your face though.</li>
<li> At first, I was not going to use them.</li>
<li> I will not be getting generics anymore and would highly recommend these blades!!</li>
<li> They cost the same on Amazon as they do in the store but Amazon Prime is much more convenient.</li>
<li> They are not perfect, but they are disposable razors and are not supposed to be perfect.</li>
<li> product even has a satisfaction guarantee - but companies know that most consumers will not jump through all the hoops necessary to receive their money back.&lt;br</li>
<li> Although Gillette and other brands have good quality blades, the prices they charge are way too high for razor blades</li>
<li> Good shave, clean and low drag.  </li>
<li> heh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, it&#x27;s a pretty good razor that definitely has my vote when considering my scalp.  </li>
<li> blades stay nice and sharp for about two-three shaves.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a fine razor and runs very smoothly over your face, but when I go back to the Xtreme, it&#x27;s like coming back to an old familiar friend.  </li>
<li> Trust me, I shopped at my local chain drug store, as well as a division of the &amp;#34;Dollar&amp;#34; store systems, and they are priced more reasonable here on Amazon.  </li>
<li> Because of it, I tried a few other triple blades, but this is the best.  </li>
<li> I love these for travel, but they are good enough to use for a week at least if you wanted.</li>
<li> If you have anything more than a few days of stubble, these razors will clog with the hair and you can&#x27;t wash it clean in a basin or under the tap like with others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
<li> Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with these razors and will continue to purchase them in the future.</li>
<li> I will continue to buy this razor for as long as Amazon has it at such a good price.</li>
<li> Both Gillette and Schick seem to do a good job and last a long time.</li>
<li> But I never had a single razor work for me for more than 3 months before this one.</li>
<li> Too many cuts and limited blade life.</li>
<li> For the rest, both flexible, disposable, ergonomic, easy to handle models are similar as they pivot for a closer shaving, and make skin softer than ever thanks to Aloe and vitamin E.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
<li> Price is very important to me but watching the shaving cream turn pink with blood oozing through my pores with the D/E blades and the pain afterward...</li>
<li> Price is very important to me but watching the shaving cream turn pink with blood oozing through my pores with the D/E blades and the pain afterward...</li>
<li> It is good that these come in a pack of 8 because it took me several to get through a single shave.  </li>
<li> Plus, they aren&#x27;t very rough on my dry skin, which is another great plus.</li>
<li> I got one free, either by mail or with my paper (probably the latter).</li>
<li> Yes, it&#x27;s stainless steel, but even so it does deteriorate in the presence of moisture.</li>
<li> Really like these disposable razors.  </li>
<li> They give you a really close shave with no nicks.</li>
<li> The moisture bar on the razor is a bit much for me, but not a problem given I wash my face after shaving.</li>
<li> Very close shave and affordable.</li>
<li> I have a light beard, have been using these Schick Xtreme 3 Triple Blade razors for several years, get them automatically annually from Amazon.</li>
<li> Shave very well.</li>
<li> /&gt;They were sharper to begin with and would stay sharper much longer.</li>
<li> 0.17 cents is cheap enough.  </li>
<li> 0.17 cents is cheap enough.  </li>
<li> The price is reasonable for this item</li>
<li> Cheapest and easiest way to shave, thanks to Amazon.  </li>
<li> Have used tis Schick razor for some time now ... works real well for me and the price is reasonable.  </li>
<li> These work very well.</li>
<li> spend the extra bucks for a cartridge-or ,even better, and old school safety razor.</li>
<li> the new ones are a more true green, like a forest-green.  </li>
<li> For a disposable razor it works OK plus at a good price, seemed to last no more than ten days before needing disposal.</li>
<li> I have a pretty heavy beard, use it every day, and each shaver will last me for about 3 weeks; so for me, they are a good bang for the buck; even tho</li>
<li> Better than other disposable razors that I have used.</li>
<li> Comparable to most other disposable razors.</li>
<li> Also stays sharp for many shaves.</li>
<li> I really like the Schick razors in that they bend to curve around the face (in particular the chin area).  </li>
<li> Everyone who needs a clean and lasting shave should try using it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m someone who doesn&#x27;t want to pay too much for razor blades and want something that has decent quality.</li>
<li> Because the head is limited to 3 blades I can easily shave the under-nose-above mustache area.  </li>
<li> I personally get a good week and a half of shaves out of each one .</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using these razors for as long as they have been available.  </li>
<li> The Schick Xtreme 3 gives me a smooth, close shave with no stubble but also with no razor burn and no nicks or cuts as long as I practice the shaving technique recommended by Edge Shave Gel; which I also have purchased from Amazon.com.  </li>
<li> these are exactly what they say they are: Schick Xtreme 3 sensitive razors.</li>
<li> They barely last two full shaves.</li>
<li> exactly as described, even came early.</li>
<li> I shave about twice a week, these are better than average disposable razors.  </li>
<li> They&#x27;ve never nicked me, ever—and I can get pretty wild with a blade.</li>
<li> So i get a better shave, they cost less than the woman styles</li>
<li> This razor works as well or better than more expensive razors.</li>
<li> When we got home, my husband wanted me to find this particular razor.  </li>
<li> and I think they may be even better than the more expensive razors.</li>
<li> I decided that I was going to use these up as soon as possible, so that I could get back to my favorite razor.</li>
<li> I highly recommend it.</li>
<li> We recommend it highly if one is looking for a reliable disposable razor.</li>
<li> Highly recommend.</li>
<li> I highly recommend these razors.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure why there&#x27;s so many positive reviews.</li>
<li> They are very smooth, dont cut my skin in anyway, no nics at all, no razor burn, and last a long time.  </li>
<li> It looks like the &#x27;improvements&#x27; in razor technology is little more than marketing.</li>
<li> Get my neck, head, and face VERY smooth and last a long time without dulling too!</li>
<li> awesome bad move from whatever suit decided the product needed a change.</li>
<li> First, the obvious, these are much cheaper than purchasing the replacement heads for the 5+ razor systems.</li>
<li> He shaves his head and face everyday and loves these more then any designer razor that I seem to try to buy him.</li>
<li> Razor is OK and lasts for a few shave.</li>
<li> They flex just the right amount in the middle for the contours of your head.</li>
<li> They last for about 3-4 weeks with regular use and the great thing is they don&#x27;t pull or tug your facial hair when you&#x27;re shaving and has minimal razor burn.</li>
<li> After two weeks it is still like new.</li>
<li> I just shaved the day before I purchased them and wanted to try something new.</li>
<li> I will not be buying these again, as I have found a New razor, that works.</li>
<li> These new razors now result in cuts and nicks from the simplest shaving passes.</li>
<li> Now to find a new brand of razors...</li>
<li> This \\&quot;new and improved\\</li>
<li> Today I took out a new razor and I could not even shave my beard one time.</li>
<li> I have a new pack of Fusion refills waiting to go, but I&#x27;m in no hurry to toss the Schick away.</li>
<li> &quot; you press down on the top, you will see that the blade is very flexible and it also tilts back and forth.</li>
<li> Schick Xtreme 3 Triple Blades are above average and do a good job of clearing stubble on first pass, although a second pass in the opposite direction often enhances smoothness.</li>
<li> I have a rough beard but disposable razors should be good for a few shaves.</li>
<li> I have very very sensitive skin</li>
<li> My husband has very sensitive skin and these razors</li>
<li> It does seem it is the exact same triple&lt;br /&gt;blade</li>
<li> Bought theme at a local store and went home to shave with them for the first time</li>
<li> Next, performance, for me these perform even better than some of the more expensive razors.</li>
<li> Read the other *RECENT* reviews, not the most helpful.</li>
<li> Not only do their triple blades make them better then other disposable razors, but their design makes them easier to use then the Mach III.  </li>
<li> (A couple years ago, I stopped using &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; razors after I discovered how higher quality blade refills could be cared for and last for weeks or months.)</li>
<li> These used to be my favorite razor, but the last time I ordered I received a much cheaper darker green version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> FortunatelyI have three of the old handles that I reuse with with new blades.</li>
<li> They get my face smooth with less irritation then my electric razor used to.  </li>
<li> I &#x27;d rather have to pay less and get the same close shave than to pay more and keep running out.</li>
<li> I think that Schick really makes the best razor and blades plus they are less expensive than Big G. End of line.</li>
<li> I visited a super market and purchased these extreme 3 razors.</li>
<li> The old ones were a sort-of blue-green color.  </li>
<li> The new&amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; design doesn&#x27;t work like the old one.</li>
<li> Schick Xtreme3 Sensitive, Women, 8-Count</li>
<li> They provide an even closer shave and leave your skin extremely soft.</li>
<li> I bought this and Schick ST2 Disposable Razor Sensitive for Men, 12 Count.</li>
<li> I shave with lotion because my legs are highly sensitive to razor</li>
<li> but for whatever reason, these sensitive razors do a number on my skin.</li>
<li> And there is no razor rash with the Aloe for Sensitive skin.</li>
<li> Halfway through shaving, I grabbed another razor to complete the shave.  </li>
<li> Boy, was I surprised when this thing kept going and going.</li>
<li> By the way, if you want these blades to last a while, rinse them clean (don&#x27;t rub), blow them out with air, and let them dry naturally.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from straight razors to disposables to electrics and back again.</li>
<li> My old ones did not feal like that or even close after</li>
<li> I like using them with Taylor of Old Bond Street tub shaving creams (Avocado and Eton College are my favorites).</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a 26 year old woman</li>
<li> These last forever, erase stubble, and gently do what they promise.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing generic 3-blade disposable razors for a few years (because I thought they were a better value) and decided to get the name brand this time.</li>
<li> short, Schick finally got it right, eliminating the need to line Gillette&#x27;s pockets.</li>
<li> These are no-where as good as the 4 blade ones I used for 10+ years, I haven&#x27;t cut myself shaving in years with those and cut myself the first time using this razor as it seemed rough, not smooth as it went over my skin - I will revert back to my other 4 blade brand</li>
<li> I really like the more expensive blades, but constantly paying so much for them</li>
<li> My beard is not very heavy</li>
<li> Just dry the blades right after using and these razors will last ages!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I ever had.&lt;br /&gt;I grabbed a new one at the gym a while back, and the thing ran for a month of p/t shaving !!</li>
<li> Generally something as small as a razor is not that important to write a review about.</li>
<li> well not as sharp as the first day</li>
<li> I am in different to the redesign, but I did figure out that you can transplant the entire new blade hokder onto the old handles.  </li>
<li> Target still had a few packs of the original style when I went over the weekend, but they too were starting to filter in the junkier version.</li>
<li> since they generally keep me from suffering major blood loss.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve previously tried all the other top brands, they suffer this same problem.</li>
<li> Not to have to change for nearly 1/2 a year is terrific.</li>
<li> I switched to an electric razor 7 years ago because I could never find a razor that worked with my sensitive skin (can you say red bumps).  </li>
<li> my skin is extra sensitive, but I give the usage of this product 3 stars.</li>
<li> people read the recent reviews instead of buying the product based on a review written almost five years ago when it was the old product.</li>
<li> 67 years old, recently retired and was a mechanical engineer.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
<li> and I&#x27;ve finally found it in the Schick Xtreme 3 Triple Blade Sensitive.  </li>
<li> if the blade lasted longer than 2 weeks against my not heavy female leg hair I would give it 5 stars but 2 weeks with</li>
<li> mean, it is important not to bleed to death in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Much easier on the skin than other disposables.</li>
<li> Even when I decided to suffer the cheap plastic the razor nicks and cuts from the first use ( I tried three different ones from the pack!)...very sad considering the use to last for weeks.</li>
<li> Not a good or comfortable shave.</li>
<li> Hard to clean, short use period</li>
<li> My husband has been using the Schick Xtreme 3 Triple Blade Closeness Razors for Sensitive skin for as long as it has been on the market.</li>
<li> And, surprise, they don&#x27;t last nearly as long as the old version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> female version is 5 star (I&#x27;d give it 10 if I could), and worth the small extra cost.</li>
<li> I cut myself twice, and feel like a 17 year old suicide victim.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried every other new hotness thinking it&#x27;d work...</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if that’s good or bad for a &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; but the other guys are good for at least a month.</li>
<li> and I bought them online because I live VERY remotely.</li>
<li> the blades are much sharper than I expected and they last longer than the other brands I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br</li>
<li> My only complaint is that my neck is rather sensitive, and this particular razor doesn&#x27;t handle my neck so well.  </li>
<li> While tolerating a build up of clear plastic blade protectors from other disposable razors which always slid off and collected in the bottom my shaving kit I used to think that was another one of those planned obsolesce things</li>
<li> After several attempts and so-so experiences with other both high and low-end products from other companies, I just picked up a set of these Schick razors at a local store.</li>
<li> and they last long.</li>
<li> but they don&#x27;t last as long as I would like.</li>
<li> /&gt;These razors were a complete waste of my time, my money and what&#x27;s left of my facial skin after using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Plus I was very much annoyed that when I started shaving my hairs were getting stuck in the blades and full on stuck...</li>
<li> I just got sick of the constant compromise between a smooth close shave with raw throbbing face for 2 - 3 days or a comfortable shave and a face with patches of stubble.  </li>
<li> These razors didn&#x27;t cut or nick, and would last a very long time.  </li>
<li> The price is far less than the insanely-priced Gillette Fusion, which in my experience has some --</li>
<li> the shave it provides is close with minimal to no razor burn, even when going against the grain...also a plus is that the design makes it slightly more difficult to cut your ear</li>
<li> I ordered new ones and by looking at them they looked identical to the old ones other then the color and a small change in the handle part.  </li>
<li> So in short, their new razor is now no better than any of the others.  </li>
<li> They get the job done and for me (shaving every other day, don&#x27;t grow a ton of facial hair), they last a month or so.</li>
<li> not what I usually buy, but decent for the price.</li>
<li> With a medium/coarse beard and sensitive skin (that&#x27;s gotten worse as I get older)</li>
<li> A lot of these kinds of items are overpriced since people stuck working in remote locations often rely on places like Amazon to get basic needs to them.  </li>
<li> The center of the razor always has hair left in it.</li>
<li> Used these for a long time now</li>
<li> strange.</li>
<li> Schick Xtreme 3 Triple Blades are well made and last about as long as I expected.</li>
<li> /&gt;Amazon still has the older lighter green version pictured but i&#x27;m not willing to risk</li>
<li> (the high price helps these companies pay for naming rights to football stadiums, i.e. Gillette Stadium home of the NE Patriots, endorsements by Clay Matthews and Tiger Woods); sorry I would rather keep my money and use a decent blade rather than line the pockets of these celebrities.</li>
<li> Have tried bargain brand and even other name brands - they don&#x27;t last as long and/or result in nicks and cuts.</li>
<li> they get very dull very fast.</li>
<li> The flexible blades hug the melon well and last over a week of shaving head every other day/face every day.  </li>
<li> Plus, no more accidental ear lobe accidents, no more shaving off the top layer of skin, no more sneezing and become noseless again.</li>
<li> This product has proven itself in our household for a very long time.</li>
<li> Dry your razor immediately after use and keep it dry until you use it again.</li>
<li> I rinse thoroughly, tap off the clinging water on my sink, hug it in a dry towel and then remove from my humid bathroom.</li>
<li> Face doesn&#x27;t dry out and bladed</li>
<li> They are so dry that they stuck to my skin, even with using high-quality shaving cream.</li>
<li> After the shave, my skin turned out dry and irritated.</li>
<li> These blades last about a month for me, and I have a relatively heavy beard.&lt;br /&gt;The lubricant strip doesn&#x27;t last too long, but that&#x27;s not really an issue.&lt;br /&gt;Relatively close shave --</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve stopped shaving with the single edged razor of death and switched to these.</li>
<li> It ends up cutting and nicking more than any other razor I have used.</li>
<li> The replaceable blades on things like mach 3 are very expensive, but do not clog and therefore can be used longer and are a better value</li>
<li> shaving brushes and creams work too - you use less cream - considerably less and my brush is 10 yrs old - they last if you dry them upside down.</li>
<li> Works well, but quality vent down in recent year or so and price crept up.</li>
<li> After 44 years of shaving the idea of not taking the beard down in stages and starting against the grain...makes me wince in pain at the thought of it.</li>
<li> Even when I&#x27;m careful to dry off the blades after shaving.</li>
<li> I used to buy womans razors which are about double the price for half the blades.</li>
<li> Is pretty dull feeling by the end of the week and is very unforgiving on problem spots on your face...if the hair grows weird or whatever.</li>
<li> Have switched to other brands and it not near the comfort, closeness that I need.</li>
<li> Also, it&#x27;s easier to get in tight places like under your nose than those big bulky one.  </li>
<li> I have never had such a close shave as I get with this little guy.</li>
<li> Dulls after 1-2 shaves.</li>
<li> The shave is rough and to get a close shave</li>
<li> The razor head is wide, which provides stability and reduces shaving time&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
<li> I have used comparable Gillette razors and when the handle gets wet</li>
<li> If you have trouble with your neck, definitely try this.</li>
<li> Have tried a few that were suppose to be similar....</li>
<li> one razor last a few uses (stays sharp) if soaked in baby oil afterwards.</li>
<li> I have tried the new Gillette expensive variety which cost a lot of money and last no time at all and the so-called &#x27;razor&#x27; tug doesn&#x27;t occur with these either.</li>
<li> And to think, It&#x27;s crossed my mind several times in the past that I should stock up, because one day they&#x27;ll quite making these.  </li>
<li> Like some of the other reviews have noted, Shick have changed the design of this razor.</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t remember because it&#x27;s been almost 6 months and believe it or not I&#x27;ve been using it for that long exclusively to shave my fairly heavy beard.</li>
<li> It is still sharp...</li>
<li> I won&#x27;t buy any other razor.</li>
<li> I &#x27;ve tried other razors</li>
<li> the blades are realy sharp.</li>
<li> This was not happeninig with other blades .</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll admit that I probably go through them faster than my other razors.</li>
<li> However, I think that&#x27;s due to the fact that I no problem throwing these away when they&#x27;ve been used.</li>
<li> but at CVS and no doubt other retailers using a coupon or watching for a discount.&lt;br</li>
<li> and it is still sharp.</li>
<li> The quality of some of the razors recently shipped is not like the ones we got in months past.</li>
<li> don&#x27;t give him the after-shave burn or rash other razors do.</li>
<li> I would never use these, or any other brand , of throwaways.</li>
<li> I am a Schick extreme 3 guy.</li>
<li> I shave my head and face every other day.</li>
<li> I am not sure, if I can sent them back to Amazon, but will converse with Amazon about it.</li>
<li> I usually get no name double blade razors.  </li>
<li> I can even use them without shaving cream and the razor burn is very minimal.</li>
<li> Very sharp be careful</li>
<li> These last at least 5x to</li>
<li> I have medium thick facial hair</li>
<li> I also dry the razor off when finished (a wet razor will dull quicker) and each one lasts me 5-6 months.</li>
<li> Very sharp.</li>
<li> I decided to buy these in bulk at Sam&#x27;s Club considering they were about half the price point as the Gillete Mach 3.They feel about half the price point.</li>
<li> research it and see if its for you - you&#x27;ll save money and have less waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Just wish these were like $2-3 less.</li>
<li> Bought these blades previously in a store but now cannot find them so tried Amazon.  </li>
<li> I had previously used them.</li>
<li> The chance for nicks is much less than most&lt;</li>
<li> My experience with these razors has been less than favorable!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Typical disposable razor.  </li>
<li> These are dull razors and leaves hair behind even going over the same spot and different directions.</li>
<li> I wish there was a blade-only replacement system for less money (seems like less waste).</li>
<li> Because of this little innovation each razor lasts longer and that means I&#x27;m saving money.  </li>
<li> The fact that the blades flex a little bit gives me a closer shave than I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
<li> Put a little money into a higher-quality razor.</li>
<li> Uncomfortable, liable to cause occasional nicks</li>
<li> Now, as always, the manufacturer has decided that they need to reduce the quality to save a few pennies.  </li>
<li> They feel like the super-cheap razors in your hand, and they are not nearly as comfortable to use.  </li>
<li> on my neck  - this product and its brethren all have close blades that pull and rip heavy growth and they cut below the skin</li>
<li> and I usually shave twice or 3times a week as an average.</li>
<li> you get a lot of razor burn even with heavy shaving gel.</li>
<li> I would return them but its to much trouble.</li>
<li> i bought these to see if they were any cheaper than my gilette and while they are cheaper i am not sure the few pence</li>
<li> My face usually doesn&#x27;t get cut while shaving.</li>
<li> Usually when I use razors to shave my mustache it hurts but with these it didn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
<li> /&gt;For the first time i am disappointed at my Amazon purchase.</li>
<li> I finally decided to stop buying expensive razors and start buying these \\&quot;disposable\\&quot; razors.</li>
<li> Compared to the Mach 3s I usually use these suck.</li>
<li> This razor flexes excessively in places you do not want it to.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m sure they have a market somewhere, but for me, these are awful.</li>
<li> I have never had problems with them and usually get 5 or 6 shaves with them before they dull somewhat.  </li>
<li> about 6 or 7 shaves out of 1 razor before they get dull</li>
<li> but I don&#x27;t shave hard core.</li>
<li> The lubricating strip lasts 4-5 shaves, and I find the blade getting dull to the point of discomfort after 8-10 shaves.</li>
<li> razor seemed extremely dull to begin with.</li>
<li> I now only get two shaves out of these before they start cutting up my face.</li>
<li> Really not too expensive considering the price you pay at home for these things.  </li>
<li> The redesign hasn&#x27;t given me any negative reactions,  yet.</li>
<li> if you&#x27;re trying to shave your legs, you&#x27;ll need to go through at least two of these razors</li>
<li> I was stunned, to say the least.</li>
<li> The new design stinks!  </li>
<li> On occasion he will nick himself, but that is usually because he&#x27;s in a hurry!</li>
<li> Seriously, I started using the Schick December 26, 2009 and just retired it.</li>
<li> Using one of these razors to shave with was NOT a good shaving experience for</li>
<li> These razors are NOT good.</li>
<li> Sad Sad Sad that big business is shipping jobs over to China and they are allowed to say Made in USA when its made in China</li>
<li> So this just sucks!</li>
<li> Even though they are disposalble they are tough on leg hair.</li>
<li> I have a secret pack of these</li>
<li> I have never felt worse.</li>
<li> I hope the Public doesn&#x27;t allow SHICK to get away with this crap.</li>
<li> The newly designed ones (I think they released those in 2014), feel cheaper and cut terribly.</li>
<li> but i think alas those expensive trac 3</li>
<li> I was skeptical about the necessity of using 3 blades and was thinking of it as a solely marketing tactic.</li>
<li> I try to find something wrong with it and can not.</li>
<li> thought I had found the one - the search unfortunately has restarted.&lt;br</li>
<li> Well, I was disappointed to say the least.  </li>
<li> I shaved with one and it felt like I shaved with a very dull blade or blades and it was almost painful.  </li>
<li> The hair in the center leads to rusting, which leads to an awful shave.</li>
<li> Razor blade cartridges are crazy expensive.</li>
<li> - why are we cutting our skin ??</li>
<li> You definitely can&#x27;t go wrong in buying these!  </li>
<li> what a bad mistake</li>
<li> I shave every two days and have not had a bad shave yet.</li>
<li> These hurt so bad I didn&#x27;t even finish the package.</li>
<li> HATE</li>
<li> They are awful.</li>
<li> In my opinion, these are terrible razors.  </li>
<li> This is a horrible product.</li>
<li> Worst shave I can remember.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These were the best razors I have ever used.  These razors didn&#x27;t cut or nick, and would last a very long time.  Now, as always, the manufacturer has decided that they need to reduce the quality to save a few pennies.  And the result is junk.  The old ones were a sort-of blue-green color.  the new ones are a more true green, like a forest-green.  They feel like the super-cheap razors in your hand, and they are not nearly as comfortable to use.  And, surprise, they don&#x27;t last nearly as long as the old version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I guess I&#x27;m done with these razors.  And to think, It&#x27;s crossed my mind several times in the past that I should stock up, because one day they&#x27;ll quite making these.  And that day has come.</li>
    <li> I get a great shave with these razors.</li>
    <li> Like some of the other reviews have noted, Shick have changed the design of this razor. I now only get two shaves out of these before they start cutting up my face. This is what happens when companies &amp;#34;improve&amp;#34; designs to cut costs.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t buy again. The new&amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; design doesn&#x27;t work like the old one. I&#x27;m getting cuts every time I shave.&lt;br /&gt;Cannot recommend at all.</li>
    <li> I think that Schick really makes the best razor and blades plus they are less expensive than Big G. End of line.</li>
    <li> A lot of these kinds of items are overpriced since people stuck working in remote locations often rely on places like Amazon to get basic needs to them.  Really not too expensive considering the price you pay at home for these things.  Happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> My face usually doesn&#x27;t get cut while shaving. No exaggeration; I had 5 cuts the first time using one of these Schick disposables.  They are awful.</li>
    <li> It is good that these come in a pack of 8 because it took me several to get through a single shave.  I won&#x27;t be bothering with these again.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this razor by taking one from my dads pack while at my parents.  This was the best disposable razor I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend using any razor without some kind of shave cream, but these work well with cream, gel, or soap.  They left my legs smoother than anything else.  Along with an exfoliating shave cream I&#x27;ve never had a smoother shave from any razor. Also, they rinse clean pretty easily and if you are tempted they can be used again with pretty good results.  I always go over the area I am shaving twice just to be sure and these razors hold up well through the process.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike some disposables they don&#x27;t wear out as quickly as others.  So you get more area shaved with one razor than two or three of some others.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better razor.  Now, I keep them on hand and an extra pack in case someone borrows/steals one of mine.  I have a secret pack of these so I am sure to have them on hand when  need them:)</li>
    <li> I have been using the Mach 3 for years now and I got the Schick in the mail as a freebie. I decided to finally try it after I ran out of Mach 3 blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that it did provide a good close shave the first two times I used it. Then on the subsequent attempts, I could feel it start to pull the hairs. On top of that, I started to get nicks and cuts. I have discontinued use after the fourth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not reccommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy these in bulk at Sam&#x27;s Club considering they were about half the price point as the Gillete Mach 3.They feel about half the price point. They wear out sooner, don&#x27;t give as clean a shave, and feel cheaper. I&#x27;d recommend paying the extra bucks to get the Mach 3.</li>
    <li> works well, last awhile.</li>
    <li> i have used these for over seven yrs and the same type ever since i started shaving - i am 49 and have never been satisfied with shaving.  recently i took the plunge to a safety razor and they are superior.  research it and see if its for you - you&#x27;ll save money and have less waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i shave my head and face about every 3-4 days and a safety razor is more comfortable esp. on my neck  - this product and its brethren all have close blades that pull and rip heavy growth and they cut below the skin - why are we cutting our skin ??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;shaving101.com gave me a lot of great insight but there are others too...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and shaving brushes and creams work too - you use less cream - considerably less and my brush is 10 yrs old - they last if you dry them upside down.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for two weeks. I shave every day. I have never had such a close shave as I get with this little guy. After two weeks it is still like new. This razor is a great buy. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Nice close shave and it lasts.</li>
    <li> I got one free, either by mail or with my paper (probably the latter). Can&#x27;t remember because it&#x27;s been almost 6 months and believe it or not I&#x27;ve been using it for that long exclusively to shave my fairly heavy beard. Seriously, I started using the Schick December 26, 2009 and just retired it. Well, I shave my compete face about every 2 days, so it never gets to \\&quot;beard\\&quot; stage. I think the trick is something I learned in a forum around a year ago: Dry your razor immediately after use and keep it dry until you use it again. I rinse thoroughly, tap off the clinging water on my sink, hug it in a dry towel and then remove from my humid bathroom. This prevents oxidation. Yes, it&#x27;s stainless steel, but even so it does deteriorate in the presence of moisture. I did this for some months with my Gillette CustomPlus Pivot 2 blade disposables (which lasted only ~6 weeks) before starting to use the Schick Xtreme I got as a freebie, and I used the drying technique after each use. I don&#x27;t have the packaging, so I don&#x27;t know what flavor it is, however I want some more. Hopefully, I will be pleased with whatever type I buy. Not to have to change for nearly 1/2 a year is terrific.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years.  I now only use them for emergencies but they are great for disposables.</li>
    <li> Generally something as small as a razor is not that important to write a review about. But...this one is different! After several attempts and so-so experiences with other both high and low-end products from other companies, I just picked up a set of these Schick razors at a local store. I was skeptical about the necessity of using 3 blades and was thinking of it as a solely marketing tactic. However, I am getting wonderful results with this product. My beard is not very heavy and I usually shave twice or 3times a week as an average. But I never had a single razor work for me for more than 3 months before this one. It is still sharp...well not as sharp as the first day but I still don&#x27;t feel that replacing is necessary. I may be able to use it for the next 4-8 weeks anyway. Of course with a heavy beard or more frequently shaving, I would not be able to use it for 6-8 months but for me, this has been the best and the most durable razor ever experienced. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> I used to buy these ALL the time and they were the only disposable razor that I would ever buy. They give an exceptionally close shave and can be used several times before discarding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These were out of stock when I last purchased, so I bought the female version: [[ASIN:B001ECQ3SG Schick Xtreme3 Sensitive, Women, 8-Count (Pack of 2)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The female version is 5 star (I&#x27;d give it 10 if I could), and worth the small extra cost. They provide an even closer shave and leave your skin extremely soft. I won&#x27;t buy any other razor.</li>
    <li> These work best for my heavy beard. Have tried bargain brand and even other name brands - they don&#x27;t last as long and/or result in nicks and cuts.</li>
    <li> The flexible nature of the blade makes this great for shaving your head.&lt;br /&gt;I am able to get a smooth shave and haven&#x27;t cut myself once by forcing to the curve of my head.&lt;br /&gt;I only use this on my head. I use a DE razor for my face.</li>
    <li> The product received was not the product in the picture.</li>
    <li> While tolerating a build up of clear plastic blade protectors from other disposable razors which always slid off and collected in the bottom my shaving kit I used to think that was another one of those planned obsolesce things so I would have to buy razors more often. After all, exposing the blades to whatever collision hazards that my shaving kit provides would just shorten their usefulness time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These razors have a better plastic protector they call &#x27;blade cover wings&#x27; that stay on these razors after they get tossed in my shaving kit keeping them truly protected.  Because of this little innovation each razor lasts longer and that means I&#x27;m saving money.  Good deal!</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t even go into how many different brands of razors I&#x27;ve tried over the 30+years of shaving. I&#x27;m not saying these are the best ever,but they work very well for me on my face and head. My wife and daughter use these as well and have no complaints. Close shave,no irritation and they last for weeks.i shave my face almost every day and my head once a week.</li>
    <li> Really like these disposable razors.  Shave several times&lt;br /&gt;before disposing.</li>
    <li> I switched to an electric razor 7 years ago because I could never find a razor that worked with my sensitive skin (can you say red bumps).  Anyway, when my electric razor died at a hotel recently, this was the sample they gave me.  I can&#x27;t believe this is a disposable razor!  Naturally, I researched all over again and tried everything (Sensor, Sensor Excel, Mach III, Mach III Turbo, Fusion, etc, etc) and this razor still comes out on top.  You could say I&#x27;m a dedicated loyal customer now.</li>
    <li> Bulk products work for me. Two teenaged boys in my house make bulk purchases a good idea. Okay, I like them too.</li>
    <li> This product has proven itself in our household for a very long time. The Schick Xtreme 3 Triple Blade does a great job and has a long service life. We keep one in the shower and use it as required and it continues to serve over an extended period of time with no shaving difficulties at all. We recommend it highly if one is looking for a reliable disposable razor.</li>
    <li> These are dull razors and leaves hair behind even going over the same spot and different directions. I did cuts and razor burn while using these. Could not be used more than 2 times. I have found these and love them https://www.harrys.com</li>
    <li> These are great if you have sensitive skin, they 3 blades and flexible head help prevent against irritation. They are also among the most reasonably priced as well. My go to razor!</li>
    <li> My favorite razors! They give you a really close shave with no nicks. I use these on my most sensitive parts.</li>
    <li> I bought this and Schick ST2 Disposable Razor Sensitive for Men, 12 Count. These are better than the Schick ST2. They give a close shave. Usually when I use razors to shave my mustache it hurts but with these it didn&#x27;t hurt. Just wish these were like $2-3 less.</li>
    <li> I use these for my head and I get a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> i love them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good value too&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but they are not available here in singapore; so i have to \\&quot;fly them in\\&quot; from the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i also find that to keep getting a close shave, it helps to change brand ever so often - schick to gillete o wilkinson, etc.</li>
    <li> After receiving one of these razors as a freebie with the Sunday paper I have officially become hooked. That first freebie lasted close to six months with no irritation or cuts to speak of. Just dry the blades right after using and these razors will last ages!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to save money on razors but dont want to use a cheapo plastic piece that will gouge you, give these razors a try.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, these are terrible razors.  I bought these, considering the price alone.  Well, I was disappointed to say the least.  They created razor burn, which the package specifically says they will not do!!  Can you believe that?  I shave with lotion because my legs are highly sensitive to razor burn and feel itchy after shaving.  I&#x27;ve found that lotion helps, but not with these razors!!!</li>
    <li> I really love this product. Some people would prefer the Gillette Fusion or Mach 3. I think a lot of that is hype. I &#x27;ve tried other razors but, the Xtreme 3 lasts along time and gives an excellent shave. I &#x27;d rather have to pay less and get the same close shave than to pay more and keep running out.</li>
    <li> These work great. Very sharp be careful</li>
    <li> Changing my review, I&#x27;ve grown to like these a lot more.  They get the job done and for me (shaving every other day, don&#x27;t grow a ton of facial hair), they last a month or so.</li>
    <li> At the first glance, i relied on the actual price discount it shows.&lt;br /&gt;Product came in real quick time.&lt;br /&gt;Later when i went to Sam&#x27;s club, i could figured out that this purchase was 50% higher the price/unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time i am disappointed at my Amazon purchase.</li>
    <li> This razor works as well or better than more expensive razors.</li>
    <li> Bought these blades previously in a store but now cannot find them so tried Amazon.  They are wonderful in that they stay sharp for a very long time and don&#x27;t nick your skin.  I use them for shaving my legs.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I first discovered these when they gave them away for free with the Skintimate shave gels. To my horror, I suddenly find they have discontinued the freebies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I had to go looking for this particular razor, because this is the only one I&#x27;ve used that leaves my legs nick free and very smooth. In combination with the Skintimate shave gel, I&#x27;m happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean, it is important not to bleed to death in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also purchased these in a pretty mauve which is so&lt;br /&gt;much more feminine. It does seem it is the exact same triple&lt;br /&gt;blade razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you take one of these razors and \\&quot;while the cover is still in place\\&quot; you press down on the top, you will see that the blade is very flexible and it also tilts back and forth. Also has a nice moisturizing strip to allow the blade to slide gently across your most sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evolutionary performance? YES&lt;br /&gt;Blades that don&#x27;t clog and rinse easily? YES&lt;br /&gt;Easy-to-remove Blade Cover? YES&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight and hand-friendly handle? YES&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think you will be equally impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> This is a horrible product. Bought theme at a local store and went home to shave with them for the first time and they just feel like they are pulling the hair out and not cutting. Mind you I just shaved the day before I purchased them and wanted to try something new. Man what a bad mistake it well never happen again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these razors for as long as they have been available.  I still remember the Andre Agassi commercials for these over 10 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of the latest and greatest 4 and 5 blade razors including the Schick Hydro 5. The latest being the Bic Flex 4.  It&#x27;s a fine razor and runs very smoothly over your face, but when I go back to the Xtreme, it&#x27;s like coming back to an old familiar friend.  I just find it works easier over all parts of the face and does a fine job.  I think one of the keys for me is they way the blades flex in the middle allowing it to go over chin areas without nicking me. Also, it&#x27;s easier to get in tight places like under your nose than those big bulky one.  It&#x27;s cheaper then all those fancy ones too.  I just hope they never stop making this razor.</li>
    <li> These razors work great on my scalp.  I use them about three or four times before tossing them, but I use them on my head and my beard since my hair on the top of my head is getting thinner by the day.  They offer the closest shave I&#x27;ve had on the top of my noggin since I&#x27;ve been shaving my noggin(about two years).  My only complaint is that my neck is rather sensitive, and this particular razor doesn&#x27;t handle my neck so well.  So, I&#x27;d recommend it more for shaving your head than your beard if you&#x27;re a tender, rugged man like myself, heh, heh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, it&#x27;s a pretty good razor that definitely has my vote when considering my scalp.  For my beard, I&#x27;m still on the lookout for a better blade.</li>
    <li> Dulls after 1-2 shaves. Even when I&#x27;m careful to dry off the blades after shaving. I use good quality shaving cream as well. I will not be buying these again, as I have found a New razor, that works.</li>
    <li> These work well for a close shave and they last long.</li>
    <li> For a disposable razor it works OK plus at a good price, seemed to last no more than ten days before needing disposal. Oth</li>
    <li> the blades are realy sharp. the tip is so flexible that I cut my nose edge twice. This was not happeninig with other blades .</li>
    <li> Excellent all-around disposable razor....the blades are much sharper than I expected and they last longer than the other brands I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;  I shave in the shower and the Schick Xtreme brand razor meets my requirements for having a non-slip handle....excellent grip.&lt;br /&gt;  This razor slides smoothly over my odd-shaped, bump ridden, but attractive head....no nicks...knock on wood.</li>
    <li> I finally decided to stop buying expensive razors and start buying these \\&quot;disposable\\&quot; razors. First, the obvious, these are much cheaper than purchasing the replacement heads for the 5+ razor systems. I get double the number of razors for the same price. Next, performance, for me these perform even better than some of the more expensive razors. I typically used Gillette brand products, these Schick are great. I get a close shave, with no cuts. The moisture bar on the razor is a bit much for me, but not a problem given I wash my face after shaving. Finally, longevity; these last! I&#x27;ll admit that I probably go through them faster than my other razors. However, I think that&#x27;s due to the fact that I no problem throwing these away when they&#x27;ve been used. I get about 15-18 uses out of these razors; which is about 4 to 5 weeks for me. Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with these razors and will continue to purchase them in the future.</li>
    <li> I love these.  Have the metal handled nice schick extreme 3, you can pry these off the disposable handle and they fit perfectly on the good handle at a fraction of the cost of cartridges.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this type razors for quite a while. Works well, but quality vent down in recent year or so and price crept up. That is why 3 stars and I&#x27;m considering switching to another razors now.</li>
    <li> Not a good or comfortable shave. Compared to the Mach 3s I usually use these suck. The shave is rough and to get a close shave you get a lot of razor burn even with heavy shaving gel. You get what you pay for...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for years, and this is the best razor I have found for it. The fact that the blades flex a little bit gives me a closer shave than I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> These razors performed as I had hoped they would. It was a good choice and I would choose it again. I had previously used them.</li>
    <li> I work overseas and can&#x27;t get a razor in shops to cut just right. They either bruise my face or don&#x27;t cut close enough but these work great every time.</li>
    <li> oh yeah, disposable razors are cool.... that&#x27;s why they use them in prison! just kidding, as cheap plastic razors go, these are OK. Maybe good for travel. but if your looking for a great shave, no. spend the extra bucks for a cartridge-or ,even better, and old school safety razor.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best razors fro shaving my legs. And the price cannot be beat. Have this on my subscribe &amp; save!</li>
    <li> Received my Schick Xtreme razor free in the Sunday paper.  Works fine.  But how in *#* do you change blades ?  No instruction book came with it.  Please give me instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RDolli8239@aol.com</li>
    <li> I shave my head, and love these!  The flexible blades hug the melon well and last over a week of shaving head every other day/face every day.  Very close shave and affordable.</li>
    <li> These are great and give a very close shave.  I have used each razor for one month and I shave nightly.</li>
    <li> These work pretty good for close shaves.  I believe I have gotten a bit cleaner shaves from Gilette, but this is good enough for the price, so I can recommend them with a clear conscience.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend prefers the Schick Hydro razor with 5 blades when these ones have three. For the rest, both flexible, disposable, ergonomic, easy to handle models are similar as they pivot for a closer shaving, and make skin softer than ever thanks to Aloe and vitamin E.&lt;br /&gt;The Hydro exists with three or five blades, and at that point I wonder if there will be an Xtreme 5 soon.</li>
    <li> The only razors my husband will use. He shaves his head and face everyday and loves these more then any designer razor that I seem to try to buy him.</li>
    <li> When we stayed at The Bellagio in Las Vegas, this is the razor they had in their bathrooms.  When we got home, my husband wanted me to find this particular razor.  I found them on Amazon.com and subscribe to them have have them sent regularly.</li>
    <li> these are exactly what they say they are: Schick Xtreme 3 sensitive razors. 5 stars for the product description. but for whatever reason, these sensitive razors do a number on my skin. could be I just don&#x27;t know how to properly shave or my skin is extra sensitive, but I give the usage of this product 3 stars. this an overall 4 star rating.</li>
    <li> As a girl,  these work pretty good.</li>
    <li> If you have anything more than a few days of stubble, these razors will clog with the hair and you can&#x27;t wash it clean in a basin or under the tap like with others I&#x27;ve used. Ok if you shave every day, but then it becomes pricey and fills landfills. The replaceable blades on things like mach 3 are very expensive, but do not clog and therefore can be used longer and are a better value</li>
    <li> I have a light beard, have been using these Schick Xtreme 3 Triple Blade razors for several years, get them automatically annually from Amazon. They give me a close shave.</li>
    <li> Read the other *RECENT* reviews, not the most helpful. The most helpful review was written in 2010 when this was the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; product. The newly designed ones (I think they released those in 2014), feel cheaper and cut terribly. They barely last two full shaves. Quality went from awesome to no thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope people read the recent reviews instead of buying the product based on a review written almost five years ago when it was the old product. The newer reviews on the &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; product says it all.</li>
    <li> These razors are great at shaving your noggin.  They flex just the right amount in the middle for the contours of your head.</li>
    <li> Close comfortable shave.  The only razor my husband will use.</li>
    <li> Love how the razor forms against your skin and gets close up for an awesome shave. Great disposable razor. Would recommend to anyone. My husband has tried many razors and this is the one he loves!</li>
    <li> I found this product through the Amazon subscribe and save program. It is now the only razor that my husband will use. His skin is very sensitive, so most razors cause nicks, cuts, scrapes and rashes. He has none of these problems using this razor. On occasion he will nick himself, but that is usually because he&#x27;s in a hurry! I will continue to buy this razor for as long as Amazon has it at such a good price. They are much more expensive at my local stores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every razor on the market (for reasons even I can&#x27;t explain) and have come to the conclusion that this razor is &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34; for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The shave is clean and long-lasting&lt;br /&gt;2. The chance for nicks is much less than most&lt;br /&gt;3. The razor head is wide, which provides stability and reduces shaving time&lt;br /&gt;4. The price is far less than the insanely-priced Gillette Fusion, which in my experience has some -- but not enough - benefits to justify its lofty cost.&lt;br /&gt;5. These razors can be purchased at very low prices not just a Amazon but at CVS and no doubt other retailers using a coupon or watching for a discount.&lt;br /&gt;6. Note: This razor has a better feel than the cartridge version, which is heavier and unbalanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, Schick finally got it right, eliminating the need to line Gillette&#x27;s pockets.</li>
    <li> Very sharp. I shave every two days and have not had a bad shave yet. I have used the razor about 15 times and it is still sharp.</li>
    <li> a great smooth shave.love these razors,used to buy the disposable target brand they sell which are very good but the xtreme blades bend unlike the target brand, which makes shaving better.i can get get about 6 or 7 shaves out of 1 razor before they get dull which is not bad.i just found my favorite razor,THE SCHICK XTREME DISPOABLE RAZOR,will be ordering more !.</li>
    <li> These are good disposable razors.  You get a nice close shave for a good price with the convenience of a disposable.  Good product to have on your Subscribe and Save account.</li>
    <li> So many baldies go with the Mach 3... this one bends in conformity to the curves of your head AND is disposable!  I can get 2 or 3 uses out of one razor before disposing.</li>
    <li> These hurt so bad I didn&#x27;t even finish the package. I&#x27;m not sure why there&#x27;s so many positive reviews. Ouch!</li>
    <li> Good price and good product.</li>
    <li> The quality of some of the razors recently shipped is not like the ones we got in months past. The handle breaks easily and often it takes more than one for my husband to shave just 1 time.</li>
    <li> I have very very sensitive skin and these are the only disposables I like to use. Much easier on the skin than other disposables.</li>
    <li> Not as good as fusion.  Too many cuts and limited blade life.</li>
    <li> The next best razor! Get em! The blade actually bends like paper and cuts great! Best buy for shaving your head!</li>
    <li> These razors ROCK! I will probably stop buying the Mach replacements after my mom bought me a pack of these on a whim. I get an incredibly close shave and have so far been using the same razor for a month. I highly recommend these razors.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s effective. The blade is pretty good and lasts for about a week of normal use. The price was pretty good compared to others. The shave was not the best but it was good enough. I will probably order them gain.</li>
    <li> Package reads Made in USA but its a lie!!! Give the 800 number call and ask them what country the razors are made and they will tell you China. They claim the parts are made in USA but its assembled in China. Sad Sad Sad that big business is shipping jobs over to China and they are allowed to say Made in USA when its made in China</li>
    <li> The redesign hasn&#x27;t given me any negative reactions,  yet. I am in different to the redesign, but I did figure out that you can transplant the entire new blade hokder onto the old handles.  That&#x27;s a plus.  Otherwise this might push me toward one of this mail shave clubs deals.</li>
    <li> These are the best disposable razors I ever had.&lt;br /&gt;I grabbed a new one at the gym a while back, and the thing ran for a month of p/t shaving !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great shave &amp; a GREAT deal here on Amazon !!</li>
    <li> Good razors, one of the best disposables around.  Nice sized package and worth the cost.  Good shave, clean and low drag.  Very comfortable.</li>
    <li> This razor flexes excessively in places you do not want it to.  It ends up cutting and nicking more than any other razor I have used.</li>
    <li> Nice item for the price. I will reorder when I need</li>
    <li> I have ordered these before, and for guys with sensitive skin, they are the best! I have a pretty heavy beard, use it every day, and each shaver will last me for about 3 weeks; so for me, they are a good bang for the buck; even tho they-- perhaps-- appear a bit pricey. Trust me, I shopped at my local chain drug store, as well as a division of the &amp;#34;Dollar&amp;#34; store systems, and they are priced more reasonable here on Amazon.  ON this order, they had a dollar coupon, which I applied, and when I got the package, there was a bonus of 2 extra shavers included---so that was even more of a surpize.  They are very smooth, dont cut my skin in anyway, no nics at all, no razor burn, and last a long time.  Will oder more as needed.</li>
    <li> I have been using Xtreme razors for many years. They work without the cuts and scrapes of regular razors. Three blades seem to be the right mix of price and performance.</li>
    <li> i bought these to see if they were any cheaper than my gilette and while they are cheaper i am not sure the few pence i save are worth it..need a couple of months more trial but i think alas those expensive trac 3 i use are the best..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Schick Xtreme 3 Triple Blade razors for years. Inexpensive, effective, and for a disposable razor, lasted a very long time. It seems, however, that recently Schick decided to change their design to a more &amp;#34;cost effective&amp;#34; one - i.e. Xtreme-ly cheap. These new razors now result in cuts and nicks from the simplest shaving passes. Target still had a few packs of the original style when I went over the weekend, but they too were starting to filter in the junkier version. Do yourself a favor and spend your money elsewhere. Now to find a new brand of razors...</li>
    <li> These razors are great. The blade and handles bend well, so that&#x27;s a big plus. Plus, they aren&#x27;t very rough on my dry skin, which is another great plus. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve tried every razor imaginable from disposable to mail-order to changeable blades to electric and this is by far the best razor for shaving your head due to the fact the blades are very flexible and when you get to the rounded part of the head which most people&#x27;s heads around the blade contours perfectly without putting that much pressure on it. If any company out there thinks they have a better razor for shaving your head I&#x27;ll be glad to give you an honest review.</li>
    <li> I started buying men razors when I browser my dads one day. I think i get a closer shave and the head pivots better on my knees without getting cut. So i get a better shave, they cost less than the woman styles and i get more in a box. Its a win win in my book</li>
    <li> The new design stinks!  Here is why I think so; I shave my head daily. The old handle had a rounded indent at the top of the shaver which made holding and maneuvering the shaver a breeze. The balance was perfect, it worked. This \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; handle no longer fits the thumb and hand. I&#x27;ve previously tried all the other top brands, they suffer this same problem. So in short, their new razor is now no better than any of the others.  FortunatelyI have three of the old handles that I reuse with with new blades.</li>
    <li> Good value &amp; quality.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Very good razor...I use it for face as well as shaving my head...anything more than a triple blade and it will clog when doing my scalp, so I&#x27;ve been using triple blades for years now...I must admit this is not the best triple i&#x27;ve used...some of the generic ones are better in regard to longevity...this razor is very good, but it does seem to wear out faster than most of the other triples I&#x27;ve used...not a huge deal, but it seems a bit like a built in design flaw to wear out early...the shave it provides is close with minimal to no razor burn, even when going against the grain...also a plus is that the design makes it slightly more difficult to cut your ear (if you have to shave your head you know what I am talking about).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would have given 5 stars but they don&#x27;t last as long as I would like.</li>
    <li> These razors are cheaper than the competitors razors I purchased last time. I won&#x27;t be purchasing these again and here is why; They clog easily. I shave daily and I shave in the shower, so I need a good razor that stays sharp and cleans well. These razors have some kind of brace from the handle to the head of the razor, so you can&#x27;t just run it under water and rinse it out. The center of the razor always has hair left in it. The hair in the center leads to rusting, which leads to an awful shave. I tried to clean it out really well, and I was fairly successful with a bunch of effort, but the razor still loses its edge after about 8 shaves. I&#x27;m not sure if that’s good or bad for a &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; but the other guys are good for at least a month. I wouldn’t say nobody should buy these. I&#x27;m sure they have a market somewhere, but for me, these are awful.</li>
    <li> This gets off my coarse hairs without knicks! I love these razors. I use a homemade conditioner as a shaving cream (oil, guar gum and water).</li>
    <li> I use these for travel.  Quick and easy purchase and a great value. I&#x27;ll buy more next time I need them.</li>
    <li> I really like the Schick razors in that they bend to curve around the face (in particular the chin area).  I wish there was a blade-only replacement system for less money (seems like less waste).</li>
    <li> My favorite disposable razors! They last for a while. Shave very well. I can even use them without shaving cream and the razor burn is very minimal. The shave great too! I don&#x27;t have to go over spots to get rid of stubble.</li>
    <li> I ordered and got this in one day. These folks are awesome. Great product!</li>
    <li> Great razor for the price, last lobger than the cheaper store dispoable razors, been using them for years. Never cuts and ultra smooth for a 3 bladed razor</li>
    <li> My husband has used these for years and has always been pleased.  I was happy to find them on Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save program.  Now I don&#x27;t have to remember to buy them in the store every month.</li>
    <li> Great to order and not have to shop for</li>
    <li> great blades. i use it to shave my head. blades stay nice and sharp for about two-three shaves.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product ever since they were introduced.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 67 years old, recently retired and was a mechanical engineer.&lt;br /&gt;Not only has this product changed it&#x27;s look but also it&#x27;s quality.&lt;br /&gt;It used to be the best and last the longest but in recent years has gone downhill.&lt;br /&gt;They were sharper to begin with and would stay sharper much longer. Apparently the steel used or the process has changed in manufacturing so they can sell more product and as a result you now have an inferior product compared to it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;predecessor.</li>
    <li> Works like it is supposed to!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the brand product. I like them. Cheap and decent blades. Not the sharpest but I don&#x27;t shave hard core. Just trimming to keep the beard clean mostly.</li>
    <li> These blades last about a month for me, and I have a relatively heavy beard.&lt;br /&gt;The lubricant strip doesn&#x27;t last too long, but that&#x27;s not really an issue.&lt;br /&gt;Relatively close shave -- good enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: shave with oil. Face doesn&#x27;t dry out and bladed don&#x27;t gunk up and last longer.</li>
    <li> Three qualifiers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I&#x27;m a man and only shave my face 2-3 times a week, sans goatee, so the blades last a bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;2) I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Peppermint Oil Soap rather than shave cream.  Love it.&lt;br /&gt;3) Shave immediately after showering (I know, TMI)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Schick Xtreme 3 Triple Blades are above average and do a good job of clearing stubble on first pass, although a second pass in the opposite direction often enhances smoothness. The lubricating strip lasts 4-5 shaves, and I find the blade getting dull to the point of discomfort after 8-10 shaves. Because the head is limited to 3 blades I can easily shave the under-nose-above mustache area.  Try that with a 5 blade shaver...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is comfortable and the blades are easy to clean with a quick jet of water. I recycle the handles and packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Schick Xtreme 3 Triple Blades are well made and last about as long as I expected. Good performers.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor, I&#x27;ve been using them for years.  I use one for a week and then disassemble and toss into the recycling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll give these razors, four stars. not what I usually buy, but decent for the price. one razor last a few uses (stays sharp) if soaked in baby oil afterwards.</li>
    <li> I love these razors.  One time I used one razor for 6 months.</li>
    <li> These are great. Close shave.</li>
    <li> Always buy this product locally, but for sometime, finding it is a task. Use it for daily use and when we travel.</li>
    <li> I got these on the subscription which makes them affordable . Gives me a good shave, has a lubricating edge that works fine for me .&lt;br /&gt;I like these for traveling or the gym ,  very light and easy to handle . I personally get a good week and a half of shaves out of each one .</li>
    <li> My husband has been using the Schick Xtreme 3 Triple Blade Closeness Razors for Sensitive skin for as long as it has been on the market. We buy the 8 count pkg from Amazon as most of the stores we shop don&#x27;t carry that amount size. My husband use to shave twice a day and has found this razor can get closer the first time. And there is no razor rash with the Aloe for Sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Impressed with these.</li>
    <li> These razors would not even work for one shave. I have a rough beard but disposable razors should be good for a few shaves. Today I took out a new razor and I could not even shave my beard one time. I would return them but its to much trouble. Total rip off.</li>
    <li> My experience with these razors has been less than favorable!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lite beard and can actually skip shaving for a day and no one would probably notice.  Using one of these razors to shave with was NOT a good shaving experience for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor seemed extremely dull to begin with. Halfway through shaving, I grabbed another razor to complete the shave.  Both were horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These razors were a complete waste of my time, my money and what&#x27;s left of my facial skin after using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spend the $$ in the first place to buy decent razors and be done with it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve stopped shaving with the single edged razor of death and switched to these. The three blades decapitate my facial hair just as well. Plus, no more accidental ear lobe accidents, no more shaving off the top layer of skin, no more sneezing and become noseless again. Zero blood, zero drama, just shaving.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this brand for a number of years.  We were glad to see them offered on Amazon at a good price and have the bonus of them being shipped at regular intervals.</li>
    <li> These are my fav shavers and I have tried so many. Even though they are disposalble they are tough on leg hair. I will always buy these and I bought them online because I live VERY remotely.</li>
    <li> I love it!  Schick should have stopped here with their invention.  It does all that is necessary and then some.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite razor to date. The way the razor flexes allows me to shave my head (which I do every three days) quickly and easy with no cuts. I also dry the razor off when finished (a wet razor will dull quicker) and each one lasts me 5-6 months. So every three days I shave my entire head and the top and bottom of my beard. Totally worth it- a great razor.</li>
    <li> Unless you keep it dry, these arent very good for more than maybe 2 uses. they get very dull very fast. but for the one or two uses they are fantastic and cheap razors. a pack of eight lasts me a while</li>
    <li> Husband loves these.  Now he will not use anything else.  No wonder because these are easy on sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;and they shave nice and close without injury.  You definitely can&#x27;t go wrong in buying these!  A+</li>
    <li> if you&#x27;re trying to shave your legs, you&#x27;ll need to go through at least two of these razors or else you&#x27;ll break out in razor burn from the comfort strip wearing away immediately.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price for the quality. Even at major discount retailers you&#x27;d pay a whole more. My husband has very sensitive skin and these razors don&#x27;t give him the after-shave burn or rash other razors do. I give them 2 thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Found them to be one of the best razors I have ever used. I shave my head and they work great !</li>
    <li> What I like best about these razors is the handle.  I have used comparable Gillette razors and when the handle gets wet is slips in my hand and makes shaving more difficult.  Both Gillette and Schick seem to do a good job and last a long time.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: Still using the Extreme3 Sensitive Desposable and just Love this Razor! I try to find something wrong with it and can not. It just won&#x27;t cut/nick or cause razor burn. It really is the most perfect razor I&#x27;ve ever shaved with; better than it&#x27;s brothers the Hydro&#x27;s, the Quattro and the Schick ST2 (which I&#x27;m passionate about my ST2&#x27;s) and the Quattro is darned hard to beat...but the Extreme3 is as close to a perfect razor I&#x27;ve ever had.  Give it a try!  Also: You won&#x27;t find a better price anywhere online than Amazon.com for this (and many) product! It pays to go Prime too:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been on a year long search for the \\&quot;Perfect Razor\\&quot; to shave with and I&#x27;ve finally found it in the Schick Xtreme 3 Triple Blade Sensitive.  With a medium/coarse beard and sensitive skin (that&#x27;s gotten worse as I get older) I just got sick of the constant compromise between a smooth close shave with raw throbbing face for 2 - 3 days or a comfortable shave and a face with patches of stubble.  The Schick Xtreme 3 gives me a smooth, close shave with no stubble but also with no razor burn and no nicks or cuts as long as I practice the shaving technique recommended by Edge Shave Gel; which I also have purchased from Amazon.com.  For others like me that also use a shaving brush and shaving soap; this razor works great with my Proraso shaving soap for sensitive skin and my tweezerman&#x27;s shaving brush; both of which I bought at Amazon for a better price than I found elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the D/E razors and twin blade cartridges, you don&#x27;t have to do a 3 - or - 4 way shave with a triple blade razor.  Edge suggests you wash your face first, apply their shaving gel (which is the best I&#x27;ve ever used), let the lather sit on your beard for three minutes to soften the beard and then shave...Against The Grain!  That&#x27;s almost heresy to me:)  After 44 years of shaving the idea of not taking the beard down in stages and starting against the grain...makes me wince in pain at the thought of it. But it works!  The only thing I do different is I also use the Proraso Pre-Shave cream I purchased here at Amazon.com to provide myself with a slicker shaving surface before I apply the shave gel and I shave against the grain for my entire face with no problem at all.  The Schick Xtreme 3 glides smoothly across my face against the grain, weather it&#x27;s a next day shave or after three days of not shaving.  I get about 7 - 8 shaves per razor which costs me about 0.17 cents a shave at Amazon&#x27;s great price and that&#x27;s good enough for me.  Price is very important to me but watching the shaving cream turn pink with blood oozing through my pores with the D/E blades and the pain afterward...0.17 cents is cheap enough.  It&#x27;s an excellent razor for sensitive skin and the Edge Shave Gel &#x27;against the grain&#x27; instructions gives me a perfect pain free shave with a once over instead of going over my face several times or doing multiple touch ups.

    <li> I have been paying about three times the price for the more expensive blades (Mach 3, Fusion, etc.) since they generally keep me from suffering major blood loss. I really like the more expensive blades, but constantly paying so much for them is making my wallet bleed. Fortunately, I found these razors. You get the entire razor at a much better price and both my face &amp; wallet are happy.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great price. Better than other disposable razors that I have used. Received one for free with a shave cream or else I would not have known about them</li>
    <li> Throwaway blades just don&#x27;t cut it! Uncomfortable, liable to cause occasional nicks I would never use these, or any other brand , of throwaways.</li>
    <li> Best for me. Have switched to other brands and it not near the comfort, closeness that I need. I am a Schick extreme 3 guy.</li>
    <li> Really smooth shave, Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I use Gillette Mach3 for my face, and this product for my neck. If you have trouble with your neck, definitely try this. You may want a tad higher quality for your face though.</li>
    <li> These are no-where as good as the 4 blade ones I used for 10+ years, I haven&#x27;t cut myself shaving in years with those and cut myself the first time using this razor as it seemed rough, not smooth as it went over my skin - I will revert back to my other 4 blade brand</li>
    <li> great quality, i have better luck with the schick&#x27;s not rusting as fast as bic and gillette.  bit cheaper here than at albertsons.  and the only one on the shelf made in usa!</li>
    <li> Very smooth and good for sensitive skin. This gives me a very close shave and its quite smooth over your skin.</li>
    <li> Almost time to order again! Great buy and quality and cheaper than in the stores!</li>
    <li> I love these for travel, but they are good enough to use for a week at least if you wanted.</li>
    <li> Good and handy razors.</li>
    <li> The 1st time I get to know this item was on a flight with an airline that is known for its best in-flight service. It was provided for passengers toilets in the Business Class. I kept using it for a duration of more than 2 months ( usage at intervals of 3 days). It provide a clean shave that lasted for 3 days. I love it but do not know where to purchase it until I found it in Amazon.com. Everyone who needs a clean and lasting shave should try using it.</li>
    <li> excellent product, I recommend</li>
    <li> Love these blades for shaving my head they take form to curves</li>
    <li> These razors are NOT good. They are so dry that they stuck to my skin, even with using high-quality shaving cream. Shave is not even, nor smooth. After the shave, my skin turned out dry and irritated. Put a little money into a higher-quality razor. It&#x27;s definitely worth it and makes a huge difference.</li>
    <li> Hard to clean, short use period</li>
    <li> I have been using these for several years and they go beyond my expectations for a durable razor and a good, close shave.  This pricing was excellent as well.  It was the equivalent of buying two packs and getting one free.  What more can I ask?</li>
    <li> These razors are excellent.  They get my face smooth with less irritation then my electric razor used to.  Not only do their triple blades make them better then other disposable razors, but their design makes them easier to use then the Mach III.  And a pack is cheaper then the Mach III refill blades as well.&lt;br /&gt;My personal preference is the aloe vera coated blades, but any variety is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this deal. Would recommend to family and friends. This is why i dont fill these things out.</li>
    <li> these have  held up nicely and my daughter can use on her sensitive skin</li>
    <li> my husband loves these</li>
    <li> Best price I&#x27;ve found, and great for shaving legs.</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised</li>
    <li> Worst shave I can remember.  The handle feels like a log; the head doesn&#x27;t seem to follow the contours of my face.  I bought a whole bunch of them, and I will throw them out as soon as I buy some more Mach 3.</li>
    <li> Razor is OK and lasts for a few shave. Comparable to most other disposable razors. The price is reasonable for this item</li>
    <li> Cheapest and easiest way to shave, thanks to Amazon.  Razor blade cartridges are crazy expensive.</li>
    <li> I love these. Why pay more for fancy razors when these are awesome. I have medium thick facial hair and I get about 10 shaves out of one of these before I have to toss them. I do not shave every day so a pack of these last me about 90 days</li>
    <li> This razor is amazing. I only wish I discovered it sooner in life.  Close shave, leaves your skin feeling great. I&#x27;m so happy I discovered these!!</li>
    <li> This product was a great stocking stuffer for my son-in-law who specifically requested this item on his Christmas suggestion list.</li>
    <li> Great for travel and also for visitors</li>
    <li> Used these for a long time now and I think they may be even better than the more expensive razors.</li>
    <li> Flawless shaver from Schick. The blades are sharp and it&#x27;s easy to clean, its easy rinse feature prevents blades from clogging.</li>
    <li> I have never reviewed a product, positively or negatively, but this is worth it.  I have never felt worse. I have shaved for 15 years, using dollar razor blades as well as the best.  I cut myself twice, and feel like a 17 year old suicide victim. Do not buy this product.</li>
    <li> One day in 2001 I was stranded in California for the night and had no toiletries. I visited a super market and purchased these extreme 3 razors. They were far better than any I have ever used before - or since. I have tried the new Gillette expensive variety which cost a lot of money and last no time at all and the so-called &#x27;razor&#x27; tug doesn&#x27;t occur with these either. It looks like the &#x27;improvements&#x27; in razor technology is little more than marketing. These razors last longer and my only concern is that they will stop making them. The best value for money - a bit like having a posh razor set, without the hassle.</li>
    <li> I received these razors as a stocking stuffer. At first, I was not going to use them. (A couple years ago, I stopped using &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; razors after I discovered how higher quality blade refills could be cared for and last for weeks or months.) I decided that I was going to use these up as soon as possible, so that I could get back to my favorite razor. Boy, was I surprised when this thing kept going and going. I have a new pack of Fusion refills waiting to go, but I&#x27;m in no hurry to toss the Schick away. Hint: By the way, if you want these blades to last a while, rinse them clean (don&#x27;t rub), blow them out with air, and let them dry naturally.</li>
    <li> Good razors!  Did their job!  I get nicked easily.  These were pretty gentle and still did a pretty nice job on the close shave.</li>
    <li> I love these blades. I&#x27;ve been purchasing generic 3-blade disposable razors for a few years (because I thought they were a better value) and decided to get the name brand this time. Holy Buckets!!! These last at least 5x to 10x longer, are more comfortable, clean WAY easier, and stay sharp 10x better than any generics I&#x27;ve ever used. I was stunned, to say the least. I will not be getting generics anymore and would highly recommend these blades!!</li>
    <li> Nice , smooth and close shave.  Lasted more than one shave like most others.&lt;br /&gt;Did not pull after a three day beard.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely stick with these</li>
    <li> This product is being of great help as I also use it to shave my head. The shaving is smooth and have no irritation on my scalp. I would recommend the use of this kind of razors.</li>
    <li> exactly as described, even came early. smooth clean shave. will probably buy again when the time comes. worth a try !</li>
    <li> I used to buy womans razors which are about double the price for half the blades. This particular razor gives a baby smooth cut and the head pivots</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m someone who doesn&#x27;t want to pay too much for razor blades and want something that has decent quality. These are good triple blades and the price on Amazon is really good. They last for about 3-4 weeks with regular use and the great thing is they don&#x27;t pull or tug your facial hair when you&#x27;re shaving and has minimal razor burn. Although Gillette and other brands have good quality blades, the prices they charge are way too high for razor blades (the high price helps these companies pay for naming rights to football stadiums, i.e. Gillette Stadium home of the NE Patriots, endorsements by Clay Matthews and Tiger Woods); sorry I would rather keep my money and use a decent blade rather than line the pockets of these celebrities.</li>
    <li> I wear a nicely beard and love Schick Xtreme dispo razors for keeping a well-groomed appearance -- and these offer a comfortable shave even when used dry (as I do).  They stay comfortable for 4-5 uses this way, with no skin irritation!</li>
    <li> I shave my head and face every other day. In my opinion, these are the best razors money can buy. 5 stars for the product itself. They cost the same on Amazon as they do in the store but Amazon Prime is much more convenient.</li>
    <li> probably the best disposible razor made, IMO. Tried the more expensive ones, but always come back to these. a good price for these razors and quick secure ship.</li>
    <li> I shave about twice a week, these are better than average disposable razors.  the triple blade feels good and I like the aloe and how the head shifts to the angle you place it on your skin (so you don&#x27;t cut yourself).</li>
    <li> One word review &amp;#34;GARBAGE&amp;#34;! Although the words &amp;#34;Extreem3 appear on the razor handle; the word SHICK does NOT. The razor has lost its great balance by the manufacturer reducing the weight from 12 grams to 10 grams. I have been using SHICK razors since I started shaving 59 years ago! Customer till the end! This IS the end! I shall use up the 50 that I ordered then revert to Clam Shells to scrape my face. I hope the Public doesn&#x27;t allow SHICK to get away with this crap.</li>
    <li> Not practical to shave with - not getting a close shave.</li>
    <li> i love the flexible blades for shaving my legs and armpits.  no knicks, ever. i tend to find that men&#x27;s blades last longer than women&#x27;s blades so I buy men&#x27;s products.  if the blade lasted longer than 2 weeks against my not heavy female leg hair I would give it 5 stars but 2 weeks with one razor is pretty good.</li>
    <li> great razor and price</li>
    <li> I NEEDED THESE BECAUSE AS A WOMAN WITH A BEARD IT&#x27;S EMBARRASSING BUT THESE WORK SO YOU CAN&#x27;T Tell I HAVE ONE AND WORK GOOD ON UNDER ARMS TOO.</li>
    <li> I love the Schick Xtreme triple blade razors.  been using them for years.  Have tried a few that were suppose to be similar....Nah...this is the best one ever.</li>
    <li> there is no schick name on these razor blades. these are a different color than the ones sold in the store. also they are not what is shown in the product description. strange.</li>
    <li> Typical disposable razor.  Is pretty dull feeling by the end of the week and is very unforgiving on problem spots on your face...if the hair grows weird or whatever.</li>
    <li> If I could I would give this a NO STAR! They&#x27;re good if you don&#x27;t shave against the grain, but if you want a clean shave you have to shave against the grain... Sooo What&#x27;s the point? Plus I was very much annoyed that when I started shaving my hairs were getting stuck in the blades and full on stuck... I couldn&#x27;t even rinse them off in the water... So this just sucks! The best think about this is it uses vitamin e and aloe... but that&#x27;s it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So no star!</li>
    <li> Used to love these disposables...but the new design resulted in a lighter weight, cheap razor that no longer works at all how it did before.  Even when I decided to suffer the cheap plastic the razor nicks and cuts from the first use ( I tried three different ones from the pack!)...very sad considering the use to last for weeks.</li>
    <li> As of this month, I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for 10 years. I&#x27;ve tried everything from straight razors to disposables to electrics and back again. These are BY FAR the best razors I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve used nothing else for the last 4 years or so. Get my neck, head, and face VERY smooth and last a long time without dulling too!</li>
    <li> These work well. They are not perfect, but they are disposable razors and are not supposed to be perfect. Works for me.</li>
    <li> Great razor for the price. Provides nice close shaves without skin irritation. Also stays sharp for many shaves.</li>
    <li> best disposable razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> These used to be my favorite razor, but the last time I ordered I received a much cheaper darker green version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HATE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon still has the older lighter green version pictured but i&#x27;m not willing to risk it.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I had found the one - the search unfortunately has restarted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product even has a satisfaction guarantee - but companies know that most consumers will not jump through all the hoops necessary to receive their money back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An awesome bad move from whatever suit decided the product needed a change.</li>
    <li> Have used tis Schick razor for some time now ... works real well for me and the price is reasonable.  Net-net ... based on my experience.</li>
    <li> I have been using Schick Xtreme 3 for years.  I have never had problems with them and usually get 5 or 6 shaves with them before they dull somewhat.  I ordered new ones and by looking at them they looked identical to the old ones other then the color and a small change in the handle part.  I shaved with one and it felt like I shaved with a very dull blade or blades and it was almost painful.  My old ones did not feal like that or even close after 6 shaves.  I do not know, what Schick did or changed, but these blades are not usable at all.  I am not sure, if I can sent them back to Amazon, but will converse with Amazon about it. I would not recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> These work very well. I have tried disposables in the past and these are the best.</li>
    <li> I usually get no name double blade razors.  One of these was given to me by a friend when we were traveling and I ran out.  It is the best razor i have ever used.  It is smooth, shaves close, and quickly.  I am really happy.  Because of it, I tried a few other triple blades, but this is the best.  It will usually last 7 days, the same as the double bladed ones.</li>
    <li> These are my standby, and I have them on subscribe order every 2 months.  If I could stomach the price, I&#x27;d order Gillette Mach 3 Turbos as they are the best IMO.  These are a fair trade off and a decent price.  I like using them with Taylor of Old Bond Street tub shaving creams (Avocado and Eton College are my favorites).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 26 year old woman and I&#x27;ve used these razors since I was 12. They&#x27;ve never nicked me, ever—and I can get pretty wild with a blade. I&#x27;ve tried every other new hotness thinking it&#x27;d work...they all ended up in the trash. These last forever, erase stubble, and gently do what they promise.</li>
