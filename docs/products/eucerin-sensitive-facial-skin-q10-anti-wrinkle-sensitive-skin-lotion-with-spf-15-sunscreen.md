      <li>My face and skin are loving both of these!</li>

      <li>I get so many compliments from people about my skin now!</li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>Great light lotion i noticed difference in mu skin after couole days of use.</li>
      <li>you are purchasing this to wear under product, around the house/yard, or just for the benefits of wearing a light moisturizer/sunscreen, it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>Summer or Winter, the moisture that this product provides is amazing.</li>
      <li>Nice product, well priced.</li>
      <li>The lotion is kind of greasy for my skin.  </li>
      <li>A nice face cream.</li>
      <li>A nice feature this product has is that it doesn&#x27;t leave that whitened look on your skin after application as a lot of lotions with sunscreen do.</li>
      <li>I have always liked the products of Eucerin.</li>
      <li>The product is great, but I might be able to get it more inexpensively somewhere else.</li>
      <li>Excellent moisturizer for sensitive skin and absorbs nicely without greasy feeling.</li>
      <li>But I was very happy with being able to find the product at Amazon at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Love love it!</li>
      <li>It seems to be doing a good job preventing wrinkles because they&#x27;re not increasing as fast as they might, but even more important is how wonderful my skin feels.</li>
      <li>Tend to use it more in the winter though as it is kind of oily/shinny.</li>
      <li>This cream is excellent for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Best moisturizer with SPF for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It is light on the skin and does not feel greasy but provides good coverage against the sun.  </li>
      <li>They are perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>very light, non greasy.</li>
      <li>Whether that is true or not, it is a good thing because it makes me feel better about myself.</li>
      <li>Q10 help moisturize your skin and reduce fine lines and wrinkles leaving you with a nice glowing complexion</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Now my favorite lotion-</li>
      <li>help keep your skin healthy...</li>
      <li>I love this and all Eucerin products I have tried.</li>
      <li>This is a nice, light moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>What more can I say?</li>
      <li>my skin is soft , smooth , perfect</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m enjoying it.  </li>
      <li>Light, but effective.  </li>
      <li>Wish it gave more moisture</li>
      <li>I have been using this lotion for quite some time - probably about 9 months now, and I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>I love that it contains SPF too.</li>
      <li>This is my all time favorite day moisturizer with sunscreen.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite moisturizers.  </li>
      <li>Hoping for more as I continue to use it.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin, and is not greasy like many products with SPF do.</li>
      <li>i recommend the product you can buy it several times excellent bran</li>
      <li>and you can be confident</li>
      <li>and I love that it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Fantastic moisturizer!</li>
      <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
      <li>LOVE IT,</li>
      <li>LOVE</li>
      <li>I have been using this for years and love it.  </li>
      <li>Tried CeraVe facial moisturiser which burned my skin, though this one works wonderfully.</li>
      <li>Light, effective.</li>
      <li>I love this product, but I can never find it in the store.  </li>
      <li>many products applied to my face.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m probably on my 10th bottle, because I continually use this stuff and am so satisfied I don&#x27;t want to try anything else.  </li>
      <li>The Eucerin is thicker than the gel-cream texture of the Garnier, and while neither has an overwhelming scent, the Garnier has a stronger scent.  </li>
      <li>Ok, I&#x27;ve hit my limit.  </li>
      <li>i am hopeful that i am going to love this product i will keep you posted.</li>
      <li>Look at the ingredients and you&#x27;ll see many known irritants.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Again, it is ok as a sunblock, but not how it is advertised.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>It is not always easy to get a good selection of Eucerin products where I live, so was thrilled to find them on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use Eucerin Lotion on my face as I&#x27;ve never found anything else that is perfect for my skin type (oily t-zone, dry everywhere else)</li>
      <li>After apply it, my face feels very smooth and light, and I do not feel any irritation at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this product it helps with fine lines and wrinkles</li>
      <li>This lotion works great on sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Works great under makeup and doesn&#x27;t burn my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Great for really sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Good lotion with spf and a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>It really works and makes my skin feel so good.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has pump dispenser which makes easy to use, and it doesn&#x27;t smell any strong fragrance, the texture is very smooth and light.</li>
      <li>This is a nice, light, day lotion containing adequate sunscreen protection.</li>
      <li>so I get redness and irritation easily.</li>
      <li>Easy to use under makeup.</li>
      <li>is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t have any smell.</li>
      <li>and it goes on easy.  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply.</li>
      <li>A bit oily and shiny as with most true SPF products.</li>
      <li>It would probably be fine for this without sensitivity issues.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Minimizes fine lines -</li>
      <li>No visible difference in pore size, acne, or fine lines</li>
      <li>My skin is calmer, my fine lines have all but disappeared, and it continues to make my skin softer than the Garnier moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>This is fine as a Sunscreen lotion but the front labeling and description on Amazon is misleading.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know if the anti-wrinkle aspect of it works, but I love the hydration of this moisturizer - adequate but does not make my combination skin greasy.  </li>
      <li>This is the best sensitive skin anti-wrinkle with SPF lotion I have found by far!  </li>
      <li>two huge</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s light</li>
      <li>Great product that can&#x27;t be found in my local drugstores.</li>
      <li>the sunscreen in it is so important.  </li>
      <li>Not greasy at all,very light weight.</li>
      <li>This is a great lightweight daily lotion.</li>
      <li>Moisturizes, prevents wrinkles, and gives light sun coverage.</li>
      <li>Feels light and smoothe.</li>
      <li>Scent free.</li>
      <li>It does not irritate my skin or cause breakouts and leaves my skin smooth and well hydrated.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin silky smooth.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, leave a smooth look.</li>
      <li>Silky smooth, non-greasy, doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts, and it contains sunscreen.</li>
      <li>silky smooth.</li>
      <li>I truly does smooth out wrinkles (I am 52), and does so with a light, non-greasy feel.  </li>
      <li>Maybe this product is great for some people, but definitely not for me!</li>
      <li>My skin felt hydrated and smooth after I applied it, and it was immediately absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A light dusting of face powder corrected it immediately, but it still gives me pause.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product glides on so smoothly and moisturizes so well.</li>
      <li>I like the fact that it is light and soaks in.  </li>
      <li>This is a light moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Good moisturizer for sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Anyhow, once they stopped selling it, I figured that Eucerin, being part of the same family of companies should be able to come up with a good Q10/spf alternative.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Eucerin sensitive for years and have always loved</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>This cream has excellent texture and no strong smell.  </li>
      <li>This is light and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s an awesome product that absorbs well and leaves the skin soft and younger looking.</li>
      <li>This is a SUPER light lotion-</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.  </li>
      <li>My mother and sisters are using this lotion more than four years and they are so satisfied with the Eucerin Q10 Anti-Wrinkle Sensitive Skin Lotion.</li>
      <li>I think this is very gentle and good for some sensitive skins like me...</li>
      <li>VERY good on sensitive skin, the scent is light to non-existent, provides sun screen, and I swear the Q10 actually does help with wrinkles given time.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I can purchase them online at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>initial impression of the Eucerin is good--</li>
      <li>It is not greasy and is an excellent moisturizing, anti-wrinkle cream with a good strength SPF for ordinary daily use that blends right into the skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Oil Free Moisture SPF 15 for many years but wanted to try something new.</li>
      <li>Eucerin Q10 &amp; SPF: Quickly absorbs without  greasiness or clogging pores.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s non greasy quick to soak in moisture.</li>
      <li>I have mild roseacea.  </li>
      <li>Will remain loyal.</li>
      <li>you see that this is simply a mild sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was looking for a light daily lotion that would also provide sun-protection and be great on my sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light but actually moisturizes, something I have found that most &#x27;light&#x27; lotions do not do.</li>
      <li>This allows me to systematically test whether or not the new lotion is actually better, as well as control for hormone swings/</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, and i love this moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>It is light and not greasy, but really moisturizes.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite daytime moisturizer, and I have tried almost every sensitive skin moisturizer (cerave, cetaphil, olay).</li>
      <li>For sensitive skin, be sure that it says so.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not sweat resistant at all, it slides right off in humid weather</li>
      <li>right before I put my make-up on.  </li>
      <li>It is not greasy on the face and gives the right amount of hydration to keep my face supple throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>Apply right after showering.</li>
      <li>The price is pretty good comparing with other brands of the same kind.</li>
      <li>this is NOT fragrance free it smells like normal sunblock.</li>
      <li>Actually my husband uses it now, and it is really good for sensitive skin, like his!</li>
      <li>It does kind of make my hands feel a bit dry after i run it on my face</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like the smell at first</li>
      <li>I, too, wish, that the SPF were higher, though.</li>
      <li>sure wish Eucerin had a light and non-greasy daily lotion for sensitive skin with UV 15 protection.  </li>
      <li>And this SPF 15 lotion makes my face feel so soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I can mix it with my make up for more sheer coverage.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for over 5 years now and can&#x27;t find anything better, especially to wear under makeup.</li>
      <li>My skin now feels soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, fast absorbing, and gentle on my face.</li>
      <li>Will definitely buy more products from Eucerin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used so many and always come back to this one as I always notice clearer, healthier looking skin.  </li>
      <li>Love this facial sun screen, I wear it every day under my make-up.</li>
      <li>This lotion is gentle and moisturizing--and I get sun protection too!</li>
      <li>Feels lightweight and I like that the bottle is bigger than many face lotion bottles.</li>
      <li>To make sure I wasn&#x27;t imagining it, I asked my boyfriend to tell me if he could feel a difference between the two sides of my face, without telling him which side was which, and he also said that the left side was softer.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
      <li>Just beware that when it&#x27;s first applied to skin, it can create an unflattering effect.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it takes much more time for anything like this to actually give visual results</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s the same great non greasy formula that doesn&#x27;t cause me any breakouts and keeps me from dry skin.</li>
      <li>I am 64, and recently two young girls commented on my nice complexion...</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t help to much with my wrinkles but it was moisturizing and great for delicate skin.</li>
      <li>SPF 15, for daily use, light on the skin, quickly absorbed.</li>
      <li>A great, inexpensive alternative to much more expensive moisturizers!</li>
      <li>, I was quite certain</li>
      <li>The Eucerin absorbs more slowly, and doesn&#x27;t spread as easily as the Garnier, but the skin feels softer when it&#x27;s absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The Eucerin felt slightly heavier and was not as comfortable throughout the day to my sensitive skin as the Olay was (most suntan lotions feel like they burn to me -</li>
      <li>This is first time I&#x27;m trying this brand since it got high ranking in Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>I really see a difference in the appearance of my skin when I use it.</li>
      <li>I have rosacea, and have a real problem finding face creams/lotions that don&#x27;t irritate my overly-sensitive skin, and sill work.  </li>
      <li>Very moisturizing and has SPF as well.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles yet</li>
      <li>Plus the odor of it was very off putting.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed much in terms of wrinkles</li>
      <li>My make-up foundation goes on much smoother.</li>
      <li>I use it daily and really enjoy it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m yet to see what this does, delivery was fast.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Using daily under light coat of foundation.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t care a whole lot.</li>
      <li>I had so much hope for this product based on the reviews.  </li>
      <li>I also really like Eucerin&#x27;s Q10 cream for night use.</li>
      <li>but i really did want people to know that it has that smell and that that smell lingers throughout the day.</li>
      <li>Prompt shipping, thanks.</li>
      <li>It really exceeded my expectations.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to those &lt;br /&gt;people who have tried everything else without positive results.</li>
      <li>It has a more liquid-like consistency than other lotions.  </li>
      <li>I use it daily and apply it to a clean face after shaving.  </li>
      <li>Not sure if it is as effective as they say regarding wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>A decent product from a well-known company.</li>
      <li>If Eucerin listed this warning on the front of the container under the Red Font SPF 15 Sunscreen statement instead of hiding it under a peel off on the back it would be more helpful.</li>
      <li>It works like a product many times more expensive.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Those fine lines that they&#x27;re talking about do seem lighter with the Eucerin (tested by making a surprised face and then seeing how long it took for the expression lines to fade).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
      <li>the most is it absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t cause me to perspire as I have found with other facial lotions, I spend a lot time outside and the  SPF protection is important</li>
      <li>Fortunately, this one has been working quite well on my strange and sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Use it everyday and have no problems with my allergy to most sunscreens.  </li>
      <li>Look in the lower right hand corner on the back of the 4 oz.</li>
      <li>Eucerin continues to make the left side of my face feel softer than the Garnier on the right.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always bought the regular Eucerin Facial Lotion in the past and have been happily using it for about 3 years.  </li>
      <li>so this product had a lot to live up to in order to impress me, and it surpassed my expectations.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any lessening of my lines of my face, but I also haven&#x27;t noticed any new ones either</li>
      <li>so maybe it&#x27;s preventing new wrinkles?</li>
      <li>I live in the South and it protects my arms when the sun is pouring through the windows of the car as I drive.</li>
      <li>I do this for about a month before switching to the new lotion, unless the new lotion causes a severe reaction.  </li>
      <li>this stuff is my new moisturizer.</li>
      <li>As a PE teacher I am always trying out new sunblock and moisturizers.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and oil free and it makes a great base under foundation too.</li>
      <li>If I ever run out of this lotion, my face starts getting blotchy and slightly red after several days, and I notice a huge difference.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, and I can even put this on my eyes.  </li>
      <li>My skin is super sensitive, combination, and very acne-prone, so I&#x27;m very careful about what goes on my skin.  </li>
      <li>The only sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t make my face hot.</li>
      <li>Keeps skin soft plus has spf 15!</li>
      <li>I recently developed very sensitive skin from a medication prescribed by my dermatologist.</li>
      <li>I have used many products before and all of them were so hard for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>It has kept my face soft without any allergic reaction.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin... and have been using this for years.  </li>
      <li>I have tried a variety of sensitive skin lotions including neutrogena</li>
      <li>My skin is sensitive and this hydrates, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and provides SPF.  </li>
      <li>One of the sensitive skin products that I can use on my face without irritation.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years on my sensitive skin and never had a problem.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say anything about the wrinkle reduction so early on...</li>
      <li>so far no change.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive, acne prone combination skin and am using differin gel....</li>
      <li>this was supposed to be for sensitive skin, but all it did was break out my face.  </li>
      <li>will help keep my skin looking young longer.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin really soft and does not irritate or make my skin itchy like the Cerave AM and Cetaphil Spf 15 moisturizer did.</li>
      <li>As far as the wrinkle prevention Q10 is concerned</li>
      <li>Burns my sensitive skin...</li>
      <li>I like it so far.</li>
      <li>I got this product because it has sunscreen, is for sensitive skin, and is an anti-wrinkle moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wait a few minutes to let it absorb on my face before applying makeup and my makeup goes on smoothly.  </li>
      <li>As far as the anti-wrinkle effects, I wouldn&#x27;t say it works miracles on all wrinkles</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve noticed the crows feet (I am 35 years old, after all)</li>
      <li>, my old lotion is Garnier Moisture Rescue for Normal/Combo Skin.</li>
      <li>had a breakout this morning as well, and noticed something unexpected.  </li>
      <li>Well so far i like how this feels on my skin</li>
      <li>its too early to tell if i feel like it makes my skin nicer</li>
      <li>This product is advertised as for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive acne prone skin with rosacea</li>
      <li>Nice soft lotion for delicate skin, but not a broad spectrum sunscreen (which I didn&#x27;t think to confirm before I ordered).</li>
      <li>I have dry, super sensitive skin that gets red and/or reacts (sometimes breaks out) to</li>
      <li>I cannot say whether this is a good product for other skin sensitivities, and products that make one person&#x27;s roseacea flare up don&#x27;t necessarily have the same effect on other people, but for me it was a problem.</li>
      <li>yet i have very sensitive dry skin, i don&#x27;t get much acne but do get KP on my face.</li>
      <li>It is more of a liquid consistency and a little bit goes a long way for application.  </li>
      <li>This is very moisturizing unlike the spf30 which I also have and has been great for the very dry cold mid-west winter.  </li>
      <li>i doesn&#x27;t take much so it lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>this is something you want to try, be careful to look for exactly the name as shown.</li>
      <li>It has few ingredients and is true to its promise: \\&quot;...</li>
      <li>Have been using it for years and in a very dry climate it&#x27;s really helpful to keep my skin soft.</li>
      <li>On the left, I use the new lotion.  </li>
      <li>I love this product and don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so hard to find in retail stores, but hooray for Amazon, they always have it - at a lower price!</li>
      <li>The creases around my nose have always had patches of dry flaky skin that would be very noticeable under makeup and nothing I tried would ever get rid of this.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it to anyone with sensitive, dry skin.</li>
      <li>The SPF is a major plus, but I even use it at night because I just like it as a lotion.</li>
      <li>Love this and very hard to find.  </li>
      <li>I tried a few other lotions and the breakouts didn&#x27;t get better, was splotchy and peeling.  </li>
      <li>I did notice that it made my skin very soft, which is nice, but that&#x27;s irrelevant when my face is tingling, red, and burning.  </li>
      <li>The way I switch to a new product is this: on the right side of my face, I use my usual lotion.  </li>
      <li>I normally use olay sensitive skin complete face lotion, but it just does not cut it over the winter months when my face becomes extra dry.</li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;m going to have a hard time going a full month without switching over completely, but I&#x27;ll try to soldier on, just in case.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall, I am happy with the product as it is very difficult for me to find a face lotion that doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out.</li>
      <li>It is barely a moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve spent so much to find the one for myself</li>
      <li>so I bought the Eucerin Sensitive Facial Skin Q10 Anti-Wrinkle Lotion, SPF15, and have been using it for about a month now.</li>
      <li>container, peel back the label as directed and read the Warning which states \\&quot;Skin Cancer/Skin Aging Alert: Spending time in the sun increases your risk of skin cancer and early skin aging.</li>
      <li>This product has been shown only to help prevent sunburn, NOT skin cancer or early skin</li>
      <li>My skincare regimen consists of using this in the mornings as mentioned above, and the Eucerin Q10 Sensitive Skin Creme, which is a thicker cream, at night.  </li>
      <li>I recommend this product to anyone, especially anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Difficult to find on a shelf in the drug store, but does wonders for  the place I liked it, on my bald head....</li>
      <li>I can smell the SPF ingredients slightly when I first apply the lotion, but it goes away soon thereafter.  </li>
      <li>, I put Olay Complete moisture lotion UV defense for sensitive skin on one side of my face and the Eucerin Sensitive Facial Skin Q10 on the other.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive and dry skin.</li>
      <li>But, for some reason, the Eucerin side of my face isn&#x27;t as broken out as the Garnier side, to the point where I have a very obvious and comical line down the middle of my face that marks where the clear skin ends.  </li>

<li> Love it!  </li>
<li> Great light lotion i noticed difference in mu skin after couole days of use.</li>
<li> you are purchasing this to wear under product, around the house/yard, or just for the benefits of wearing a light moisturizer/sunscreen, it&#x27;s great.</li>
<li> Summer or Winter, the moisture that this product provides is amazing.</li>
<li> Nice product, well priced.</li>
<li> The lotion is kind of greasy for my skin.  </li>
<li> A nice face cream.</li>
<li> A nice feature this product has is that it doesn&#x27;t leave that whitened look on your skin after application as a lot of lotions with sunscreen do.</li>
<li> I have always liked the products of Eucerin.</li>
<li> The product is great, but I might be able to get it more inexpensively somewhere else.</li>
<li> Excellent moisturizer for sensitive skin and absorbs nicely without greasy feeling.</li>
<li> But I was very happy with being able to find the product at Amazon at a reasonable price.</li>
<li> Love love it!</li>
<li> It seems to be doing a good job preventing wrinkles because they&#x27;re not increasing as fast as they might, but even more important is how wonderful my skin feels.</li>
<li> Tend to use it more in the winter though as it is kind of oily/shinny.</li>
<li> This cream is excellent for sensitive skin.</li>
<li> Best moisturizer with SPF for sensitive skin.</li>
<li> It is light on the skin and does not feel greasy but provides good coverage against the sun.  </li>
<li> They are perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
<li> very light, non greasy.</li>
<li> Whether that is true or not, it is a good thing because it makes me feel better about myself.</li>
<li> Q10 help moisturize your skin and reduce fine lines and wrinkles leaving you with a nice glowing complexion</li>
<li> I love this stuff.  </li>
<li> Now my favorite lotion-</li>
<li> help keep your skin healthy...</li>
<li> I love this and all Eucerin products I have tried.</li>
<li> This is a nice, light moisturizer.  </li>
<li> What more can I say?</li>
<li> my skin is soft , smooth , perfect</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m enjoying it.  </li>
<li> Light, but effective.  </li>
<li> Wish it gave more moisture</li>
<li> I have been using this lotion for quite some time - probably about 9 months now, and I absolutely love it.</li>
<li> I love that it contains SPF too.</li>
<li> This is my all time favorite day moisturizer with sunscreen.</li>
<li> This is one of my favorite moisturizers.  </li>
<li> Hoping for more as I continue to use it.</li>
<li> I love it.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin, and is not greasy like many products with SPF do.</li>
<li> i recommend the product you can buy it several times excellent bran</li>
<li> and you can be confident</li>
<li> and I love that it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
<li> Love this stuff.</li>
<li> I love it.</li>
<li> Fantastic moisturizer!</li>
<li> I love this lotion.  </li>
<li> LOVE IT,</li>
<li> LOVE</li>
<li> I have been using this for years and love it.  </li>
<li> Tried CeraVe facial moisturiser which burned my skin, though this one works wonderfully.</li>
<li> Light, effective.</li>
<li> I love this product, but I can never find it in the store.  </li>
<li> many products applied to my face.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m probably on my 10th bottle, because I continually use this stuff and am so satisfied I don&#x27;t want to try anything else.  </li>
<li> The Eucerin is thicker than the gel-cream texture of the Garnier, and while neither has an overwhelming scent, the Garnier has a stronger scent.  </li>
<li> Ok, I&#x27;ve hit my limit.  </li>
<li> i am hopeful that i am going to love this product i will keep you posted.</li>
<li> Look at the ingredients and you&#x27;ll see many known irritants.</li>
<li> /&gt;Again, it is ok as a sunblock, but not how it is advertised.</li>
<li> This is my favorite moisturizer.  </li>
<li> It is not always easy to get a good selection of Eucerin products where I live, so was thrilled to find them on Amazon.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll continue to use Eucerin Lotion on my face as I&#x27;ve never found anything else that is perfect for my skin type (oily t-zone, dry everywhere else)</li>
<li> After apply it, my face feels very smooth and light, and I do not feel any irritation at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I love this product it helps with fine lines and wrinkles</li>
<li> This lotion works great on sensitive skin.</li>
<li> Works great under makeup and doesn&#x27;t burn my sensitive skin.</li>
<li> Great for really sensitive skin.</li>
<li> Good lotion with spf and a reasonable price.</li>
<li> It really works and makes my skin feel so good.</li>
<li> /&gt;It has pump dispenser which makes easy to use, and it doesn&#x27;t smell any strong fragrance, the texture is very smooth and light.</li>
<li> This is a nice, light, day lotion containing adequate sunscreen protection.</li>
<li> so I get redness and irritation easily.</li>
<li> Easy to use under makeup.</li>
<li> is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t have any smell.</li>
<li> and it goes on easy.  </li>
<li> Easy to apply.</li>
<li> A bit oily and shiny as with most true SPF products.</li>
<li> It would probably be fine for this without sensitivity issues.</li>
<li> /&gt;Minimizes fine lines -</li>
<li> No visible difference in pore size, acne, or fine lines</li>
<li> My skin is calmer, my fine lines have all but disappeared, and it continues to make my skin softer than the Garnier moisturizer.  </li>
<li> This is fine as a Sunscreen lotion but the front labeling and description on Amazon is misleading.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t know if the anti-wrinkle aspect of it works, but I love the hydration of this moisturizer - adequate but does not make my combination skin greasy.  </li>
<li> This is the best sensitive skin anti-wrinkle with SPF lotion I have found by far!  </li>
<li> two huge</li>
<li> it&#x27;s light</li>
<li> Great product that can&#x27;t be found in my local drugstores.</li>
<li> the sunscreen in it is so important.  </li>
<li> Not greasy at all,very light weight.</li>
<li> This is a great lightweight daily lotion.</li>
<li> Moisturizes, prevents wrinkles, and gives light sun coverage.</li>
<li> Feels light and smoothe.</li>
<li> Scent free.</li>
<li> It does not irritate my skin or cause breakouts and leaves my skin smooth and well hydrated.</li>
<li> It leaves my skin silky smooth.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s not greasy, leave a smooth look.</li>
<li> Silky smooth, non-greasy, doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts, and it contains sunscreen.</li>
<li> silky smooth.</li>
<li> I truly does smooth out wrinkles (I am 52), and does so with a light, non-greasy feel.  </li>
<li> Maybe this product is great for some people, but definitely not for me!</li>
<li> My skin felt hydrated and smooth after I applied it, and it was immediately absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> A light dusting of face powder corrected it immediately, but it still gives me pause.&lt;br</li>
<li> This product glides on so smoothly and moisturizes so well.</li>
<li> I like the fact that it is light and soaks in.  </li>
<li> This is a light moisturizer.</li>
<li> Good moisturizer for sensitive skin</li>
<li> Anyhow, once they stopped selling it, I figured that Eucerin, being part of the same family of companies should be able to come up with a good Q10/spf alternative.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using Eucerin sensitive for years and have always loved</li>
<li> So far so good.</li>
<li> This cream has excellent texture and no strong smell.  </li>
<li> This is light and absorbs quickly.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s an awesome product that absorbs well and leaves the skin soft and younger looking.</li>
<li> This is a SUPER light lotion-</li>
<li> Goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.  </li>
<li> My mother and sisters are using this lotion more than four years and they are so satisfied with the Eucerin Q10 Anti-Wrinkle Sensitive Skin Lotion.</li>
<li> I think this is very gentle and good for some sensitive skins like me...</li>
<li> VERY good on sensitive skin, the scent is light to non-existent, provides sun screen, and I swear the Q10 actually does help with wrinkles given time.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m glad I can purchase them online at a reasonable price.</li>
<li> initial impression of the Eucerin is good--</li>
<li> It is not greasy and is an excellent moisturizing, anti-wrinkle cream with a good strength SPF for ordinary daily use that blends right into the skin.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Oil Free Moisture SPF 15 for many years but wanted to try something new.</li>
<li> Eucerin Q10 &amp; SPF: Quickly absorbs without  greasiness or clogging pores.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s non greasy quick to soak in moisture.</li>
<li> I have mild roseacea.  </li>
<li> Will remain loyal.</li>
<li> you see that this is simply a mild sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I was looking for a light daily lotion that would also provide sun-protection and be great on my sensitive skin.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s light but actually moisturizes, something I have found that most &#x27;light&#x27; lotions do not do.</li>
<li> This allows me to systematically test whether or not the new lotion is actually better, as well as control for hormone swings/</li>
<li> I have very sensitive skin, and i love this moisturizer.  </li>
<li> It is light and not greasy, but really moisturizes.  </li>
<li> This is my favorite daytime moisturizer, and I have tried almost every sensitive skin moisturizer (cerave, cetaphil, olay).</li>
<li> For sensitive skin, be sure that it says so.</li>
<li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not sweat resistant at all, it slides right off in humid weather</li>
<li> right before I put my make-up on.  </li>
<li> It is not greasy on the face and gives the right amount of hydration to keep my face supple throughout the day.  </li>
<li> Apply right after showering.</li>
<li> The price is pretty good comparing with other brands of the same kind.</li>
<li> this is NOT fragrance free it smells like normal sunblock.</li>
<li> Actually my husband uses it now, and it is really good for sensitive skin, like his!</li>
<li> It does kind of make my hands feel a bit dry after i run it on my face</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell at first</li>
<li> I, too, wish, that the SPF were higher, though.</li>
<li> sure wish Eucerin had a light and non-greasy daily lotion for sensitive skin with UV 15 protection.  </li>
<li> And this SPF 15 lotion makes my face feel so soft and smooth.</li>
<li> I can mix it with my make up for more sheer coverage.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over 5 years now and can&#x27;t find anything better, especially to wear under makeup.</li>
<li> My skin now feels soft and smooth.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s light, fast absorbing, and gentle on my face.</li>
<li> Will definitely buy more products from Eucerin.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used so many and always come back to this one as I always notice clearer, healthier looking skin.  </li>
<li> Love this facial sun screen, I wear it every day under my make-up.</li>
<li> This lotion is gentle and moisturizing--and I get sun protection too!</li>
<li> Feels lightweight and I like that the bottle is bigger than many face lotion bottles.</li>
<li> To make sure I wasn&#x27;t imagining it, I asked my boyfriend to tell me if he could feel a difference between the two sides of my face, without telling him which side was which, and he also said that the left side was softer.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
<li> Just beware that when it&#x27;s first applied to skin, it can create an unflattering effect.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m sure it takes much more time for anything like this to actually give visual results</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s the same great non greasy formula that doesn&#x27;t cause me any breakouts and keeps me from dry skin.</li>
<li> I am 64, and recently two young girls commented on my nice complexion...</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t help to much with my wrinkles but it was moisturizing and great for delicate skin.</li>
<li> SPF 15, for daily use, light on the skin, quickly absorbed.</li>
<li> A great, inexpensive alternative to much more expensive moisturizers!</li>
<li> , I was quite certain</li>
<li> The Eucerin absorbs more slowly, and doesn&#x27;t spread as easily as the Garnier, but the skin feels softer when it&#x27;s absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The Eucerin felt slightly heavier and was not as comfortable throughout the day to my sensitive skin as the Olay was (most suntan lotions feel like they burn to me -</li>
<li> This is first time I&#x27;m trying this brand since it got high ranking in Amazon.com.</li>
<li> I really see a difference in the appearance of my skin when I use it.</li>
<li> I have rosacea, and have a real problem finding face creams/lotions that don&#x27;t irritate my overly-sensitive skin, and sill work.  </li>
<li> Very moisturizing and has SPF as well.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles yet</li>
<li> Plus the odor of it was very off putting.  </li>
<li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed much in terms of wrinkles</li>
<li> My make-up foundation goes on much smoother.</li>
<li> I use it daily and really enjoy it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m yet to see what this does, delivery was fast.</li>
<li> I highly recommend it!</li>
<li> Using daily under light coat of foundation.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t care a whole lot.</li>
<li> I had so much hope for this product based on the reviews.  </li>
<li> I also really like Eucerin&#x27;s Q10 cream for night use.</li>
<li> but i really did want people to know that it has that smell and that that smell lingers throughout the day.</li>
<li> Prompt shipping, thanks.</li>
<li> It really exceeded my expectations.  </li>
<li> Highly recommended!</li>
<li> I highly recommend this product to those &lt;br /&gt;people who have tried everything else without positive results.</li>
<li> It has a more liquid-like consistency than other lotions.  </li>
<li> I use it daily and apply it to a clean face after shaving.  </li>
<li> Not sure if it is as effective as they say regarding wrinkles.  </li>
<li> A decent product from a well-known company.</li>
<li> If Eucerin listed this warning on the front of the container under the Red Font SPF 15 Sunscreen statement instead of hiding it under a peel off on the back it would be more helpful.</li>
<li> It works like a product many times more expensive.  </li>
<li> I highly recommend it.</li>
<li> Those fine lines that they&#x27;re talking about do seem lighter with the Eucerin (tested by making a surprised face and then seeing how long it took for the expression lines to fade).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
<li> the most is it absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t cause me to perspire as I have found with other facial lotions, I spend a lot time outside and the  SPF protection is important</li>
<li> Fortunately, this one has been working quite well on my strange and sensitive skin.</li>
<li> Use it everyday and have no problems with my allergy to most sunscreens.  </li>
<li> Look in the lower right hand corner on the back of the 4 oz.</li>
<li> Eucerin continues to make the left side of my face feel softer than the Garnier on the right.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve always bought the regular Eucerin Facial Lotion in the past and have been happily using it for about 3 years.  </li>
<li> so this product had a lot to live up to in order to impress me, and it surpassed my expectations.  </li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any lessening of my lines of my face, but I also haven&#x27;t noticed any new ones either</li>
<li> so maybe it&#x27;s preventing new wrinkles?</li>
<li> I live in the South and it protects my arms when the sun is pouring through the windows of the car as I drive.</li>
<li> I do this for about a month before switching to the new lotion, unless the new lotion causes a severe reaction.  </li>
<li> this stuff is my new moisturizer.</li>
<li> As a PE teacher I am always trying out new sunblock and moisturizers.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s lightweight and oil free and it makes a great base under foundation too.</li>
<li> If I ever run out of this lotion, my face starts getting blotchy and slightly red after several days, and I notice a huge difference.  </li>
<li> I have very sensitive skin, and I can even put this on my eyes.  </li>
<li> My skin is super sensitive, combination, and very acne-prone, so I&#x27;m very careful about what goes on my skin.  </li>
<li> The only sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t make my face hot.</li>
<li> Keeps skin soft plus has spf 15!</li>
<li> I recently developed very sensitive skin from a medication prescribed by my dermatologist.</li>
<li> I have used many products before and all of them were so hard for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
<li> It has kept my face soft without any allergic reaction.</li>
<li> I have sensitive skin</li>
<li> I have sensitive skin... and have been using this for years.  </li>
<li> I have tried a variety of sensitive skin lotions including neutrogena</li>
<li> My skin is sensitive and this hydrates, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and provides SPF.  </li>
<li> One of the sensitive skin products that I can use on my face without irritation.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years on my sensitive skin and never had a problem.  </li>
<li> I can&#x27;t say anything about the wrinkle reduction so early on...</li>
<li> so far no change.</li>
<li> I have sensitive, acne prone combination skin and am using differin gel....</li>
<li> this was supposed to be for sensitive skin, but all it did was break out my face.  </li>
<li> will help keep my skin looking young longer.</li>
<li> It makes my skin really soft and does not irritate or make my skin itchy like the Cerave AM and Cetaphil Spf 15 moisturizer did.</li>
<li> As far as the wrinkle prevention Q10 is concerned</li>
<li> Burns my sensitive skin...</li>
<li> I like it so far.</li>
<li> I got this product because it has sunscreen, is for sensitive skin, and is an anti-wrinkle moisturizer.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s.&lt;br</li>
<li> I wait a few minutes to let it absorb on my face before applying makeup and my makeup goes on smoothly.  </li>
<li> As far as the anti-wrinkle effects, I wouldn&#x27;t say it works miracles on all wrinkles</li>
<li> but I&#x27;ve noticed the crows feet (I am 35 years old, after all)</li>
<li> , my old lotion is Garnier Moisture Rescue for Normal/Combo Skin.</li>
<li> had a breakout this morning as well, and noticed something unexpected.  </li>
<li> Well so far i like how this feels on my skin</li>
<li> its too early to tell if i feel like it makes my skin nicer</li>
<li> This product is advertised as for sensitive skin.</li>
<li> I have sensitive acne prone skin with rosacea</li>
<li> Nice soft lotion for delicate skin, but not a broad spectrum sunscreen (which I didn&#x27;t think to confirm before I ordered).</li>
<li> I have dry, super sensitive skin that gets red and/or reacts (sometimes breaks out) to</li>
<li> I cannot say whether this is a good product for other skin sensitivities, and products that make one person&#x27;s roseacea flare up don&#x27;t necessarily have the same effect on other people, but for me it was a problem.</li>
<li> yet i have very sensitive dry skin, i don&#x27;t get much acne but do get KP on my face.</li>
<li> It is more of a liquid consistency and a little bit goes a long way for application.  </li>
<li> This is very moisturizing unlike the spf30 which I also have and has been great for the very dry cold mid-west winter.  </li>
<li> i doesn&#x27;t take much so it lasts a long time.</li>
<li> this is something you want to try, be careful to look for exactly the name as shown.</li>
<li> It has few ingredients and is true to its promise: \\&quot;...</li>
<li> Have been using it for years and in a very dry climate it&#x27;s really helpful to keep my skin soft.</li>
<li> On the left, I use the new lotion.  </li>
<li> I love this product and don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so hard to find in retail stores, but hooray for Amazon, they always have it - at a lower price!</li>
<li> The creases around my nose have always had patches of dry flaky skin that would be very noticeable under makeup and nothing I tried would ever get rid of this.</li>
<li> I highly recommend it to anyone with sensitive, dry skin.</li>
<li> The SPF is a major plus, but I even use it at night because I just like it as a lotion.</li>
<li> Love this and very hard to find.  </li>
<li> I tried a few other lotions and the breakouts didn&#x27;t get better, was splotchy and peeling.  </li>
<li> I did notice that it made my skin very soft, which is nice, but that&#x27;s irrelevant when my face is tingling, red, and burning.  </li>
<li> The way I switch to a new product is this: on the right side of my face, I use my usual lotion.  </li>
<li> I normally use olay sensitive skin complete face lotion, but it just does not cut it over the winter months when my face becomes extra dry.</li>
<li> I think I&#x27;m going to have a hard time going a full month without switching over completely, but I&#x27;ll try to soldier on, just in case.&lt;br</li>
<li> Overall, I am happy with the product as it is very difficult for me to find a face lotion that doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out.</li>
<li> It is barely a moisturizer.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve spent so much to find the one for myself</li>
<li> so I bought the Eucerin Sensitive Facial Skin Q10 Anti-Wrinkle Lotion, SPF15, and have been using it for about a month now.</li>
<li> container, peel back the label as directed and read the Warning which states \\&quot;Skin Cancer/Skin Aging Alert: Spending time in the sun increases your risk of skin cancer and early skin aging.</li>
<li> This product has been shown only to help prevent sunburn, NOT skin cancer or early skin</li>
<li> My skincare regimen consists of using this in the mornings as mentioned above, and the Eucerin Q10 Sensitive Skin Creme, which is a thicker cream, at night.  </li>
<li> I recommend this product to anyone, especially anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
<li> Difficult to find on a shelf in the drug store, but does wonders for  the place I liked it, on my bald head....</li>
<li> I can smell the SPF ingredients slightly when I first apply the lotion, but it goes away soon thereafter.  </li>
<li> , I put Olay Complete moisture lotion UV defense for sensitive skin on one side of my face and the Eucerin Sensitive Facial Skin Q10 on the other.  </li>
<li> I have sensitive and dry skin.</li>
<li> But, for some reason, the Eucerin side of my face isn&#x27;t as broken out as the Garnier side, to the point where I have a very obvious and comical line down the middle of my face that marks where the clear skin ends.  </li>
<li> Usually can find one very close but not the same.</li>
<li> The only con (and a really minor one), is that one pump isn&#x27;t quite enough for my face - I need about 1 1/2</li>
<li> product is not a Broad Spectrum sunscreen and although I should have know that, I didn&#x27;t</li>
<li> I have dry facial skin</li>
<li> My skin has been very clear since using it, and a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> Eucerin makes other lotions with similar names and similar bottles.</li>
<li> This skin cream is very light and thin, which concerns me a little because I wonder how much of the SPF sun protection I am getting with such a thin cream.</li>
<li> It smells strange because is fragrance-free</li>
<li> Noticed minor improvements.  </li>
<li> It seems I have unknown allergies on my face, especially, around my mouth and eyes.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this for a long time.</li>
<li> I have purchased this lotion a few times so far on Amazon and am just getting around to review it because I wanted to wait and see how my skin would react to it.  </li>
<li> Fast absortion without thick sensation.</li>
<li> It took me several weeks to get my skin calmed back down.  </li>
<li> I was right, and at 48, it&#x27;s been my secret weapon for youthful skin.  </li>
<li> and it&#x27;s hard to get just the right amount on the half pump.</li>
<li> My only complaint is I wish it had broad spectrum sunscreen and that Amazon did not sell it as an add-on item only.</li>
<li> I keep trying other products periodically, but ALWAYS come back to this.</li>
<li> but I do have slightly dry skin.</li>
<li> Eucerin usually has great lotions, but disappointed in this one.</li>
<li> /&gt;Makes my skin dry</li>
<li> dry skin</li>
<li> I no longer have the dry patches of skin around my nose, or anywhere else on my face for that matter.  </li>
<li> When you read the Active Ingredients label on the back of the product (which you cannot review in the online product description)</li>
<li> and I have used this product when I expect to be exposed to a limited amount of sun</li>
<li> this stuff contains alot of ingredients like three different parabens that are not good for &#x27;sensitive skin&#x27; as advertised.</li>
<li> It came in a small white jar, which they actually still sell in Europe.  </li>
<li> /&gt;The Eucerin side feels softer to the touch, and actually seems less greasy after a night of sleep than the Garnier side.  </li>
<li> I need to put on a little extra in the winter when my skin&#x27;s drier, but it&#x27;s not greasy or smelly (no noticeable scent), so I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
<li> I tried the SPF 30 facial lotion and it was too heavy and streaked when I sweat.  </li>
<li> My husband&#x27;s only choice for a few years now.</li>
<li> I have only been using this for a few weeks</li>
<li> I do take partial blame for not looking at the ingredients before buying</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time, and won&#x27;t use any other moisturizer on my face!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m sure this is from the sunscreen ingredients, but if you don&#x27;t wear much makeup, and don&#x27;t wear any sort of powder or foundation, it makes skin look terrible because it&#x27;s almost as if it magnifies every dark spot or crease on the skin.</li>
<li> Although this Eucerin Q10 formula is not heavy and oily like some it is also not light as it has a slightly oily feel with a little tac to it.   </li>
<li> I would have expected the Eucerin to be worse since it&#x27;s new, and I&#x27;ve not experienced an increase in breakouts from the Garnier as opposed to my older lotion.  </li>
<li> I no longer feel my skin tight or dry since using this.</li>
<li> The wrinkles are minimal or firmer, too!</li>
<li> but they would make my chin and sometimes other parts of my face break out in a rash.  </li>
<li> I was trying skincentric trial and then change to other vitamin c serum.</li>
<li> Something I can&#x27;t do with any other sunscreen product.</li>
<li> i did use a couple of other anti wrinkle cream with spf protection like neutrogena, equate.</li>
<li> I am only 28 but have a very few superficial wrinkles on my forehead.</li>
<li> I have sensitive skin and this product is the few moisturizers with SPF protection that does not cause an allergic reaction (at least not for me).</li>
<li> The only negative is that it makes my face &#x27;sheen&#x27;, which I think is a side-effect of the sunscreen, which seem to give me that glossy look, no matter what it&#x27;s in.</li>
<li> I can exercise and sweat (a little) and it doesn&#x27;t drip into my eyes -- other products have compelled me to leave the gym to wash out my eyes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I have less redness on my face and skin feels hydrated.</li>
<li> and I am not talking about the slightly oily texture</li>
<li> Also did not give me that slight burning sensation in my eyes that I typically get when I use spf moisturizers on my eyelids (even the ultra-light Purpose moisturizer with spf had that burn).  </li>
<li> around my eyes are less noticeable since using this.  </li>
<li> I like that it feels softer, yet less greasy, and the SPF and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a scent are</li>
<li> I like that it also has an spf 15 but goes on creamy unlike the spf30 which is a little thicker.</li>
<li> I have used it for a little over a year now.  </li>
<li> I have used this product for a few years.</li>
<li> I use this product everyday</li>
<li> I dont think it&#x27;s greasy or heavy</li>
<li> This lotion doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or leave it feeling heavy or oily.</li>
<li> I thought I was going to have trouble after my the face lotion</li>
<li> Prefer it to other lotions I&#x27;ve tried, but hard to find in the lotion form.</li>
<li> I haven’t had any irritations since I started using this one everyday for the past few years.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a very odd effect.</li>
<li> Usually I wind up having to wash off my face a few hours after putting on a cream with SPF.</li>
<li> But there is very little scent</li>
<li> Usually I get acne once a month or so</li>
<li> moisturizes, but not sure if it does anything for wrinkles.  </li>
<li> Not sure about anti-wrinkle, but smoother skin</li>
<li> Plus, the price is unbelievable.  </li>
<li> I am not sure it is the bargain I had thought it would be.</li>
<li> ill definitely buy this product again.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know why it is so hard to find in the stores now</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t know why it is so hard to find in the stores.</li>
<li> I have been using it for at least 10 years.</li>
<li> I wish it was at least a SPF 30</li>
<li> makes my face out way to thick for me  clog pores burns eyes dont like</li>
<li> I have used Clinique lotion almost my entire life, and when they recently changed their formula I started to break out terribly.  </li>
<li> now noticing a subtle difference in texture between the two sides as well.  </li>
<li> I have tried it for well over 6 months and have only had bad results.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m 63 years old, so this was an unpleasant surprise!  </li>
<li> Very hard to find on the store shelf.</li>
<li> and it did not make it worse.  </li>
<li> The breakout is actually worse on the Garnierside (both number and redness of bumps).  </li>
<li> (if you sweat), youre blind for about an hour.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, after using this product for two weeks my face began to break out in blemishes.</li>
<li> I have to say that I use this without fail every morning on my face,</li>
<li> have used very expensive lotions and Eucerin</li>
<li> Haven&#x27;t seen any results yet, but I&#x27;m not expecting any; I just need moisturizers, badly.</li>
<li> I would buy this product again too bad</li>
<li> Parabens are truly bad for the skin!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I really see a difference in the appearance of my skin when I use it.</li>
    <li> The best non-greasy moisturizer that I have ever found.  A great value for the price.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have been using it for years. Is not greasy, but moisturizes just enough. I keep trying other products periodically, but ALWAYS come back to this. I have been using it for at least 10 years.</li>
    <li> Now my favorite lotion- it&#x27;s light and I think it has made a difference in my skin!</li>
    <li> Purchased this on April 12 and it&#x27;s been 8 months but I still have some left. I have sensitive and dry skin. I use this every morning and have noticed my skin looks healthier and softer now. Usually I get acne once a month or so but I haven&#x27;t had any since I used it. I didn&#x27;t like the smell at first but it is no problem anymore. I am definitely going to purchase my second one soon.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by Consumer Report for wrinkles.</li>
    <li> It is barely a moisturizer. No anti-wrinkle effect. I am only 28 but have a very few superficial wrinkles on my forehead. Thought this should do but it did nothing but leave my skin oily. Won&#x27;t recommend that to anyone. The seller provided excellent packaging and very fast shipping however. That&#x27;s why I gave it 2 stars. Otherwise I would have gone with a 1 star rating.</li>
    <li> Use it everyday and have no problems with my allergy to most sunscreens.  Great product that can&#x27;t be found in my local drugstores.</li>
    <li> SPF works great and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Tend to use it more in the winter though as it is kind of oily/shinny.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few years. It has kept my face soft without any allergic reaction. The wrinkles are minimal or firmer, too! It has few ingredients and is true to its promise: \\&quot;...help keep your skin healthy...\\&quot; I, too, wish, that the SPF were higher, though.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews I decided to give this a try and I&#x27;m so happy I did. I have sensitive skin so I get redness and irritation easily. I&#x27;ve spent so much to find the one for myself but this just works great-! I have less redness on my face and skin feels hydrated.</li>
    <li> Excellent face cream. A bit oily and shiny as with most true SPF products.</li>
    <li> Not only does it moisturize, but stays even after the gym.</li>
    <li> A great, inexpensive alternative to much more expensive moisturizers!</li>
    <li> This is non-greasy and does not streak.  I tried the SPF 30 facial lotion and it was too heavy and streaked when I sweat.  This is light and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Eucerin facial lotion for quite a while,  And I love it! I&#x27;ll continue to use it.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Does it work? Who knows. I use it for sun protection, I do not exspect any thing elce from it</li>
    <li> I was looking for a light daily lotion that would also provide sun-protection and be great on my sensitive skin.  Although this Eucerin Q10 formula is not heavy and oily like some it is also not light as it has a slightly oily feel with a little tac to it.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In order to compare, I put Olay Complete moisture lotion UV defense for sensitive skin on one side of my face and the Eucerin Sensitive Facial Skin Q10 on the other.  The Eucerin felt slightly heavier and was not as comfortable throughout the day to my sensitive skin as the Olay was (most suntan lotions feel like they burn to me - although the Eucerin did not burn I knew it was there and I am not talking about the slightly oily texture but rather how my skin felt).   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I sure wish Eucerin had a light and non-greasy daily lotion for sensitive skin with UV 15 protection.  I don&#x27;t understand why not.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin... and have been using this for years.  I am 64, and recently two young girls commented on my nice complexion... I recommended this.. plus the sunscreen in it is so important.  I love this and all Eucerin products I have tried.</li>
    <li> Not greasy at all,very light weight.</li>
    <li> I had noticable difference in just a week! I&#x27;ve been using it for a year now and it&#x27;s an awesome product that absorbs well and leaves the skin soft and younger looking.</li>
    <li> This lotion works great on sensitive skin. However, I have been using it for over a month now and I don&#x27;t notice a reduction in my wrinkles. Overall, I am happy with the product as it is very difficult for me to find a face lotion that doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out.</li>
    <li> This is a great lightweight daily lotion. Works great under makeup and doesn&#x27;t burn my sensitive skin. I need to put on a little extra in the winter when my skin&#x27;s drier, but it&#x27;s not greasy or smelly (no noticeable scent), so I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, light moisturizer.  I have oily, blemish-prone skin and the Eucerin isn&#x27;t causing me any problems!  I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Odor indicates some spoilage.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Eucerin. It works. What more can I say?</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years as after shave lotion. Great product for men. Very hard to find on the store shelf. Usually can find one very close but not the same.</li>
    <li> my skin is soft , smooth , perfect</li>
    <li> Great for really sensitive skin. Didn&#x27;t help to much with my wrinkles but it was moisturizing and great for delicate skin.</li>
    <li> I wanted a light day anti-wrinkle cream for the summer, and this lotion is perfect. The price is pretty good comparing with other brands of the same kind. It smells strange because is fragrance-free I guess, but it goes away shortly.</li>
    <li> Great for your face. Moisturizes, prevents wrinkles, and gives light sun coverage.</li>
    <li> I normally use olay sensitive skin complete face lotion, but it just does not cut it over the winter months when my face becomes extra dry. The Eucerin Q10 lotion provides the added moisture I need without making my skin feel greasy. This stuff is really great!</li>
    <li> I have tried a variety of sensitive skin lotions including neutrogena but they would make my chin and sometimes other parts of my face break out in a rash.  This is very moisturizing unlike the spf30 which I also have and has been great for the very dry cold mid-west winter.  I like that it also has an spf 15 but goes on creamy unlike the spf30 which is a little thicker.</li>
    <li> I have rosacea, and have a real problem finding face creams/lotions that don&#x27;t irritate my overly-sensitive skin, and sill work.  This one fits the bill perfectly.</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday&lt;br /&gt;I have used very expensive lotions and Eucerin goes on just as smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Price is good.&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing I dislike about this product.&lt;br /&gt;The product meets all expectations.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, and i love this moisturizer.  It doesn&#x27;t break me out and it keeps my skin feeling great.  I have used it for a little over a year now.  I cannot find it in the stores, therefore, I have to order it online, and thankfully Amazon is the place to go for it!</li>
    <li> Nice product, well priced.</li>
    <li> Feels light and smoothe. Scent free. Works as promised.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for years</li>
    <li> My skin is sensitive and this hydrates, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and provides SPF.  Best option out there.</li>
    <li> The lotion is kind of greasy for my skin.  It leaves a tacky touch but it does moisturize somewhat.  I only use it for day time when I leave home.  At night I still use my Chanel regime which make my skin softer and non greasy.</li>
    <li> One of the sensitive skin products that I can use on my face without irritation.  A decent product from a well-known company.</li>
    <li> The only sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t make my face hot. Easy to use under makeup.</li>
    <li> Good sunscreen product- good preventive for wrinkles but I cant say that it makes any difference in skin firmness. Notice the use of the word &amp;#34;appearance&amp;#34; in the hype: reduces the &amp;#34;appearance&amp;#34; of wrinkles.  Good moisturizer for sensitive skin but dont expect any miraculous firmness.</li>
    <li> returned. this stuff contains alot of ingredients like three different parabens that are not good for &#x27;sensitive skin&#x27; as advertised. i returned it.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Eucerin! And this SPF 15 lotion makes my face feel so soft and smooth. Of course price is unbeatable!! Love love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years on my sensitive skin and never had a problem.  I combine it with Eucerin Daily Protection Moisturizing Cream for additional moisture and SPF protection.</li>
    <li> This is first time I&#x27;m trying this brand since it got high ranking in Amazon.com. It came fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has pump dispenser which makes easy to use, and it doesn&#x27;t smell any strong fragrance, the texture is very smooth and light. After apply it, my face feels very smooth and light, and I do not feel any irritation at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for quite awhile, I like it and the like the most is it absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t cause me to perspire as I have found with other facial lotions, I spend a lot time outside and the  SPF protection is important</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer for sensitive skin and absorbs nicely without greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a month. I dont think it&#x27;s greasy or heavy but I do have slightly dry skin. It goes on great with foundation.  I can&#x27;t say anything about the wrinkle reduction so early on... so far no change. It has not irritated my skin and it is semi-sensitive. All around a good product I would buy it again..</li>
    <li> Recommend it doesn&#x27;t make my face oily like a lot of lotions on the market. Built in SPF is awesome also.&lt;br /&gt;Try it</li>
    <li> great product.  very light, non greasy. and it is spf</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years now.  In fact, I started using it when Nivea, which along with Eucerin is part of Beiersdorf in Germany, stopped making their Q10 spf 15 facial moisturizer.  Some of you might remember it.  It came in a small white jar, which they actually still sell in Europe.  Anyhow, once they stopped selling it, I figured that Eucerin, being part of the same family of companies should be able to come up with a good Q10/spf alternative.  I was right, and at 48, it&#x27;s been my secret weapon for youthful skin.  It&#x27;s part of my daily regimen.  I use it daily and apply it to a clean face after shaving.  It&#x27;s all you need if you&#x27;re a guy.</li>
    <li> I have always used Eucerin Q10 I love this product it helps with fine lines and wrinkles this is a great product everyone should try it. Q10 help moisturize your skin and reduce fine lines and wrinkles leaving you with a nice glowing complexion I hope Amazon continue to sell this product.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s only choice for a few years now. Very moisturizing and has SPF as well.</li>
    <li> Good lotion with spf and a reasonable price. It does, however make my skin oily, but I will use it anyways to protect my skin and because it is inexpensive</li>
    <li> This lotion doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or leave it feeling heavy or oily. I thought I was going to have trouble after my the face lotion my dermatologist recommended was discontinued, but this was my second attempt and I&#x27;m enjoying it.  I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles yet so I cannot speak to the anti-wrinkle aspect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m never using another day lotion again.  This is what I have been looking for.  Light, but effective.  I have sensitive, acne prone combination skin and am using differin gel....so this product had a lot to live up to in order to impress me, and it surpassed my expectations.  I&#x27;m 32 and my skin is glowing like I&#x27;m 20.</li>
    <li> Eucerin Q10 &amp; SPF: Quickly absorbs without  greasiness or clogging pores.  I can mix it with my make up for more sheer coverage.</li>
    <li> Like it a lot hypoallergenic. Wish it gave more moisture but like it.</li>
    <li> Keeps skin soft plus has spf 15! a 10 in my book!</li>
    <li> this was supposed to be for sensitive skin, but all it did was break out my face.  If it gets at all in your eyes (if you sweat), youre blind for about an hour.  Plus the odor of it was very off putting.  Eucerin usually has great lotions, but disappointed in this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Eucerin sensitive for years and have always loved it&#x27;s non greasy quick to soak in moisture. I decided to switch to the Q10 version now that I&#x27;m nearing 40 (gulp) and I haven&#x27;t been dissapointed. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed much in terms of wrinkles but it&#x27;s the same great non greasy formula that doesn&#x27;t cause me any breakouts and keeps me from dry skin. I do feel like buying the Q10 version will help keep my skin looking young longer.</li>
    <li> This lotion is inexpensive, absorbs well, and moisturizes all day.  It has a more liquid-like consistency than other lotions.  Works well for combination skin, and doesn&#x27;t look greasy.  I can smell the SPF ingredients slightly when I first apply the lotion, but it goes away soon thereafter.  I&#x27;ll be going back to this lotion once it runs out.</li>
    <li> A nice face cream. Just about the only one I&#x27;m not allergic to!</li>
    <li> My favourite day cream. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 5 years now and can&#x27;t find anything better, especially to wear under makeup.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite daytime moisturizer, and I have tried almost every sensitive skin moisturizer (cerave, cetaphil, olay). It makes my skin really soft and does not irritate or make my skin itchy like the Cerave AM and Cetaphil Spf 15 moisturizer did. My only complaint is I wish it had broad spectrum sunscreen and that Amazon did not sell it as an add-on item only.</li>
    <li> Always a great product!</li>
    <li> I have dry facial skin so I bought the Eucerin Sensitive Facial Skin Q10 Anti-Wrinkle Lotion, SPF15, and have been using it for about a month now. My skin now feels soft and smooth.  The wrinkles around my eyes have visibly lessened.  My make-up foundation goes on much smoother. It seems like I look younger too, but that may be my perception.  Whether that is true or not, it is a good thing because it makes me feel better about myself. I recommend the product.</li>
    <li> I started using Eucerin products 25 years ago when my child&#x27;s pediatrician recommended it. They are all quality products that are consistently good for my skin and my children&#x27;s skin, and don&#x27;t cost a fortune. It is not always easy to get a good selection of Eucerin products where I live, so was thrilled to find them on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for quite some time - probably about 9 months now, and I absolutely love it. It&#x27;s lightweight and oil free and it makes a great base under foundation too. I love that it contains SPF too. A nice feature this product has is that it doesn&#x27;t leave that whitened look on your skin after application as a lot of lotions with sunscreen do. As far as the wrinkle prevention Q10 is concerned I haven&#x27;t noticed any lessening of my lines of my face, but I also haven&#x27;t noticed any new ones either so maybe it&#x27;s preventing new wrinkles? Anyhow, this is a very nice lightweight SPF that feels nice on your face and won&#x27;t break you out.</li>
    <li> moisturizes, but not sure if it does anything for wrinkles.  I think I look the same.  been using for about a month.</li>
    <li> Use this for sun protection and moisturizing under foundation and put some on the tops of my arms also.  Soaks in and doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen.  I live in the South and it protects my arms when the sun is pouring through the windows of the car as I drive.</li>
    <li> Does not work we as it described.&lt;br /&gt;Makes my skin dry</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if the anti-wrinkle aspect of it works, but I love the hydration of this moisturizer - adequate but does not make my combination skin greasy.  Also did not give me that slight burning sensation in my eyes that I typically get when I use spf moisturizers on my eyelids (even the ultra-light Purpose moisturizer with spf had that burn).  The only con (and a really minor one), is that one pump isn&#x27;t quite enough for my face - I need about 1 1/2 and it&#x27;s hard to get just the right amount on the half pump.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for my wrinkles.  It does moisturize well. Although I wil not be reordering it.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite day moisturizer with sunscreen. I don&#x27;t know why it is so hard to find in the stores now (hope it isn&#x27;t going to be discontinued). It does not irritate my skin or cause breakouts and leaves my skin smooth and well hydrated. I highly recommend it to anyone with sensitive, dry skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. It seems to be doing a good job preventing wrinkles because they&#x27;re not increasing as fast as they might, but even more important is how wonderful my skin feels. Almost everything irritates and/or feels greasy, but this doesn&#x27;t. It glides over my skin, without rubbing in. My hands don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re dragging the lotion along. I love this product and don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so hard to find in retail stores, but hooray for Amazon, they always have it - at a lower price! I use the subscription plan too, that&#x27;s been terrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is something you want to try, be careful to look for exactly the name as shown. Eucerin makes other lotions with similar names and similar bottles. For sensitive skin, be sure that it says so.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Oil Free Moisture SPF 15 for many years but wanted to try something new. Unfortunately, after using this product for two weeks my face began to break out in blemishes. I&#x27;m 63 years old, so this was an unpleasant surprise!  I returned to the Neutrogena and my skin has cleared up again after a week. Eucerin has a great reputation (I&#x27;ve used their body lotions without any problem) and clearly most of the users of this product are very happy with it. It&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this product is the few moisturizers with SPF protection that does not cause an allergic reaction (at least not for me). It&#x27;s light, fast absorbing, and gentle on my face. Will definitely buy more products from Eucerin.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite moisturizers.  I&#x27;ve used so many and always come back to this one as I always notice clearer, healthier looking skin.  Great price, too.</li>
    <li> Noticed minor improvements.  Hoping for more as I continue to use it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best product I have ever used for the price.  Results are immediate.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years.  It is not greasy and is an excellent moisturizing, anti-wrinkle cream with a good strength SPF for ordinary daily use that blends right into the skin.</li>
    <li> This cream has excellent texture and no strong smell.  It leaves my skin silky smooth.  I also like the sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This cream is excellent for sensitive skin. I have used many products before and all of them were so hard for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It the only cream I apply to my face. I love it.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, light, day lotion containing adequate sunscreen protection. I haven&#x27;t seen any miracles, but it provides good hydration and protection. The only negative is that it makes my face &#x27;sheen&#x27;, which I think is a side-effect of the sunscreen, which seem to give me that glossy look, no matter what it&#x27;s in.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream every day for years.&lt;br /&gt;Works well under powder.&lt;br /&gt;It just makes my skin feel good.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Have been using it for years and in a very dry climate it&#x27;s really helpful to keep my skin soft.</li>
    <li> Love this facial sun screen, I wear it every day under my make-up. It&#x27;s not greasy, leave a smooth look.</li>
    <li> Burns my sensitive skin... I tried it twice about a week apart and each time my face became red, inflamed, and burned.  It took me several weeks to get my skin calmed back down.  Otherwise, it seemed to be good moisturizer.  It would probably be fine for this without sensitivity issues.</li>
    <li> I think this is very gentle and good for some sensitive skins like me... It seems I have unknown allergies on my face, especially, around my mouth and eyes. I can not use some sunscreens at all because of that reason. Fortunately, this one has been working quite well on my strange and sensitive skin. I haven’t had any irritations since I started using this one everyday for the past few years. This one is one of the list from the recommendations from my Dermatologist.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Feels great. I like it so far.</li>
    <li> I have used Clinique lotion almost my entire life, and when they recently changed their formula I started to break out terribly.  I tried a few other lotions and the breakouts didn&#x27;t get better, was splotchy and peeling.  This lotion immediately calmed my skin!  It is light and not greasy, but really moisturizes.  The SPF is a major plus, but I even use it at night because I just like it as a lotion.</li>
    <li> I just want to say this is a wonderful product! Thank you, it was prompt also! Actually my husband uses it now, and it is really good for sensitive skin, like his!</li>
    <li> Look in the lower right hand corner on the back of the 4 oz. container, peel back the label as directed and read the Warning which states \\&quot;Skin Cancer/Skin Aging Alert: Spending time in the sun increases your risk of skin cancer and early skin aging. This product has been shown only to help prevent sunburn, NOT skin cancer or early skin aging.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not a Broad Spectrum sunscreen and although I should have know that, I didn&#x27;t and I have used this product when I expect to be exposed to a limited amount of sun thinking I would be protected. I&#x27;m posting this review to bring this to the attention of others that may be using this product as I did. If Eucerin listed this warning on the front of the container under the Red Font SPF 15 Sunscreen statement instead of hiding it under a peel off on the back it would be more helpful.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer with SPF for sensitive skin. I have tried all kinds of over the counter products and nothings works like this one. It doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin, and is not greasy like many products with SPF do.Very light and absorbs quickly, best to use under makeup. It has helped to reduce wrinkles, keep in mind that this product isn&#x27;t going to erase your wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Best price for the quality of product that you get.</li>
    <li> I have mild roseacea.  I got this product because it has sunscreen, is for sensitive skin, and is an anti-wrinkle moisturizer.  I used it for a week and stopped because it was making my roseacea flare up.  I did notice that it made my skin very soft, which is nice, but that&#x27;s irrelevant when my face is tingling, red, and burning.  I cannot say whether this is a good product for other skin sensitivities, and products that make one person&#x27;s roseacea flare up don&#x27;t necessarily have the same effect on other people, but for me it was a problem.</li>
    <li> good price good product good presentation i recommend the product you can buy it several times excellent bran and you can be confident</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a long time. It&#x27;s a great value and I love that it&#x27;s not greasy. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that moisturizes my skin without causing an &lt;br /&gt;alergic reaction....I highly recommend this product to those &lt;br /&gt;people who have tried everything else without positive results.</li>
    <li> Not greasy, and with some sunscreen.  Not sure about anti-wrinkle, but smoother skin yes.  Prefer it to other lotions I&#x27;ve tried, but hard to find in the lotion form.</li>
    <li> Love this and very hard to find.  Thank you amazon for providing it!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Don&#x27;t know why it is so hard to find in the stores.</li>
    <li> This has been one of the only products with an SPF that has not irritated my eyes or skin. Usually I wind up having to wash off my face a few hours after putting on a cream with SPF. This lotion is gentle and moisturizing--and I get sun protection too! It doesn&#x27;t make your skin overly oily like some sun protection creams do. I love it.</li>
    <li> Fantastic moisturizer! Silky smooth, non-greasy, doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts, and it contains sunscreen. Even though it contains sunscreen, I occasionally use it as a nighttime moisturizer. I wish the Eucerin Q10 SPF 30 sank into my skin like this one does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Perfect SPF for daily use&lt;br /&gt;Quenches dry skin&lt;br /&gt;Disappears into skin without leaving any greasy residue behind&lt;br /&gt;Minimizes fine lines - I don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles so I can&#x27;t attest to its performance there&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t clog pores or aggravate breakouts, even when I fall asleep without washing it off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not sweat resistant at all, it slides right off in humid weather</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a pharmacist. I tried it and love it! It isn&#x27;t oily while giving my face moisture and helping with those pesky wrinkles that show up at times. I use it daily and really enjoy it. It&#x27;s noncomedogenic too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m yet to see what this does, delivery was fast. I know of a fact that most Eucerin products are very good, but my mum is yet to use this, she&#x27;s still on L&#x27;oreal.</li>
    <li> silky smooth. I use it at night. Haven&#x27;t seen any results yet, but I&#x27;m not expecting any; I just need moisturizers, badly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a few weeks but it seems to moisturize well.  I like that it contains sunscreen</li>
    <li> Cant find this in any local stores. All the stuff in stores sell SPF30+..Dont want that.. This one is light and feels great!</li>
    <li> I love,  love,  LOVE this lotion! !! I have acne prone skin and it did not make it worse.  Plus, my family keeps telling me that I now look younger.  I&#x27;m 27 and they say I look like  I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for over 2 months and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever stop. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  I truly does smooth out wrinkles (I am 52), and does so with a light, non-greasy feel.  If I ever run out of this lotion, my face starts getting blotchy and slightly red after several days, and I notice a huge difference.  For some reason the stores in my area don&#x27;t seem to carry this lotion over-the-counter anymore (Eucerin--please put it back on the shelves); they only carry the \\&quot;Redness Relief.\\&quot; This Q10 lotion truly does the trick for everything:  wrinkles, redness, smoothness, blotchiness, hydration, etc., without causing pimples or a greasy feel.  It is the PERFECT \\&quot;DAILY-USE\\&quot; LOTION!  Plus, the price is unbelievable.  It works like a product many times more expensive.  I also love that it is unscented and also has sunscreen!  I will never use anything else.  LOVE IT, LOVE IT-- YOU SHOULD GIVE IT A TRY!</li>
    <li> I was trying skincentric trial and then change to other vitamin c serum. I develop redness and itchiness over my face. I used Eucerin lotion during the day and Eucerin cream at night religiously for three days. My face healed. I don&#x27;t know about the anti-wrinkle effect yet. But, satisfied customer here!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and love it.  It is light on the skin and does not feel greasy but provides good coverage against the sun.  I use it every day under my make up.</li>
    <li> I recently developed very sensitive skin from a medication prescribed by my dermatologist. Tried CeraVe facial moisturiser which burned my skin, though this one works wonderfully. Using daily under light coat of foundation.</li>
    <li> Light, effective. I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time, and won&#x27;t use any other moisturizer on my face! Will remain loyal.</li>
    <li> I am still using the product, at this time it is too soon to tell if it works for me. But I was very happy with being able to find the product at Amazon at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I bought this product on a whim because I have always trusted Eucerin. But, after I received it, I read the ingredients. At the bottom, their are 5 different kinds of Parabens. Parabens are truly bad for the skin! So why are they in there? Why so many! I will not use this product because of that. I can not return it either. Another lesson in life.</li>
    <li> Nice soft lotion for delicate skin, but not a broad spectrum sunscreen (which I didn&#x27;t think to confirm before I ordered).</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, and I can even put this on my eyes.  Something I can&#x27;t do with any other sunscreen product.</li>
    <li> SPF 15, for daily use, light on the skin, quickly absorbed. Wrinkles just happen. I don&#x27;t care a whole lot.</li>
    <li> I love this product, but I can never find it in the store.  I&#x27;m glad I can purchase them online at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Difficult to find on a shelf in the drug store, but does wonders for  the place I liked it, on my bald head....</li>
    <li> I had so much hope for this product based on the reviews.  I have tried it for well over 6 months and have only had bad results.  I saw zero reduction in wrinkles and, instead, this product caused a rosacea flare-up with acne pustules.  In addition, it definitely smells like sunscreen, which is not what I would call \\&quot;Fragrance Free\\&quot;.  Maybe this product is great for some people, but definitely not for me!</li>
    <li> I have always liked the products of Eucerin.They are perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this lotion a few times so far on Amazon and am just getting around to review it because I wanted to wait and see how my skin would react to it.  I have to say that I use this without fail every morning on my face, right before I put my make-up on.  I get so many compliments from people about my skin now! I have dry, super sensitive skin that gets red and/or reacts (sometimes breaks out) to many products applied to my face. The creases around my nose have always had patches of dry flaky skin that would be very noticeable under makeup and nothing I tried would ever get rid of this. However, this has all drastically improved since using the lotion! It is more of a liquid consistency and a little bit goes a long way for application.  It is not greasy on the face and gives the right amount of hydration to keep my face supple throughout the day.  I wait a few minutes to let it absorb on my face before applying makeup and my makeup goes on smoothly.  I no longer have the dry patches of skin around my nose, or anywhere else on my face for that matter.  I&#x27;ve never had an adverse reaction and it has no noticeable fragrance.  As far as the anti-wrinkle effects, I wouldn&#x27;t say it works miracles on all wrinkles but I&#x27;ve noticed the crows feet (I am 35 years old, after all) around my eyes are less noticeable since using this.  It does have the SPF in it so the protection from UV rays is an added bonus. This is the best sensitive skin anti-wrinkle with SPF lotion I have found by far!  My skincare regimen consists of using this in the mornings as mentioned above, and the Eucerin Q10 Sensitive Skin Creme, which is a thicker cream, at night.  My face and skin are loving both of these!</li>
    <li> My go to morning lotion.  VERY good on sensitive skin, the scent is light to non-existent, provides sun screen, and I swear the Q10 actually does help with wrinkles given time.  I&#x27;m probably on my 10th bottle, because I continually use this stuff and am so satisfied I don&#x27;t want to try anything else.  I also really like Eucerin&#x27;s Q10 cream for night use.</li>
    <li> I like this product quite well. I have very fair skin, and use SPF every day, winter, summer, spring or fall. I like the way this product smooths into the skin. I can exercise and sweat (a little) and it doesn&#x27;t drip into my eyes -- other products have compelled me to leave the gym to wash out my eyes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this five stars, except that when I purchased it in November (for bi-monthly delivery to start in February), I was quite certain the price I was paying was for two 4- oz. bottles, and not for just one. I am not sure it is the bargain I had thought it would be. The product is great, but I might be able to get it more inexpensively somewhere else.</li>
    <li> this is a great anti wrinkle cream. i did use a couple of other anti wrinkle cream with spf protection like neutrogena, equate. i like this one the most.&lt;br /&gt;it is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t have any smell. ill definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Great cream as a base on face every day. Absorbs immediately! Recommended by my dermatologist over 20 years ago and I have used it ever since.</li>
    <li> Feels lightweight and I like that the bottle is bigger than many face lotion bottles.</li>
    <li> Great light lotion i noticed difference in mu skin after couole days of use.</li>
    <li> My skin is super sensitive, combination, and very acne-prone, so I&#x27;m very careful about what goes on my skin.  The way I switch to a new product is this: on the right side of my face, I use my usual lotion.  On the left, I use the new lotion.  I do this for about a month before switching to the new lotion, unless the new lotion causes a severe reaction.  This allows me to systematically test whether or not the new lotion is actually better, as well as control for hormone swings/cycles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, my old lotion is Garnier Moisture Rescue for Normal/Combo Skin. The Eucerin is thicker than the gel-cream texture of the Garnier, and while neither has an overwhelming scent, the Garnier has a stronger scent.  The Eucerin absorbs more slowly, and doesn&#x27;t spread as easily as the Garnier, but the skin feels softer when it&#x27;s absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Day One**:&lt;br /&gt;The Eucerin side feels softer to the touch, and actually seems less greasy after a night of sleep than the Garnier side.  No visible difference in pore size, acne, or fine lines (yet).&lt;br /&gt;My initial impression of the Eucerin is good--I like that it feels softer, yet less greasy, and the SPF and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a scent are two huge positives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE: 8/1/15--Day Three**&lt;br /&gt;The Eucerin continues to make the left side of my face feel softer than the Garnier on the right.  To make sure I wasn&#x27;t imagining it, I asked my boyfriend to tell me if he could feel a difference between the two sides of my face, without telling him which side was which, and he also said that the left side was softer.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now noticing a subtle difference in texture between the two sides as well.  Those fine lines that they&#x27;re talking about do seem lighter with the Eucerin (tested by making a surprised face and then seeing how long it took for the expression lines to fade).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a breakout this morning as well, and noticed something unexpected.  The breakout is actually worse on the Garnierside (both number and redness of bumps).  I would have expected the Eucerin to be worse since it&#x27;s new, and I&#x27;ve not experienced an increase in breakouts from the Garnier as opposed to my older lotion.  But, for some reason, the Eucerin side of my face isn&#x27;t as broken out as the Garnier side, to the point where I have a very obvious and comical line down the middle of my face that marks where the clear skin ends.  I think I&#x27;m going to have a hard time going a full month without switching over completely, but I&#x27;ll try to soldier on, just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE 8/13/15**  Ok, I&#x27;ve hit my limit.  I&#x27;m officially switching to the Eucerin.  My skin is calmer, my fine lines have all but disappeared, and it continues to make my skin softer than the Garnier moisturizer.  I&#x27;m throwing in the towel on the Garnier--this stuff is my new moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is good product and I use it every day.  I have rosacea and my skin turns red at the slightest provocation. This moisturizer does not have this effect. I recommend this product to anyone, especially anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Well so far i like how this feels on my skin and i see no irritations yet i have very sensitive dry skin, i don&#x27;t get much acne but do get KP on my face. It does kind of make my hands feel a bit dry after i run it on my face so i am hoping it doesn&#x27;t have a drying effect on my face. this is NOT fragrance free it smells like normal sunblock. its too early to tell if i feel like it makes my skin nicer but i really did want people to know that it has that smell and that that smell lingers throughout the day. i am hopeful that i am going to love this product i will keep you posted.</li>
    <li> This skin cream is very light and thin, which concerns me a little because I wonder how much of the SPF sun protection I am getting with such a thin cream. But there is very little scent and it goes on easy.  Can&#x27;t speak to whether the coenzyme Q 10 actually does anything for my skin after just a month or two.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer. It&#x27;s light but actually moisturizes, something I have found that most &#x27;light&#x27; lotions do not do. My skin has been very clear since using it, and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This product is advertised as for sensitive skin. Look at the ingredients and you&#x27;ll see many known irritants. It made me broke out in rashes. I do take partial blame for not looking at the ingredients before buying so I gave it 2 instead of 1 star</li>
    <li> As a PE teacher I am always trying out new sunblock and moisturizers. So happy my husband and I ( he is a pe teacher too) found this. I put before bed and in the morning on my face and chest. It really works and makes my skin feel so good. I no longer feel my skin tight or dry since using this.</li>
    <li> This is a SUPER light lotion- I think it&#x27;s lighter than any lotion I have used in the last several years. It still seems to pack a lot of mositurizing in, though. My skin felt hydrated and smooth after I applied it, and it was immediately absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue with this lotion is that it leaves a white, somewhat-shiny residue on the skin. It&#x27;s not greasy, it just makes my face look as if I put some sort of white liquid chalky makeup on it and didn&#x27;t blend it in. I&#x27;m sure this is from the sunscreen ingredients, but if you don&#x27;t wear much makeup, and don&#x27;t wear any sort of powder or foundation, it makes skin look terrible because it&#x27;s almost as if it magnifies every dark spot or crease on the skin. It&#x27;s a very odd effect. A light dusting of face powder corrected it immediately, but it still gives me pause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are purchasing this to wear under product, around the house/yard, or just for the benefits of wearing a light moisturizer/sunscreen, it&#x27;s great. Just beware that when it&#x27;s first applied to skin, it can create an unflattering effect.</li>
    <li> My daily go-to lotion. I have sensitive acne prone skin with rosacea and this provides great moisture, sun protection, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. I like to think it is preventing wrinkles too. It is the only product I use under makeup during the day.</li>
    <li> I like the way this cream goes on, there is no odor, which is great, and I can wear under my make-up.  Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion, I used it every day and its been great. I see the difference in my skin. I would buy this product again too bad I can not find it in the store only online or I should say amazon since I purchase all my stuff from amazon.</li>
    <li> Prompt shipping, thanks.</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.  Non greasy feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!  Apply right after showering.</li>
    <li> Bough this on a whim and have been using it ever since.  i use it under my makeup.  i doesn&#x27;t take much so it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply. Fast absortion without thick sensation.</li>
    <li> This product glides on so smoothly and moisturizes so well. It really exceeded my expectations.  This is the best moisturizer with sunscreen ever. I am totally sold on it! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> My mother and sisters are using this lotion more than four years and they are so satisfied with the Eucerin Q10 Anti-Wrinkle Sensitive Skin Lotion.</li>
    <li> This is fine as a Sunscreen lotion but the front labeling and description on Amazon is misleading. When you read the Active Ingredients label on the back of the product (which you cannot review in the online product description) you see that this is simply a mild sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, it is ok as a sunblock, but not how it is advertised.</li>
    <li> I only recently started using this product based on the reviews here on amazon.  I like the fact that it is light and soaks in.  Works extemely well under make-up even in the summer humidity of upstate NY.  Not sure if it is as effective as they say regarding wrinkles.  I purchased it here because they do not carry it at my local CVS.</li>
    <li> This is a light moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t break me out which is great. The only downside is that it is only an SPF 15. I wish it was at least a SPF 30 so I wouldn&#x27;t have to apply additional sunscreen.</li>
    <li> makes my face out way to thick for me  clog pores burns eyes dont like</li>
    <li> Love it!  Sun protection without a mask like feeling!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only thing I use on my face these days. Summer or Winter, the moisture that this product provides is amazing. There&#x27;s no white residue, smells like nothing, and there&#x27;s no stickiness. Provides SPF protection. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month.  I&#x27;ve always bought the regular Eucerin Facial Lotion in the past and have been happily using it for about 3 years.  I decided to give the Q10 Anti-Wrinkle version a try.  I&#x27;m sure it takes much more time for anything like this to actually give visual results but I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference between this and the regular.  I&#x27;ll continue to use Eucerin Lotion on my face as I&#x27;ve never found anything else that is perfect for my skin type (oily t-zone, dry everywhere else) but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy the Q10 version if it costs anymore than the regular.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite moisturizer.  I use it on my face and hands after washing.  I&#x27;ve even gotten my husband to use it on his hands.  He hates &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; lotions, but this one rubs in well for him.  I buy several bottles at a time.</li>
    <li> Wonderful stuff @ great price. It soothes skin, my lips are always dry/chapped, Cream feels great. Not fragranced. Great product!</li>
