      <li>I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE PRICE AND THE DELIVERY SAVED ME OVER A DOLLAR</li>
      <li>It is a great product and he intends to buy more when he runs out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
      <li>Nice scent and good holding ability.</li>
      <li>It has a very pleasant fresh scent that reminds me of grapefruit.</li>
      <li>Sure beats sleeping with curlers!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I love this wax because it makes me look like a freakin&#x27; bamf!</li>
      <li>When I first started growing mine, this stuff helped wonderfully.</li>
      <li>and i love it!</li>
      <li>The Hold is great, and washes out really easily.</li>
      <li>It has a great hold and is really easy to use.</li>
      <li>It has a very nice smell to it and goes on easy.</li>
      <li>They now sell their own brand in a carbon copy package.</li>
      <li>Dries nice and holds the stache all day .</li>
      <li>results- Let the product warm between your fingers then apply.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s sticky so the hair sticks to your fingers when you try to make a nice curl&lt;</li>
      <li>The brush/comb is handy but has it&#x27;s limitations.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is nice when washing it out or getting it off your fingers but in the rain, humid areas, or an accidental beer or coffee on your stache sends you to re apply again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They stopped selling the product ( Clubman ) and started selling their own brand.</li>
      <li>Comb is a nice touch.</li>
      <li>Although the product has a nice smell, it just doesn&#x27;t work that well with my beard.  </li>
      <li>Holds up all day and into the evening and creates a really nice look for the moustache.</li>
      <li>Managed to pull one hair out but still nice addition to my comb / brush collection.</li>
      <li>Nice wax, holds well; nice smell....</li>
      <li>Holds well, washes out nicely.</li>
      <li>Works nicely.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m making my own wax now, but in a pinch this does the job.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery, the product is perfect for any color mustache been using this brand of mustache wax for 30 years.</li>
      <li>Customer Service is awesome, they handled my problem quickly and made things very right again....</li>
      <li>Good quality and easy to use.</li>
      <li>This makes it very easy to style and form your &#x27;stache and get all the hairs to stick together nicely.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
      <li>It washes out very easily</li>
      <li>/&gt;However it has a very strong lemon scent.</li>
      <li>Returning home I went to Amazon and found the original Clubman(at a better price) and am now a happy man.</li>
      <li>The comb that comes with it is a great useful tool in keeping the stache out of the mouth.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Perhaps if it came with instructions or tips, I would have liked it more.</li>
      <li>Great works I&#x27;ve always like this product prices right</li>
      <li>Thanks I love it a very good seller</li>
      <li>The wax itself has a fairly pleasant citronella-ish odor that fades quickly.</li>
      <li>Great product even for a first time user.  </li>
      <li>First time using mustache wax, this did a great job giving me the hold I wanted.</li>
      <li>Works great for me at a price I&#x27;m willing to pay.</li>
      <li>If this product works for you, the price is good and it&#x27;ll get to you quickly.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and rinses out with warm water.  </li>
      <li>There are so many waxes out there</li>
      <li>It was more like a lotion..</li>
      <li>I recommend it to anyone who wants to have a great looking mustache.</li>
      <li>I will buy more as soon as I run out .</li>
      <li>ok</li>
      <li>home: GO BUY FIREHOUSE MUSTACHE WAX (wacky tacky) from their website.</li>
      <li>The combination of my favorite eyebrow pencil and this Clubman Moustache wax is a Holy Grail beauty combo for me.</li>
      <li>Have used it many times before and it meets expectations and quality.</li>
      <li>The wax has a refreshing aroma, and trains the moustache well.</li>
      <li>Overall I am very happy with the product.</li>
      <li>I was going more for a Dali.</li>
      <li>It has a citrus like scent that isn&#x27;t too overwhelming.</li>
      <li>I WILL buy more.</li>
      <li>Perhaps it can hold like this, but it would require more than I</li>
      <li>When that happens a light application of H2O blends it all together nicely.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Maybe it was my &#x27;stache hairs, but found myself using more than I thought I needed.</li>
      <li>By the way, we need more guys to grow handlebar moustaches!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway</li>
      <li>My mustache had never looked better.</li>
      <li>Have never used a better wax than Clubman.</li>
      <li>The brown by itself works better than the neutral by itself, but (as I said)</li>
      <li>was a bit clumpy although the hold was ok</li>
      <li>Better yet if attended and brushed while its drying on the hairs it holds my moustache in place perfectly all day.</li>
      <li>When applied it makes you look like your mustache ate more for lunch</li>
      <li>matter, glad I could find it again ...</li>
      <li>but I need to use a lot more of this product than I do others I have tried.</li>
      <li>Have moved on to better waxes.</li>
      <li>Then I learned Clubman made Chestnut, which I bought and enjoyed.</li>
      <li>sure what they could name it</li>
      <li>If it would blend in better, I would give it 5 stars as the hold is great...even like the smell.</li>
      <li>nice scent, cheap price.</li>
      <li>Satisfied customers.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for a great product.</li>
      <li>most people dont know what they are doing (thats why they complain),</li>
      <li>Invest in a better comb if you like to comb your stache.</li>
      <li>Still works, but I have to scrape off the hardened end each time I need more wax.</li>
      <li>I recommend Firehouse Wacky Tacky instead.</li>
      <li>Great stuff, it really helped me wrangle my mustache when I was about to just hack it off.</li>
      <li>Many retail stores don&#x27;t carry this brand</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m better off using the hair wax by Axe</li>
      <li>The hold could be a bit better....</li>
      <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure how to keep the hair under control.  </li>
      <li>Works OK.</li>
      <li>I order this for my dad because he hasn&#x27;t been able to find it in the stores.</li>
      <li>This wax was perfect for my boyfriend who has been trying multiple mustache waxes.</li>
      <li>If if does hold, the hold will last a couple hours at best before your mustache is in your mouth.</li>
      <li>There are better products out there</li>
      <li>love the way it holds it together.wish</li>
      <li>they would make a more mlarger comb/brush.</li>
      <li>I used this until I got a better holding wax</li>
      <li>It is more of a paste then wax</li>
      <li>but I find I want to rub my face more often with this on.</li>
      <li>It does help keep the moustache looking a bit more neat and controlled.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never looked better.</li>
      <li>I used the wax on special occasions but the comb I use every day, its wonderful for getting my facial hair looking nice</li>
      <li>He has enjoyed using this product for many years and gets many compliments on his fine moustache.</li>
      <li>A dab of water and a finger smoothing softens it all up pretty good as well.</li>
      <li>Pretty good.  </li>
      <li>I ended up liking it so much, I bought my own!</li>
      <li>The wax is good but the brush disintegrated on first use.</li>
      <li>Pleasant smell and taste, holds up very well.</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply and holds OK.</li>
      <li>Ok, so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;ve tried that many different brands, just a handful - for more reviews of more moustache waxes you could see the UK Handle Bar Club&#x27;s site, which is a GREAT site and covers all sort of stuff for taking care of your &#x27;stache.</li>
      <li>He had never thought to get wax and thought it was the most thoughtful gift.</li>
      <li>Smells great and dries clear.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands and this is still the best!</li>
      <li>Though the comb is chincy, the wax is easy to work with.</li>
      <li>It goes on easy -</li>
      <li>It washes off your fingers easily, so you don&#x27;t end up with wax on your fingertips until it wears off.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Mustache comb included makes application easy.  </li>
      <li>This wax isn&#x27;t as easy to apply as a couple of others I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>This mustache wax is widely considered to be the best available.</li>
      <li>Works well, easy to apply.</li>
      <li>EASY TO USE....</li>
      <li>Otherwise she says it is too strong.</li>
      <li>The odor was too strong for me.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t as strong as I hoped.</li>
      <li>Not fond of the taste and strong smell compared to wax products.</li>
      <li>Does exactly what it should, I am much more comfortable and able to eat more easily without my whiskers in my mouth.</li>
      <li>The comb is pretty nice, though it reminds me of a dental pick.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s working out just fine.  </li>
      <li>My husband sports a handlebar moustache and uses this product to keep it in fine shape.  </li>
      <li>quick service  ok</li>
      <li>This was a great beginning moustache wax but as his moustache grew, it wasn&#x27;t strong enough to keep the hold.  </li>
      <li>Awesome pproduct just can feel a little oily on the skin</li>
      <li>So far the best wax I have tried so far.  </li>
      <li>so this is an important consideration.</li>
      <li>However, the light application does not keep them in place all</li>
      <li>If I can&#x27;t find that happy medium, I&#x27;ll be shopping for hairspray next.</li>
      <li>So until I find something else this is my go to with a light touch.</li>
      <li>This stuff is not waxy at all, instead drying smooth to the touch.</li>
      <li>I ended up finding something truly fragrance free on Etsy.</li>
      <li>The wax is fantastic</li>
      <li>I prefer the fireman brand, which is a lot stiffer and feels like straight up beeswax, but holds the way I need it too and the excess comes out nicely.</li>
      <li>I also really enjoy the comb that it came with.</li>
      <li>Hubby has been using it for several months now, has a nice handlebar mustache that I love, and young strangers often stop him to tell them what a great mustache he has.  </li>
      <li>We&#x27;re horse people, and the mustache looks great with his western hat and clothes.  </li>
      <li>Clubmans is fast, easy and stays strong all day, yet washes out of my comb and stash quickly under warm water (unlike some products that seem like oil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Does the job better than most for a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Wax in a tin is far superior to wax in a tube because you can carry it around for touchups.  </li>
      <li>Being right under my nose, It smells ok too.</li>
      <li>Takes a minute to get used to working with it but very worth it.</li>
      <li>, I followed my first order of one unit and got four more orders.</li>
      <li>that it has gotten significantly longer</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK for my first mustache wax.  </li>
      <li>The results were good - better than with Brown - but not quite my natural because it still covered up too much (which is the point,</li>
      <li>i originally got this for my boyfriend, who decdided to grow a mustache to see what he looked like with one.</li>
      <li>this was my first mustache wax purchase and i am satisfied.</li>
      <li>Easy to use, distinct smell</li>
      <li>The people selling it were great as far as getting it to me fast.  </li>
      <li>This stuff keeps my cookie duster tamed and smells pretty nice when I first put it on, too.</li>
      <li>It also washes out super easy, so again, good if you are just starting.</li>
      <li>Has good staying power but have to use more than expected.</li>
      <li>The product also has a very soft soap like smell which is quite nice .</li>
      <li>Therefore: I have discovered that &#x27;neutral&#x27; or white works PERFECTLY WELL for my needs, and in reality it simply dries clear or invisible in your &#x27;stache.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy, and use it in good health!&lt;br /&gt;-Jonathanr</li>
      <li>Clubman is the best wax out there, it&#x27;s just getting hard to find.</li>
      <li>Use it daily good product</li>
      <li>If you are just starting to wax your moustache, this stuff is good to start with.  </li>
      <li>and it is nice and soft.</li>
      <li>It lets your mustache still stay full</li>
      <li>This leaves the \\&quot;handle bars\\&quot; full and curling like I prefer and it maintains the shape all day.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Again, it is good for a smaller stache</li>
      <li>but  not too good for a larger stache...</li>
      <li>Somtimes I want my tips up, sometimes, I like them more straight out.</li>
      <li>To grow a good &#x27;stache, must do proper grooming.</li>
      <li>It stays white all day, which does not look good on a brown mustache.  </li>
      <li>The delivery was fast and know others that use this product and they keep ordering more.</li>
      <li>It was a fruity sweet smell but it wasn&#x27;t working for me.  </li>
      <li>There are better waxes out there if you want a real stong hold.</li>
      <li>Works ok, maybe I was hoping too much.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Decent scent which is important since it is right under my nose, that seems to disappear</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the hold a true wax, mild hold.  </li>
      <li>Good hold (much, much better than local pharmacy products) and decent price.</li>
      <li>It washes out of your &#x27;stache easily when you shower without leaving a residue, making it easy to get a new style in in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;6.</li>
      <li>When I first started growing my handlebar the clubman worked fine.</li>
      <li>I quickly noticed a couple of problems with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Seemed to perform adequately, thus...</li>
      <li>but it goes away quickly.</li>
      <li>I am a first time user of wax and am glad to say this product works exactly as I wanted it to.</li>
      <li>and this is a super product for me.  </li>
      <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>but I enjoyed the scent and the hold was decent.</li>
      <li>well (ok, so I&#x27;ve gotten a few containers that were more dried out, but if the seal is good, it&#x27;s nice and smooth and creamy).</li>
      <li>I had to mix them together to get the color right, which made the whole process a lot more work than it should have been.</li>
      <li>shipper was Wasatch Beauty and shipped very fast !</li>
      <li>The neutral wax is great for lighter colored hairs and blends down to almost invisible.</li>
      <li>Thanks for such an amazing product!</li>
      <li>First off, its not so much a wax but more so a paste.</li>
      <li>, I didn&#x27;t have to use too much to get the desired result, and the brush/comb it comes with made the process easy.  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply and doesnt leave much residue if you comb thoroughly.  </li>
      <li>It actually smells pretty good, and it is inexpensive</li>
      <li>product did a pretty good job, although I had hoped for a little more &amp;#34;muscle&amp;#34; and staying power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Tried this product and it really WORKS!!</li>
      <li>The comb is a cheap piece of plastic and I was very unsatisfied.</li>
      <li>comb and brush combo does an effective enough job helping apply the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This can&#x27;t even be considered wax, it&#x27;s a white paste that comes out of a metallic tube, kind of like toothpaste.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many clear and tinted brow gels/waxes in my time</li>
      <li>and it will be worth it</li>
      <li>My findings were that the clear (or neutral) version works as described for the most part.</li>
      <li>Still, worth the money.  </li>
      <li>Of course, anybody with a long enough moustache to require wax, you&#x27;re already pretty awesome.</li>
      <li>It was fun while it lasted though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but now I am mostly gray and use clear.</li>
      <li>However, for the price this is a solid wax that holds for hours, the brush/comb isn&#x27;t all that useful besides being an applicator, but its a nice bonus I guess.</li>
      <li>This is far better than using hair gel I&#x27;ve found and it lasts all day.</li>
      <li>But the cap broke, so I couldn&#x27;t keep the wax fresh inside the tube.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, these are good, but not great.</li>
      <li>The hold works fine for me, but then I don&#x27;t have handlebars or anything high maintenance like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Having used other Clubman products with good results, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  </li>
      <li>That is what wax is for right?  </li>
      <li>Washes right out with water.</li>
      <li>right outta the tube.</li>
      <li>Very classy looking tube , kind of old school .</li>
      <li>Good wax for someone starting out with a mustache as it&#x27;s not a straight wax and is more forgiving.</li>
      <li>This is a great product to start out with if your mustache is small.</li>
      <li>I think this is a great product for taming the beast that has been calling my upper-lip home for the past 9 months.</li>
      <li>I think a creamy wax (type type) is better for general conditioning and parting.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t mind spending a few more dollars, I suggest looking around for some quality waxes like Firehouse or Oregon Wild Hair, but if you need a good cheapie, this will do.</li>
      <li>This does help, but the hold isn&#x27;t real strong so he still has to trim the center area and just grow out the sides.</li>
      <li>Several of us use the same tube and fine that the hold is exceptional.  </li>
      <li>This gives me the ability to modify it if it didn&#x27;t come out quite right when I first put it on.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
      <li>When used right, wax does a more then adequate job of holding the shape of a moustache all day long (including a handlebar Stache)</li>
      <li>my needs, and in reality it simply dries clear or invisible in your &#x27;stache.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy, and use it in good health!&lt;br /&gt;-Jonathan</li>
      <li>I prefer Oregon Wild Hair Moustache Wax, or just a really strong hair gel like Got2b.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So when a locals store started carrying Neutral, I warmed and thoroughly mixed 2/3 Neutral with 1/3 Chestnut in a small container and came up with the perfect tone for me...just the slightest hint of color but not remotely artificial or covered-up looking.</li>
      <li>(has a kind of citrus smell), has good holding power, but can leave flakes (small white particles) in your moustache</li>
      <li>I had never waxed my mustache before, and was a little hesitant to become one of the initiated, but this product had good reviews</li>
      <li>Good little grooming item</li>
      <li>The scent smells like a lemon creme pie at first then disappears.</li>
      <li>it does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
      <li>I first used Clubman&#x27;s mustache wax because it was recommended by someone at a bar I went to.</li>
      <li>This is my first mustache wax and I&#x27;m very thankful I found it!</li>
      <li>My wife loves the stache ;)</li>
      <li>exactly where you want it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The wax is great and long lasting.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>This is my first time trying this product for my moustache</li>
      <li>This was the first moustache wax I purchased after growing my moustache out.</li>
      <li>It was enough to make me appreciate a comb&#x27;s function in grooming the moustache and desire to purchase a better one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>, however neither was it such an outstanding product as to make me a repeat customer.</li>
      <li>Product description claims there is no &#x27;unsettling fragrance&#x27;.</li>
      <li>Was my first moustache wax.</li>
      <li>Holds all day, even in hot 90 degree heat.</li>
      <li>It holds pretty well though, so I&#x27;m going to finish the tube.</li>
      <li>This is my first wax I have ever tried.</li>
      <li>I only wish they would come up with a better comb....</li>
      <li>This was my first foray into the realm of moustache wax, so take this review with a grain of salt.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different waxes over the 40</li>
      <li>This was the first wax I have tried.  </li>
      <li>I am afraid that I really cannot speak to how good this product is because I lost a good bit of mustache fighting a grass fire</li>
      <li>It makes your &#x27;stache pliable but it stays put exactly where you want it to.</li>
      <li>I have used these products for many years and the quality remains constant.  </li>
      <li>Exactly as described.</li>
      <li>This stuff lasts and holds my wiry stache exactly where and how I want it.</li>
      <li>Will be ordering more in the future.</li>
      <li>not as crisp an appearance as I want.</li>
      <li>Does the job, thicker/stays in place better than last one I tried</li>
      <li>exactly what you expect</li>
      <li>I think it does what it&#x27;s supposed to pretty well.</li>
      <li>I got it because I read some good reviews, but its a waste.</li>
      <li>plan to keep trying until I get the appropriate balance between a natural look and complete control.  </li>
      <li>It was very affordable and I recieved it very fast after purchase.  </li>
      <li>Another positive is that a brush/comb is included</li>
      <li>I think something that needs to be said in these reviews of mustache wax is that you need to buy the right wax for your particular stache.</li>
      <li>, the shipping was lightning fast and the product was exactly what they are showing.</li>
      <li>My moustache is pretty light colored, and when I use this wax, it is lightened even further.</li>
      <li>the brown mustache had a strong white layer look to it.  </li>
      <li>But after a certain point of growth, it&#x27;s lost it&#x27;s molding abilities.</li>
      <li>If you want your stache to stay in a certain style you&#x27;ll have to apply a lot of this wax</li>
      <li>I had very high hopes for this</li>
      <li>/&gt;Would be nice to have a little how to flyer with tips for newbies,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I followed all of the instructions they weren&#x27;t that hard, but still did not get any good results.</li>
      <li>Last throughout the whole day and has a light fragrance.  </li>
      <li>And now that I&#x27;ve trimmed off my mustache, I don&#x27;t have much use for this.</li>
      <li>Adding water can extend the working time, but too much water</li>
      <li>He mainly wants to keep it out of his mouth while he is growing it out.</li>
      <li>when I get up in the morning I comb the mustache out and gently shape it with my fingers.  </li>
      <li>the Clubman no longer holds very well</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s actually very nice.&lt;br</li>
      <li>NOT USE TOO MUCH OF IT.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much of this stuff to make your mustache do what you want it to do.</li>
      <li>Very inexpensive but does the job of keeping the longer hairs in order.</li>
      <li>Works OK but not very resilient.  </li>
      <li>Works really well.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Getting a comb/brush is a real bennie, too.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Well, it keeps my handlebar moustache out of my mouth for a whole day, and that&#x27;s about all you can say about moustache wax.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really like it though.</li>
      <li>Clubman wax works very well.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold very well either.</li>
      <li>Very good...keeps the strays in place.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This wax really didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
      <li>and it really works on my mustache.</li>
      <li>A harder wax (like the types found in metal tins) is better for stiffening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>you really have to rub it all in..</li>
      <li>This stuff works really well.</li>
      <li>worked very well, in fact it worked so well that my mustache attained a length my wife found it to be our of her comfort zone.  </li>
      <li>My husband likes the moustache wax and it works very well.  </li>
      <li>This did not help me much for my mustache</li>
      <li>Works as advertised at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Mission accomplished</li>
      <li>Wish I hadn&#x27;t paid $5 for this product, really doesn&#x27;t hold up very well.</li>
      <li>It works really well.</li>
      <li>Holds very well and no order.</li>
      <li>It has never lasted me through a whole day; I used to carry it around in my pocket so WHEN it stopped working I could fix my mustache.  </li>
      <li>Very sticky, held stash well</li>
      <li>REASONABLY PRICED ...</li>
      <li>and I really really tried.</li>
      <li>To maintain a good moustache curl you will need to reapply the product at least once throughout the day.</li>
      <li>It comes in different colors, which may be nice if you need to hide the white hairs or make them darker.</li>
      <li>Not very expensive, reasonable hold.</li>
      <li>First of all the comb is super cheap and broke after a few times use.  </li>
      <li>I live in a hot city</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think any other product would have a good hold without feeling similar.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line it has helped keep my mustache out of my mouth when eating, I would buy it again, but I may also want to experiment with one or two other products to see if they might do the job better.</li>
      <li>Yet, she does like it much better than some other waxes I have used.</li>
      <li>I rely on this more than any of the other waxes and creams I have purchased.  </li>
      <li>I bet that many a man will find clubman wax more than satisfying, but if you have very thick, coarse facial hair, clubman may not be up to the challenge.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an old fart who is growing out a real mustache fro the first time after 40 years of a trimmed one.</li>
      <li>I read a series of good reviews for this wax, and after trying it for a week, I have to give it a big thumbs down.</li>
      <li>At 65 years old, this is my first handlebar moustache.  </li>
      <li>and if your stache is dark, its a bit more noticeable.</li>
      <li>Probably works as intended, but it stays pretty soft, and as a result does not provide a lot of control for shaping.  </li>
      <li>Sure a little goes a long way but it would be nice to have a bigger container.</li>
      <li>and as we all spend a fair amount of time talking and eating you do want your mustache to have a little flexibility --- so as I mentioned above, I do recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I have used this product before and this tube is better than I got previously.</li>
      <li>A decent amount of hold for your mustache.</li>
      <li>This wax is a classic.</li>
      <li>If you want a decent wax try something else.</li>
      <li>This stuff holds tight and does a better job of holding onto those racally hairs around the lips.  </li>
      <li>With the black wax, and I&#x27;m sure with the other colors as well, it stains your fingers [but can be easily washed out], towels, etc.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend to any moustached friend</li>
      <li>a high note</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>, I would highly recommend this product for your moustache.</li>
      <li>While most other mustache waxes make you look like an 1890s wannabe, clubman, used judiciously, allows you to style your stache while keeping a natural, us waxed look.</li>
      <li>It is more greasy than waxy, so it did little to hold my moustache in place.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t purchase it for the comb of course, but thought it&#x27;d come with something a little more sturdy.</li>
      <li>(I was growing a handlebar), it really is like not stiff.</li>
      <li>The wax goes on easy, tends to dull the hair a little bit, but if you work it enough, it looks great.</li>
      <li>We ordered the clear color and it works very well for my fianc&amp;eacute; to style his handlebar mustache.</li>
      <li>I got this a few days ago and each day my handlebar looks better.</li>
      <li>The comb does a fair job of blending it into your &#x27;stache, but it pulls your hair and is irritating quickly.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Its holds pretty strong and you do not need very much at all but does leave a little bit of residue (does not dry completely clear).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just not available locally so I am glad to have a new source.</li>
      <li>Although the black wax had a nice color to it, next time I will buy the neutral.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is great, doesn&#x27;t last very long and reminds me slightly of lavender.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t break me out and is so much cheaper and accessible than other clear eyebrow waxes/</li>
      <li>Live and learn.</li>
      <li>bought for my husband who is new to the handle bar world.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
      <li>The only reason I got it online is because where I live you really can&#x27;t find much of anything.</li>
      <li>Next time I&#x27;ll buy the tinted kind because sometimes it can dry white.</li>
      <li>This wax keeps my unruly brows in place all day without the stiff hold or flaking off like so many clear eyebrow gels.  </li>
      <li>Also, while applying I don&#x27;t really use the comb and just apply a small amount to my fingers and even it through, which results the dye to rub/smear onto my skin, which is easily removed, but still a hassle.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, I usually do not use anything with a fragrance, but for this quality wax, I do not mind bending my rule!&lt;br /&gt;DO</li>
      <li>But shipping, put a per tube price a bit higher than when I could by it locally.</li>
      <li>It is most likely due to the nature of white/silver hairs.  </li>
      <li>and I work outside in the hot west Texas sun.</li>
      <li>Several teeth broke out of the comb in the first week.</li>
      <li>The only problem I have is the smell when you first put it on.</li>
      <li>I have a pretty coarse moustache, and to get this wax to even begin to hold I have to use about an 8th of the tube, and if I manage to get it</li>
      <li>Ive had a handlebar moustache off and on for the past 20yrs and Clubman is my favorite wax.</li>
      <li>Others are not quite so strong a hold, and adding a little water to the fingers when applying makes the hold stronger still.</li>
      <li>cause it was taking too long to get it just right.</li>
      <li>It goes on easily and dries with a firm hold.  </li>
      <li>you decided to finally become a true man and grow out your facial</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a strong citrusy smell to me but it does wear off after a few minutes.</li>
      <li>Anyhow, it has a moderate hold (not great) and smells kind of funny.  </li>
      <li>The wax is more like a hard paste that can be difficult to squeeze from the tube unless you warm it between your hands first.</li>
      <li>It only held for half of the day, then I had to reapply more, and then it would be a bit goopy (unless there is a trick</li>
      <li>brush missing a clump of bristles, otherwise fine.</li>
      <li>Used in large amounts, it is visibly white.</li>
      <li>The caveat is that you need to make sure to use as little as possible.</li>
      <li>The label says it is clear.</li>
      <li>Having used Clubman Moustache Wax for ages I was surprised to discover,a day before a vacation trip,that CVS no longer carried it.</li>
      <li>I have a modified 3 musketeer type mustache, which is extremely long, needing a lot of hold under hot conditions.  </li>
      <li>if you want to look old school, this wrote the textbook.</li>
      <li>My husband likes it very much, it last all day and still will wash out very well</li>
      <li>We are using on my old man&#x27;s wild eyebrow.  </li>
      <li>The stood up and had a wild and unkempt look</li>
      <li>My &#x27;stache is unruly to the max; looks like an overgrown thicket gone wild.</li>
      <li>I will stick with natural look.</li>
      <li>But Clubman is so far working well for me to part a growing bushy stache until it gets long-enough to create a handlebar shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>About a year ago I asked my husband to grow his mustache out into a handlebar that curls up a the ends -- old fashioned, but then we&#x27;re senior citizens.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had a handle bar for almost 4 years as such I have purchased Clubman&#x27;s several times, only because it is readily available.  </li>
      <li>it leaves a white film if you have darker hair, unless you really work it in there.</li>
      <li>The only thing I could think of was to twist&lt;br /&gt;it up on the ends until it started to really grow out.</li>
      <li>First, unless you have white facial hair, don&#x27;t buy \\&quot;neutral\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>Compared to other products this is pretty good stuff, but it&#x27;s not perfect.</li>
      <li>The little brush is cool.</li>
      <li>The Clubman Moustache Wax (Neutral) is exactly what I expected from this company.</li>
      <li>Feels pretty thick at first and looked like it was going to frost my hair, but once it fully dries it is clear.</li>
      <li>so it washes out in a second, but doesn&#x27;t drip out when under normal use.</li>
      <li>(Anastasia, Tweezerman, Maybelline, Revlon, Ardell, Dior, Shu Uemura, Smashbox, Becca, etc), some being total misses (stiffness, flakey, shiny look) and others have been good but far too expensive.  </li>
      <li>When it dries, it provides a solid, if not HARD setting for your &#x27;stache.</li>
      <li>I am writing this without having used mustache wax before, but it clumped up easily and was hard to use.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold very well or for very long.  </li>
      <li>It is a very inexpensive item and it keeps hold for a very long time.</li>
      <li>if you put to much it leave white residue not enough hold</li>
      <li>Does the job, but the neutral one is white and remains white on your mustache, you have to really brush it in or use your fingers to try and blend it in.</li>
      <li>I need something at least as strong as this Clubman to hold the moustache, but I don&#x27;t like the way the hairs feel glued to my face.  </li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t have any major issues that would prevent me from using this product again</li>
      <li>No other product works as well for me.</li>
      <li>It held well and did its job when no other wax probably would.  </li>
      <li>For a long time the only Clubman wax locally available was Brown, which is too dark for my mixed color &#x27;stache (dark brown, light brown, red and gray).</li>
      <li>The little comb is useful for pre-grooming.</li>
      <li>The little brush is useful.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just not stiff enough for me.</li>
      <li>Got this for my boyfriend as sort of a gag gift and he loves it and ended up using it a lot to calm down those mustache hairs!</li>
      <li>This is probably just a result of wax in general</li>
      <li>The neutral color is initially white, but dries clear.</li>
      <li>I am still learning to use it properly, but so far - no problems.  </li>
      <li>only problem is if u dont comb out enough leaves white globs and by combing too much</li>
      <li>, it will barely hold for an hour.</li>
      <li>The scent is nice, almost fruity, but incredibly faint.</li>
      <li>The back of the included brush makes a better hole in the end of the tube than the point on the cap does; other than that, I don&#x27;t use the little brush.</li>
      <li>I prefer hard heat per use waxes, but if you want something fast choose pretty much any other semi-firm wax.  </li>
      <li>The brown is too dark and the &amp;#34;neutral&amp;#34; will definitely turn your mustache white--I had to buy the brown and the neutral and mix them together in order to get the color right.</li>
      <li>made all my curly mustache dreams come true, works extremely well, hardens fast, and help up a curled stache through 3 hours of a heavy dubstep show that i walked away from entirely drenched</li>
      <li>Even in small amounts, the \\&quot;neutral\\&quot; color never seems to blend properly into my light brown facial hair.</li>
      <li>Since this is the first time I tried training my moustache, I have little to go on except this Clubman wax and the beeswax that I used.  </li>
      <li>, if I put too much on I can see it in my hair (which is a dark brown).</li>
      <li>Really plasters down the moustache  </li>
      <li>only useful thing I got out of it was the small brush.</li>
      <li>I found this to be false, there was a strong fragrance to it that gave me a headache (lemon-ish smell).</li>
      <li>Even being careful by holding it very near the comb itself</li>
      <li>/&gt;The comb that comes with Clubman is weak and cheap.</li>
      <li>Like other reviews, I would say its main benefit is lack of taste, firm but not too stiff and easily washed out (or off).</li>
      <li>My only complaint is mild flaking if used generously, and any moisture destroys the hold.</li>
      <li>This goes on soft and easy with very little work and then after about 15 to 30 seconds it sets and you have a very firm but still pliable hold.</li>
      <li>My eyebrows are black and the &#x27;natural&#x27; color applies clear without giving a wet look - my brows just look natural.</li>
      <li>I will say however that the Rite Aid kit came with a much nicer little comb and a pair of scissors though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> Good stuff</li>
<li> I get a lot of compliments on my &#x27;stache and a lot of questions on how I keep it looking good.  </li>

<li> all in all good for price.. dont know if id purchase again...</li>
<li> And smells as good as anything ever smelled.</li>
<li> Good hold throughout the day.</li>
<li> It does not leave a gooy feel but still helps maintain body and smells good.</li>
<li> GOOD TUBE OF WAX...</li>
<li> Works good but seems to have impurities in the product.  </li>
<li> It does a good job of training my mustache to be combed.</li>
<li> Works good, smells good, Is good.</li>
<li> I found it kind of pleasant.</li>
<li> Works great and smells like honey : )</li>
<li> I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE PRICE AND THE DELIVERY SAVED ME OVER A DOLLAR</li>
<li> It is a great product and he intends to buy more when he runs out.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
<li> Nice scent and good holding ability.</li>
<li> It has a very pleasant fresh scent that reminds me of grapefruit.</li>
<li> Sure beats sleeping with curlers!</li>
<li> I love it!</li>
<li> I love this wax because it makes me look like a freakin&#x27; bamf!</li>
<li> When I first started growing mine, this stuff helped wonderfully.</li>
<li> and i love it!</li>
<li> The Hold is great, and washes out really easily.</li>
<li> It has a great hold and is really easy to use.</li>
<li> It has a very nice smell to it and goes on easy.</li>
<li> They now sell their own brand in a carbon copy package.</li>
<li> Dries nice and holds the stache all day .</li>
<li> results- Let the product warm between your fingers then apply.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s sticky so the hair sticks to your fingers when you try to make a nice curl&lt;</li>
<li> The brush/comb is handy but has it&#x27;s limitations.  </li>
<li> /&gt;It is nice when washing it out or getting it off your fingers but in the rain, humid areas, or an accidental beer or coffee on your stache sends you to re apply again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> They stopped selling the product ( Clubman ) and started selling their own brand.</li>
<li> Comb is a nice touch.</li>
<li> Although the product has a nice smell, it just doesn&#x27;t work that well with my beard.  </li>
<li> Holds up all day and into the evening and creates a really nice look for the moustache.</li>
<li> Managed to pull one hair out but still nice addition to my comb / brush collection.</li>
<li> Nice wax, holds well; nice smell....</li>
<li> Holds well, washes out nicely.</li>
<li> Works nicely.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m making my own wax now, but in a pinch this does the job.</li>
<li> Fast delivery, the product is perfect for any color mustache been using this brand of mustache wax for 30 years.</li>
<li> Customer Service is awesome, they handled my problem quickly and made things very right again....</li>
<li> Good quality and easy to use.</li>
<li> This makes it very easy to style and form your &#x27;stache and get all the hairs to stick together nicely.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
<li> It washes out very easily</li>
<li> /&gt;However it has a very strong lemon scent.</li>
<li> Returning home I went to Amazon and found the original Clubman(at a better price) and am now a happy man.</li>
<li> The comb that comes with it is a great useful tool in keeping the stache out of the mouth.</li>
<li> /&gt;Perhaps if it came with instructions or tips, I would have liked it more.</li>
<li> Great works I&#x27;ve always like this product prices right</li>
<li> Thanks I love it a very good seller</li>
<li> The wax itself has a fairly pleasant citronella-ish odor that fades quickly.</li>
<li> Great product even for a first time user.  </li>
<li> First time using mustache wax, this did a great job giving me the hold I wanted.</li>
<li> Works great for me at a price I&#x27;m willing to pay.</li>
<li> If this product works for you, the price is good and it&#x27;ll get to you quickly.</li>
<li> It is easy to use and rinses out with warm water.  </li>
<li> There are so many waxes out there</li>
<li> It was more like a lotion..</li>
<li> I recommend it to anyone who wants to have a great looking mustache.</li>
<li> I will buy more as soon as I run out .</li>
<li> ok</li>
<li> home: GO BUY FIREHOUSE MUSTACHE WAX (wacky tacky) from their website.</li>
<li> The combination of my favorite eyebrow pencil and this Clubman Moustache wax is a Holy Grail beauty combo for me.</li>
<li> Have used it many times before and it meets expectations and quality.</li>
<li> The wax has a refreshing aroma, and trains the moustache well.</li>
<li> Overall I am very happy with the product.</li>
<li> I was going more for a Dali.</li>
<li> It has a citrus like scent that isn&#x27;t too overwhelming.</li>
<li> I WILL buy more.</li>
<li> Perhaps it can hold like this, but it would require more than I</li>
<li> When that happens a light application of H2O blends it all together nicely.</li>
<li> I love this product.</li>
<li> Maybe it was my &#x27;stache hairs, but found myself using more than I thought I needed.</li>
<li> By the way, we need more guys to grow handlebar moustaches!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway</li>
<li> My mustache had never looked better.</li>
<li> Have never used a better wax than Clubman.</li>
<li> The brown by itself works better than the neutral by itself, but (as I said)</li>
<li> was a bit clumpy although the hold was ok</li>
<li> Better yet if attended and brushed while its drying on the hairs it holds my moustache in place perfectly all day.</li>
<li> When applied it makes you look like your mustache ate more for lunch</li>
<li> matter, glad I could find it again ...</li>
<li> but I need to use a lot more of this product than I do others I have tried.</li>
<li> Have moved on to better waxes.</li>
<li> Then I learned Clubman made Chestnut, which I bought and enjoyed.</li>
<li> sure what they could name it</li>
<li> If it would blend in better, I would give it 5 stars as the hold is great...even like the smell.</li>
<li> nice scent, cheap price.</li>
<li> Satisfied customers.  </li>
<li> Thanks for a great product.</li>
<li> most people dont know what they are doing (thats why they complain),</li>
<li> Invest in a better comb if you like to comb your stache.</li>
<li> Still works, but I have to scrape off the hardened end each time I need more wax.</li>
<li> I recommend Firehouse Wacky Tacky instead.</li>
<li> Great stuff, it really helped me wrangle my mustache when I was about to just hack it off.</li>
<li> Many retail stores don&#x27;t carry this brand</li>
<li> I&#x27;m better off using the hair wax by Axe</li>
<li> The hold could be a bit better....</li>
<li> and I wasn&#x27;t sure how to keep the hair under control.  </li>
<li> Works OK.</li>
<li> I order this for my dad because he hasn&#x27;t been able to find it in the stores.</li>
<li> This wax was perfect for my boyfriend who has been trying multiple mustache waxes.</li>
<li> If if does hold, the hold will last a couple hours at best before your mustache is in your mouth.</li>
<li> There are better products out there</li>
<li> love the way it holds it together.wish</li>
<li> they would make a more mlarger comb/brush.</li>
<li> I used this until I got a better holding wax</li>
<li> It is more of a paste then wax</li>
<li> but I find I want to rub my face more often with this on.</li>
<li> It does help keep the moustache looking a bit more neat and controlled.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never looked better.</li>
<li> I used the wax on special occasions but the comb I use every day, its wonderful for getting my facial hair looking nice</li>
<li> He has enjoyed using this product for many years and gets many compliments on his fine moustache.</li>
<li> A dab of water and a finger smoothing softens it all up pretty good as well.</li>
<li> Pretty good.  </li>
<li> I ended up liking it so much, I bought my own!</li>
<li> The wax is good but the brush disintegrated on first use.</li>
<li> Pleasant smell and taste, holds up very well.</li>
<li> It is easy to apply and holds OK.</li>
<li> Ok, so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;ve tried that many different brands, just a handful - for more reviews of more moustache waxes you could see the UK Handle Bar Club&#x27;s site, which is a GREAT site and covers all sort of stuff for taking care of your &#x27;stache.</li>
<li> He had never thought to get wax and thought it was the most thoughtful gift.</li>
<li> Smells great and dries clear.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands and this is still the best!</li>
<li> Though the comb is chincy, the wax is easy to work with.</li>
<li> It goes on easy -</li>
<li> It washes off your fingers easily, so you don&#x27;t end up with wax on your fingertips until it wears off.&lt;br</li>
<li> Mustache comb included makes application easy.  </li>
<li> This wax isn&#x27;t as easy to apply as a couple of others I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
<li> This mustache wax is widely considered to be the best available.</li>
<li> Works well, easy to apply.</li>
<li> EASY TO USE....</li>
<li> Otherwise she says it is too strong.</li>
<li> The odor was too strong for me.</li>
<li> Wasn&#x27;t as strong as I hoped.</li>
<li> Not fond of the taste and strong smell compared to wax products.</li>
<li> Does exactly what it should, I am much more comfortable and able to eat more easily without my whiskers in my mouth.</li>
<li> The comb is pretty nice, though it reminds me of a dental pick.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s working out just fine.  </li>
<li> My husband sports a handlebar moustache and uses this product to keep it in fine shape.  </li>
<li> quick service  ok</li>
<li> This was a great beginning moustache wax but as his moustache grew, it wasn&#x27;t strong enough to keep the hold.  </li>
<li> Awesome pproduct just can feel a little oily on the skin</li>
<li> So far the best wax I have tried so far.  </li>
<li> so this is an important consideration.</li>
<li> However, the light application does not keep them in place all</li>
<li> If I can&#x27;t find that happy medium, I&#x27;ll be shopping for hairspray next.</li>
<li> So until I find something else this is my go to with a light touch.</li>
<li> This stuff is not waxy at all, instead drying smooth to the touch.</li>
<li> I ended up finding something truly fragrance free on Etsy.</li>
<li> The wax is fantastic</li>
<li> I prefer the fireman brand, which is a lot stiffer and feels like straight up beeswax, but holds the way I need it too and the excess comes out nicely.</li>
<li> I also really enjoy the comb that it came with.</li>
<li> Hubby has been using it for several months now, has a nice handlebar mustache that I love, and young strangers often stop him to tell them what a great mustache he has.  </li>
<li> We&#x27;re horse people, and the mustache looks great with his western hat and clothes.  </li>
<li> Clubmans is fast, easy and stays strong all day, yet washes out of my comb and stash quickly under warm water (unlike some products that seem like oil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Does the job better than most for a reasonable price.</li>
<li> Wax in a tin is far superior to wax in a tube because you can carry it around for touchups.  </li>
<li> Being right under my nose, It smells ok too.</li>
<li> Takes a minute to get used to working with it but very worth it.</li>
<li> , I followed my first order of one unit and got four more orders.</li>
<li> that it has gotten significantly longer</li>
<li> It&#x27;s OK for my first mustache wax.  </li>
<li> The results were good - better than with Brown - but not quite my natural because it still covered up too much (which is the point,</li>
<li> i originally got this for my boyfriend, who decdided to grow a mustache to see what he looked like with one.</li>
<li> this was my first mustache wax purchase and i am satisfied.</li>
<li> Easy to use, distinct smell</li>
<li> The people selling it were great as far as getting it to me fast.  </li>
<li> This stuff keeps my cookie duster tamed and smells pretty nice when I first put it on, too.</li>
<li> It also washes out super easy, so again, good if you are just starting.</li>
<li> Has good staying power but have to use more than expected.</li>
<li> The product also has a very soft soap like smell which is quite nice .</li>
<li> Therefore: I have discovered that &#x27;neutral&#x27; or white works PERFECTLY WELL for my needs, and in reality it simply dries clear or invisible in your &#x27;stache.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy, and use it in good health!&lt;br /&gt;-Jonathanr</li>
<li> Clubman is the best wax out there, it&#x27;s just getting hard to find.</li>
<li> Use it daily good product</li>
<li> If you are just starting to wax your moustache, this stuff is good to start with.  </li>
<li> and it is nice and soft.</li>
<li> It lets your mustache still stay full</li>
<li> This leaves the \\&quot;handle bars\\&quot; full and curling like I prefer and it maintains the shape all day.</li>
<li> /&gt;Again, it is good for a smaller stache</li>
<li> but  not too good for a larger stache...</li>
<li> Somtimes I want my tips up, sometimes, I like them more straight out.</li>
<li> To grow a good &#x27;stache, must do proper grooming.</li>
<li> It stays white all day, which does not look good on a brown mustache.  </li>
<li> The delivery was fast and know others that use this product and they keep ordering more.</li>
<li> It was a fruity sweet smell but it wasn&#x27;t working for me.  </li>
<li> There are better waxes out there if you want a real stong hold.</li>
<li> Works ok, maybe I was hoping too much.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
<li> /&gt;Decent scent which is important since it is right under my nose, that seems to disappear</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t have the hold a true wax, mild hold.  </li>
<li> Good hold (much, much better than local pharmacy products) and decent price.</li>
<li> It washes out of your &#x27;stache easily when you shower without leaving a residue, making it easy to get a new style in in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;6.</li>
<li> When I first started growing my handlebar the clubman worked fine.</li>
<li> I quickly noticed a couple of problems with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Seemed to perform adequately, thus...</li>
<li> but it goes away quickly.</li>
<li> I am a first time user of wax and am glad to say this product works exactly as I wanted it to.</li>
<li> and this is a super product for me.  </li>
<li> Shipped quickly.</li>
<li> but I enjoyed the scent and the hold was decent.</li>
<li> well (ok, so I&#x27;ve gotten a few containers that were more dried out, but if the seal is good, it&#x27;s nice and smooth and creamy).</li>
<li> I had to mix them together to get the color right, which made the whole process a lot more work than it should have been.</li>
<li> shipper was Wasatch Beauty and shipped very fast !</li>
<li> The neutral wax is great for lighter colored hairs and blends down to almost invisible.</li>
<li> Thanks for such an amazing product!</li>
<li> First off, its not so much a wax but more so a paste.</li>
<li> , I didn&#x27;t have to use too much to get the desired result, and the brush/comb it comes with made the process easy.  </li>
<li> Easy to apply and doesnt leave much residue if you comb thoroughly.  </li>
<li> It actually smells pretty good, and it is inexpensive</li>
<li> product did a pretty good job, although I had hoped for a little more &amp;#34;muscle&amp;#34; and staying power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Tried this product and it really WORKS!!</li>
<li> The comb is a cheap piece of plastic and I was very unsatisfied.</li>
<li> comb and brush combo does an effective enough job helping apply the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> This can&#x27;t even be considered wax, it&#x27;s a white paste that comes out of a metallic tube, kind of like toothpaste.</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many clear and tinted brow gels/waxes in my time</li>
<li> and it will be worth it</li>
<li> My findings were that the clear (or neutral) version works as described for the most part.</li>
<li> Still, worth the money.  </li>
<li> Of course, anybody with a long enough moustache to require wax, you&#x27;re already pretty awesome.</li>
<li> It was fun while it lasted though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> but now I am mostly gray and use clear.</li>
<li> However, for the price this is a solid wax that holds for hours, the brush/comb isn&#x27;t all that useful besides being an applicator, but its a nice bonus I guess.</li>
<li> This is far better than using hair gel I&#x27;ve found and it lasts all day.</li>
<li> But the cap broke, so I couldn&#x27;t keep the wax fresh inside the tube.  </li>
<li> Honestly, these are good, but not great.</li>
<li> The hold works fine for me, but then I don&#x27;t have handlebars or anything high maintenance like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Having used other Clubman products with good results, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  </li>
<li> That is what wax is for right?  </li>
<li> Washes right out with water.</li>
<li> right outta the tube.</li>
<li> Very classy looking tube , kind of old school .</li>
<li> Good wax for someone starting out with a mustache as it&#x27;s not a straight wax and is more forgiving.</li>
<li> This is a great product to start out with if your mustache is small.</li>
<li> I think this is a great product for taming the beast that has been calling my upper-lip home for the past 9 months.</li>
<li> I think a creamy wax (type type) is better for general conditioning and parting.</li>
<li> If you don&#x27;t mind spending a few more dollars, I suggest looking around for some quality waxes like Firehouse or Oregon Wild Hair, but if you need a good cheapie, this will do.</li>
<li> This does help, but the hold isn&#x27;t real strong so he still has to trim the center area and just grow out the sides.</li>
<li> Several of us use the same tube and fine that the hold is exceptional.  </li>
<li> This gives me the ability to modify it if it didn&#x27;t come out quite right when I first put it on.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
<li> When used right, wax does a more then adequate job of holding the shape of a moustache all day long (including a handlebar Stache)</li>
<li> my needs, and in reality it simply dries clear or invisible in your &#x27;stache.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy, and use it in good health!&lt;br /&gt;-Jonathan</li>
<li> I prefer Oregon Wild Hair Moustache Wax, or just a really strong hair gel like Got2b.</li>
<li> /&gt;So when a locals store started carrying Neutral, I warmed and thoroughly mixed 2/3 Neutral with 1/3 Chestnut in a small container and came up with the perfect tone for me...just the slightest hint of color but not remotely artificial or covered-up looking.</li>
<li> (has a kind of citrus smell), has good holding power, but can leave flakes (small white particles) in your moustache</li>
<li> I had never waxed my mustache before, and was a little hesitant to become one of the initiated, but this product had good reviews</li>
<li> Good little grooming item</li>
<li> The scent smells like a lemon creme pie at first then disappears.</li>
<li> it does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
<li> I first used Clubman&#x27;s mustache wax because it was recommended by someone at a bar I went to.</li>
<li> This is my first mustache wax and I&#x27;m very thankful I found it!</li>
<li> My wife loves the stache ;)</li>
<li> exactly where you want it.&lt;br</li>
<li> The wax is great and long lasting.</li>
<li> Thanks!</li>
<li> This is my first time trying this product for my moustache</li>
<li> This was the first moustache wax I purchased after growing my moustache out.</li>
<li> It was enough to make me appreciate a comb&#x27;s function in grooming the moustache and desire to purchase a better one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> , however neither was it such an outstanding product as to make me a repeat customer.</li>
<li> Product description claims there is no &#x27;unsettling fragrance&#x27;.</li>
<li> Was my first moustache wax.</li>
<li> Holds all day, even in hot 90 degree heat.</li>
<li> It holds pretty well though, so I&#x27;m going to finish the tube.</li>
<li> This is my first wax I have ever tried.</li>
<li> I only wish they would come up with a better comb....</li>
<li> This was my first foray into the realm of moustache wax, so take this review with a grain of salt.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried many different waxes over the 40</li>
<li> This was the first wax I have tried.  </li>
<li> I am afraid that I really cannot speak to how good this product is because I lost a good bit of mustache fighting a grass fire</li>
<li> It makes your &#x27;stache pliable but it stays put exactly where you want it to.</li>
<li> I have used these products for many years and the quality remains constant.  </li>
<li> Exactly as described.</li>
<li> This stuff lasts and holds my wiry stache exactly where and how I want it.</li>
<li> Will be ordering more in the future.</li>
<li> not as crisp an appearance as I want.</li>
<li> Does the job, thicker/stays in place better than last one I tried</li>
<li> exactly what you expect</li>
<li> I think it does what it&#x27;s supposed to pretty well.</li>
<li> I got it because I read some good reviews, but its a waste.</li>
<li> plan to keep trying until I get the appropriate balance between a natural look and complete control.  </li>
<li> It was very affordable and I recieved it very fast after purchase.  </li>
<li> Another positive is that a brush/comb is included</li>
<li> I think something that needs to be said in these reviews of mustache wax is that you need to buy the right wax for your particular stache.</li>
<li> , the shipping was lightning fast and the product was exactly what they are showing.</li>
<li> My moustache is pretty light colored, and when I use this wax, it is lightened even further.</li>
<li> the brown mustache had a strong white layer look to it.  </li>
<li> But after a certain point of growth, it&#x27;s lost it&#x27;s molding abilities.</li>
<li> If you want your stache to stay in a certain style you&#x27;ll have to apply a lot of this wax</li>
<li> I had very high hopes for this</li>
<li> /&gt;Would be nice to have a little how to flyer with tips for newbies,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I followed all of the instructions they weren&#x27;t that hard, but still did not get any good results.</li>
<li> Last throughout the whole day and has a light fragrance.  </li>
<li> And now that I&#x27;ve trimmed off my mustache, I don&#x27;t have much use for this.</li>
<li> Adding water can extend the working time, but too much water</li>
<li> He mainly wants to keep it out of his mouth while he is growing it out.</li>
<li> when I get up in the morning I comb the mustache out and gently shape it with my fingers.  </li>
<li> the Clubman no longer holds very well</li>
<li> It&#x27;s actually very nice.&lt;br</li>
<li> NOT USE TOO MUCH OF IT.</li>
<li> Thanks</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t take much of this stuff to make your mustache do what you want it to do.</li>
<li> Very inexpensive but does the job of keeping the longer hairs in order.</li>
<li> Works OK but not very resilient.  </li>
<li> Works really well.</li>
<li> Thanks.</li>
<li> Getting a comb/brush is a real bennie, too.</li>
<li> Thanks</li>
<li> Well, it keeps my handlebar moustache out of my mouth for a whole day, and that&#x27;s about all you can say about moustache wax.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t really like it though.</li>
<li> Clubman wax works very well.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t hold very well either.</li>
<li> Very good...keeps the strays in place.&lt;br</li>
<li> This wax really didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
<li> and it really works on my mustache.</li>
<li> A harder wax (like the types found in metal tins) is better for stiffening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> you really have to rub it all in..</li>
<li> This stuff works really well.</li>
<li> worked very well, in fact it worked so well that my mustache attained a length my wife found it to be our of her comfort zone.  </li>
<li> My husband likes the moustache wax and it works very well.  </li>
<li> This did not help me much for my mustache</li>
<li> Works as advertised at a reasonable price.</li>
<li> Mission accomplished</li>
<li> Wish I hadn&#x27;t paid $5 for this product, really doesn&#x27;t hold up very well.</li>
<li> It works really well.</li>
<li> Holds very well and no order.</li>
<li> It has never lasted me through a whole day; I used to carry it around in my pocket so WHEN it stopped working I could fix my mustache.  </li>
<li> Very sticky, held stash well</li>
<li> REASONABLY PRICED ...</li>
<li> and I really really tried.</li>
<li> To maintain a good moustache curl you will need to reapply the product at least once throughout the day.</li>
<li> It comes in different colors, which may be nice if you need to hide the white hairs or make them darker.</li>
<li> Not very expensive, reasonable hold.</li>
<li> First of all the comb is super cheap and broke after a few times use.  </li>
<li> I live in a hot city</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think any other product would have a good hold without feeling similar.</li>
<li> /&gt;Bottom line it has helped keep my mustache out of my mouth when eating, I would buy it again, but I may also want to experiment with one or two other products to see if they might do the job better.</li>
<li> Yet, she does like it much better than some other waxes I have used.</li>
<li> I rely on this more than any of the other waxes and creams I have purchased.  </li>
<li> I bet that many a man will find clubman wax more than satisfying, but if you have very thick, coarse facial hair, clubman may not be up to the challenge.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m an old fart who is growing out a real mustache fro the first time after 40 years of a trimmed one.</li>
<li> I read a series of good reviews for this wax, and after trying it for a week, I have to give it a big thumbs down.</li>
<li> At 65 years old, this is my first handlebar moustache.  </li>
<li> and if your stache is dark, its a bit more noticeable.</li>
<li> Probably works as intended, but it stays pretty soft, and as a result does not provide a lot of control for shaping.  </li>
<li> Sure a little goes a long way but it would be nice to have a bigger container.</li>
<li> and as we all spend a fair amount of time talking and eating you do want your mustache to have a little flexibility --- so as I mentioned above, I do recommend this product.</li>
<li> I have used this product before and this tube is better than I got previously.</li>
<li> A decent amount of hold for your mustache.</li>
<li> This wax is a classic.</li>
<li> If you want a decent wax try something else.</li>
<li> This stuff holds tight and does a better job of holding onto those racally hairs around the lips.  </li>
<li> With the black wax, and I&#x27;m sure with the other colors as well, it stains your fingers [but can be easily washed out], towels, etc.</li>
<li> Would highly recommend to any moustached friend</li>
<li> a high note</li>
<li> Highly recommend.</li>
<li> , I would highly recommend this product for your moustache.</li>
<li> While most other mustache waxes make you look like an 1890s wannabe, clubman, used judiciously, allows you to style your stache while keeping a natural, us waxed look.</li>
<li> It is more greasy than waxy, so it did little to hold my moustache in place.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t purchase it for the comb of course, but thought it&#x27;d come with something a little more sturdy.</li>
<li> (I was growing a handlebar), it really is like not stiff.</li>
<li> The wax goes on easy, tends to dull the hair a little bit, but if you work it enough, it looks great.</li>
<li> We ordered the clear color and it works very well for my fianc&amp;eacute; to style his handlebar mustache.</li>
<li> I got this a few days ago and each day my handlebar looks better.</li>
<li> The comb does a fair job of blending it into your &#x27;stache, but it pulls your hair and is irritating quickly.&lt;br</li>
<li> Its holds pretty strong and you do not need very much at all but does leave a little bit of residue (does not dry completely clear).</li>
<li> It&#x27;s just not available locally so I am glad to have a new source.</li>
<li> Although the black wax had a nice color to it, next time I will buy the neutral.</li>
<li> /&gt;The smell is great, doesn&#x27;t last very long and reminds me slightly of lavender.&lt;br</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t break me out and is so much cheaper and accessible than other clear eyebrow waxes/</li>
<li> Live and learn.</li>
<li> bought for my husband who is new to the handle bar world.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
<li> The only reason I got it online is because where I live you really can&#x27;t find much of anything.</li>
<li> Next time I&#x27;ll buy the tinted kind because sometimes it can dry white.</li>
<li> This wax keeps my unruly brows in place all day without the stiff hold or flaking off like so many clear eyebrow gels.  </li>
<li> Also, while applying I don&#x27;t really use the comb and just apply a small amount to my fingers and even it through, which results the dye to rub/smear onto my skin, which is easily removed, but still a hassle.</li>
<li> /&gt;However, I usually do not use anything with a fragrance, but for this quality wax, I do not mind bending my rule!&lt;br /&gt;DO</li>
<li> But shipping, put a per tube price a bit higher than when I could by it locally.</li>
<li> It is most likely due to the nature of white/silver hairs.  </li>
<li> and I work outside in the hot west Texas sun.</li>
<li> Several teeth broke out of the comb in the first week.</li>
<li> The only problem I have is the smell when you first put it on.</li>
<li> I have a pretty coarse moustache, and to get this wax to even begin to hold I have to use about an 8th of the tube, and if I manage to get it</li>
<li> Ive had a handlebar moustache off and on for the past 20yrs and Clubman is my favorite wax.</li>
<li> Others are not quite so strong a hold, and adding a little water to the fingers when applying makes the hold stronger still.</li>
<li> cause it was taking too long to get it just right.</li>
<li> It goes on easily and dries with a firm hold.  </li>
<li> you decided to finally become a true man and grow out your facial</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a strong citrusy smell to me but it does wear off after a few minutes.</li>
<li> Anyhow, it has a moderate hold (not great) and smells kind of funny.  </li>
<li> The wax is more like a hard paste that can be difficult to squeeze from the tube unless you warm it between your hands first.</li>
<li> It only held for half of the day, then I had to reapply more, and then it would be a bit goopy (unless there is a trick</li>
<li> brush missing a clump of bristles, otherwise fine.</li>
<li> Used in large amounts, it is visibly white.</li>
<li> The caveat is that you need to make sure to use as little as possible.</li>
<li> The label says it is clear.</li>
<li> Having used Clubman Moustache Wax for ages I was surprised to discover,a day before a vacation trip,that CVS no longer carried it.</li>
<li> I have a modified 3 musketeer type mustache, which is extremely long, needing a lot of hold under hot conditions.  </li>
<li> if you want to look old school, this wrote the textbook.</li>
<li> My husband likes it very much, it last all day and still will wash out very well</li>
<li> We are using on my old man&#x27;s wild eyebrow.  </li>
<li> The stood up and had a wild and unkempt look</li>
<li> My &#x27;stache is unruly to the max; looks like an overgrown thicket gone wild.</li>
<li> I will stick with natural look.</li>
<li> But Clubman is so far working well for me to part a growing bushy stache until it gets long-enough to create a handlebar shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> About a year ago I asked my husband to grow his mustache out into a handlebar that curls up a the ends -- old fashioned, but then we&#x27;re senior citizens.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had a handle bar for almost 4 years as such I have purchased Clubman&#x27;s several times, only because it is readily available.  </li>
<li> it leaves a white film if you have darker hair, unless you really work it in there.</li>
<li> The only thing I could think of was to twist&lt;br /&gt;it up on the ends until it started to really grow out.</li>
<li> First, unless you have white facial hair, don&#x27;t buy \\&quot;neutral\\&quot;.</li>
<li> Compared to other products this is pretty good stuff, but it&#x27;s not perfect.</li>
<li> The little brush is cool.</li>
<li> The Clubman Moustache Wax (Neutral) is exactly what I expected from this company.</li>
<li> Feels pretty thick at first and looked like it was going to frost my hair, but once it fully dries it is clear.</li>
<li> so it washes out in a second, but doesn&#x27;t drip out when under normal use.</li>
<li> (Anastasia, Tweezerman, Maybelline, Revlon, Ardell, Dior, Shu Uemura, Smashbox, Becca, etc), some being total misses (stiffness, flakey, shiny look) and others have been good but far too expensive.  </li>
<li> When it dries, it provides a solid, if not HARD setting for your &#x27;stache.</li>
<li> I am writing this without having used mustache wax before, but it clumped up easily and was hard to use.  </li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t hold very well or for very long.  </li>
<li> It is a very inexpensive item and it keeps hold for a very long time.</li>
<li> if you put to much it leave white residue not enough hold</li>
<li> Does the job, but the neutral one is white and remains white on your mustache, you have to really brush it in or use your fingers to try and blend it in.</li>
<li> I need something at least as strong as this Clubman to hold the moustache, but I don&#x27;t like the way the hairs feel glued to my face.  </li>
<li> didn&#x27;t have any major issues that would prevent me from using this product again</li>
<li> No other product works as well for me.</li>
<li> It held well and did its job when no other wax probably would.  </li>
<li> For a long time the only Clubman wax locally available was Brown, which is too dark for my mixed color &#x27;stache (dark brown, light brown, red and gray).</li>
<li> The little comb is useful for pre-grooming.</li>
<li> The little brush is useful.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s just not stiff enough for me.</li>
<li> Got this for my boyfriend as sort of a gag gift and he loves it and ended up using it a lot to calm down those mustache hairs!</li>
<li> This is probably just a result of wax in general</li>
<li> The neutral color is initially white, but dries clear.</li>
<li> I am still learning to use it properly, but so far - no problems.  </li>
<li> only problem is if u dont comb out enough leaves white globs and by combing too much</li>
<li> , it will barely hold for an hour.</li>
<li> The scent is nice, almost fruity, but incredibly faint.</li>
<li> The back of the included brush makes a better hole in the end of the tube than the point on the cap does; other than that, I don&#x27;t use the little brush.</li>
<li> I prefer hard heat per use waxes, but if you want something fast choose pretty much any other semi-firm wax.  </li>
<li> The brown is too dark and the &amp;#34;neutral&amp;#34; will definitely turn your mustache white--I had to buy the brown and the neutral and mix them together in order to get the color right.</li>
<li> made all my curly mustache dreams come true, works extremely well, hardens fast, and help up a curled stache through 3 hours of a heavy dubstep show that i walked away from entirely drenched</li>
<li> Even in small amounts, the \\&quot;neutral\\&quot; color never seems to blend properly into my light brown facial hair.</li>
<li> Since this is the first time I tried training my moustache, I have little to go on except this Clubman wax and the beeswax that I used.  </li>
<li> , if I put too much on I can see it in my hair (which is a dark brown).</li>
<li> Really plasters down the moustache  </li>
<li> only useful thing I got out of it was the small brush.</li>
<li> I found this to be false, there was a strong fragrance to it that gave me a headache (lemon-ish smell).</li>
<li> Even being careful by holding it very near the comb itself</li>
<li> /&gt;The comb that comes with Clubman is weak and cheap.</li>
<li> Like other reviews, I would say its main benefit is lack of taste, firm but not too stiff and easily washed out (or off).</li>
<li> My only complaint is mild flaking if used generously, and any moisture destroys the hold.</li>
<li> This goes on soft and easy with very little work and then after about 15 to 30 seconds it sets and you have a very firm but still pliable hold.</li>
<li> My eyebrows are black and the &#x27;natural&#x27; color applies clear without giving a wet look - my brows just look natural.</li>
<li> I will say however that the Rite Aid kit came with a much nicer little comb and a pair of scissors though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It is like using mouse on unrully hair, when really you need extra stiff gel.  </li>
<li> It holds very well, but does not look unnaturally stiff.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s only been a few days and his eyebrows are starting to lay down a little more.  </li>
<li> I found that the issue with the Clubman Neutral wax is that when you apply the wax to your hair, the phrase, \\&quot;a little goes a long way\\&quot;, really applies here.</li>
<li> If you&#x27;ve got an extreme handlebar or a Dali &#x27;stache, and not looking for what you might describe as a natural look, this probably fills the bill.</li>
<li> this worked pretty well for him.the only complaint he had was a bit of white residue.</li>
<li> It does not go on uniformly, you always have little chunks of wax in your stache that do not dry clear, which makes it look like you have mustache dandruff.  </li>
<li> If you are applying only once a day it leaves a hard plug in the tube much like when lotion hardens in the pump and then shoots that gross plug into your palm that you just cant quite rub in (nor would you want to)</li>
<li> There are always small bits that are visible no matter how much I blend or comb with the included tool.&lt;br</li>
<li> Doesn hold as long as it should, have to apply several times a day.</li>
<li> this wax holds all day long and  can be reshaped several times without the need to reapply</li>
<li> It was not that good... DISAPPOINTED ;(</li>
<li> When it is dry, you can still mold it or move it to a different shape if you want.</li>
<li> Only complaint was that if I used to much it would dry out and leave a white residue in my &#x27;stache.</li>
<li> so be careful not to accidentally apply wax and have a gross white chunk hanging from your lip.</li>
<li> This will last him for a very long time!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m new to serious facial hair, and my &#x27;stache recently got long enough that wax was a necessity.  </li>
<li> Much needed and hard to find.</li>
<li> Does not hold as long as I would like.  </li>
<li> If you have a long &#x27;stache, you WILL taste what is in it from time to time (or all the time)</li>
<li> This is a serviceable &amp;#34;entry-level&amp;#34; wax if you only need it to hold for a couple hours (like going out to eat), but not really an all-day solution.</li>
<li> wax held all day as long as I didn&#x27;t twirl my &#x27;stache</li>
<li> It has a strange odor that after applying it to my moustache made me quite nauseous... didn&#x27;t quite make it for me.</li>
<li> For a long time.</li>
<li> Keeps my handlebars up all day long no matter the conditions I&#x27;m working or playing in.</li>
<li> Not really for someone with darker hair as this product is a creamy white.</li>
<li> but I found it hard to apply and the little comb/brush, while making it easier to apply the wax (using the brush), the comb, despite its appearance, does not have fine enough a spread and the result is a little like a girl putting on clumpy mascara...</li>
<li> C&#x27;mon, it&#x27;s mustache wax tor crying out loud.</li>
<li> not clear like advertised.</li>
<li> my one complaint is that the neutral shows up as white on my red stache and makes me look like i&#x27;m greying or have dried boogers unless I am very judicious in my use of the product.</li>
<li> The wax itself was pretty weak.</li>
<li> I will try some other products in the future given my experience with this.</li>
<li> If you only need a little hold this might work, but if you have a stiffer facial hair this is not the one fir you</li>
<li> When I bought it they didn&#x27;t have options for other colors I was sent the neutral white color.  </li>
<li> This product has been around for a very long time.</li>
<li> All I could find locally was the consistency of tooth paste and never got firm enough.</li>
<li> in small amounts, it is more-or-less clear, but doesn&#x27;t hold.</li>
<li> The neutral color worked well with my facial hair, which is mostly dark (with a bit of gray).  </li>
<li> I have a VERY curly and wiry facial hair and all the other waxes I&#x27;ve tried can&#x27;t tame it, plus they leave a disgustingly slick oily feeling to my skin around my &#x27;stache.  </li>
<li> It does have a pretty firm hold that lasts at least 8 hours as long as you don&#x27;t get it wet.</li>
<li> My mustache is coarse and black.</li>
<li> The only grip I have is once wet the wax breaks down</li>
<li> It never lasted a whole day without breaking down, and tended to clump up like little lint balls as it dried out.</li>
<li> Just a white flaky mess I had to wash off.</li>
<li> so I&#x27;m still working on figuring out how much to use to keep the whiskers out of my mouth without making the mustache too stiff or slick, but it gets the job done.</li>
<li> [I have black facial hair with little pieces of red in it].</li>
<li> sometimes I find that there are white little wax crumbs still in my mustache hairs.</li>
<li> but I wish the comb was a little larger</li>
<li> ok, this stuff aint too bad.  </li>
<li> I expected something that would hold like Peter Seller&#x27;s &#x27;stache in the Pink Panther movies.</li>
<li> Suddenly not available through local stores ...</li>
<li> It came in as expected.</li>
<li> I had so much trouble with this product that I actually shaved my mustache!</li>
<li> anyone needing a partially used tube, give me a call</li>
<li> I purchased this for my husband who just retired from the military after 30+ years of service and he couldn&#x27;t wait to grow out his moustache and beard.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s plain and simple mustache wax.</li>
<li> As the stache was smaller it was easier to tame and keep its hold.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
<li> couldn&#x27;t find a stucky enough product to tame his hairs in the store so we bought this.</li>
<li> A few strokes keeps it in place for the day, but get your own small stiff brush- the one provided is useless.</li>
<li> The wax was not strong enough to hold my curls, and it dried into a milky like grey.</li>
<li> The wax had no taste, as it shouldn&#x27;t (if no one&#x27;s told you this yet: you WILL be eating a little bit of wax with a long moustache.</li>
<li> Little bit goes a long ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks clubmen, you helped make my beard take again and</li>
<li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
<li> , a little goes a long way and it holds for a long&lt;</li>
<li> Seriously go get a wax based one like dandy candy, or wild bills, or any one of the other bee&#x27;s wax type ones.</li>
<li> Use very little for big effect.</li>
<li> but you only need a very little bit.</li>
<li> I have used  some other waxes--</li>
<li> Other than that it works well.</li>
<li> OTHER THAN ON LINE</li>
<li> That being said, I purchased this based on the other reviews.</li>
<li> then you did, due to all the particles.</li>
<li> I would recommend any other wax.  </li>
<li> other reviews of this product</li>
<li> I got this actually for eyebrows that were a bit crazy and it really works.  </li>
<li> but it let me down hold is not great getting the right amount is hard</li>
<li> Chose this product due to previous user reviews and cost.  </li>
<li> It has become hard to find in the local stores, so I ordered three this time.  </li>
<li> We just wish the color was dark in color.  </li>
<li> The only negative to the product is the dinky comb/brush that comes with the tube...</li>
<li> I have a lighter brown/ dirty blonde facial hair and the neutral wax leaves my hair looking white and crusty</li>
<li> if you have a really thick moustache i would go with a bigger set.</li>
<li> Or perhaps my mustache is just too wiry because I have thick coarse hair.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t spread evenly and it leaves a thick white film on your mustache.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s waxy for sure, but the hold is essentially worthless.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m growing my &#x27;stache out for the first time and got REALLY sick of it constantly being in my mouth.</li>
<li> If you put his in a mustache it will leave behind chunks of dry greasing caked white flakes.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t knock it down a star because of the tube size.</li>
<li> Stopped using it and trimmed down</li>
<li> The wax itself doesn&#x27;t hold, and within a couple of minutes I found my moustache falling down.</li>
<li> so I never feel too ripped off when I break down and buy it.</li>
<li> So right out of the gate this stuff stinks.</li>
<li> I have tried a few other comb in style waxes but they never seem to hold to my liking.</li>
<li> It did tend to leave my black moustache with a white/gray tint.  </li>
<li> For some reason I didn&#x27;t choose to get the neutral color and opted for black instead</li>
<li> Works well, however it does have a slight chemical smell that some women have found objectionable.</li>
<li> However, after about an hour and a half, the handlebars started to sag.  </li>
<li> leaves greyish residue on my black mustache/beard.</li>
<li> switched to black.</li>
<li> My mustache curls out about an inch and a half now, and I&#x27;ve had to start using a hair glue to keep it curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> &quot; it leaves my black beard looking</li>
<li> I&#x27;m going to try their black mustache wax</li>
<li> , I should&#x27;ve bought the black colored one.</li>
<li> and it seems to fall apart every half hour or so.  </li>
<li> It works fine but stinks!</li>
<li> This was not a good product for me personally.</li>
<li> I apply the wax at night after I shower and twist the mustache up tight.  </li>
<li> I had been searching high and low and always came out disappointed with other products.</li>
<li> It can dry hard</li>
<li> My only complaint is that the tube is too small.</li>
<li> My mustache was a little white-ish after I applied it...</li>
<li> Comes with an little applicator brush .</li>
<li> turns your mustache with no matter how little you put in.</li>
<li> it disappears with a little brushing.</li>
<li> did like the little brush</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s takes a little time to get used to using it, for a 1st time user.</li>
<li> I also like the little comb it comes with.</li>
<li> The brush comb is little too flimsy to use, use a medium toothbrush instead....</li>
<li> I wish it had a little color to hide some of the gray.</li>
<li> And I still when use the little comb/brush that came with it.</li>
<li> still, a bit of residue, but if you just use a little, and rub it all in, it works wonders.</li>
<li> I get about 3-4 hours out of it before I have to re-work it a little.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve got little experience with products like this</li>
<li> As a beginning moustache grower I read a few articles on how to maintain a moustache.</li>
<li> This mustache wax is water soluble, and gives a firm hold.  </li>
<li> Dont waste your money on this thinking</li>
<li> It leaves behind white residue on my stache</li>
<li> stars because I do have to spend a few minutes attending it while it dries.</li>
<li> Didnt like the texture or the color it left behind.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m missing).</li>
<li> Messy.  </li>
<li> will hold your stache with a heavy application.  </li>
<li> The plastic lid cap broke after a few weeks.</li>
<li> I ordered a few of these, and by few</li>
<li> One day when the weight of the world isn&#x27;t so heavy I may have to let my &#x27;stache take hold again, but until then, i cherish the memories we had.</li>
<li> If you want wax that just makes your mustache heavy, buy this...</li>
<li> And if you apply too much to keep it up that just gunks up your stache with white wax crap.</li>
<li> Lastly, it&#x27;s so stiff.</li>
<li> Creamy but stiff when it sets.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think Clubman holds as stiff as some people say.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s ultra stiff for those handlebars.</li>
<li> This is not a strong wax, and it is winter so no humidity or heat effecting it yet.</li>
<li> IT is not easy maintaining a handle bar moustache with an inferior product.</li>
<li> I do have very black hair</li>
<li> The brush and comb combo is a little small, so</li>
<li> the smell of this moustache wax is pretty bad to my nose and smells like I&#x27;m putting chewed mint bubblegum in my moustache even though its supposedly neutral.</li>
<li> This product is a little hard to work with but gets the job done.</li>
<li> A little hard to squeeze out</li>
<li> It is also very hard to apply when your mustache is wet, which in the morning after a shower it usually is.  </li>
<li> Will buy again when run out as usual.</li>
<li> maybe im doing it wrong, but this is white and clumpy.</li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;the container is too small.</li>
<li> He was not satisfied with&lt;br /&gt;any substitute when they told him at our drug store that they no longer could get it.  </li>
<li> Not my husband&#x27;s favorite moustache wax but not the worst he has used either.</li>
<li> When he ran out a few years back he just cut it off (which made all of our family sad to see!)  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s not floral to me - it smells of harsh chemicals and is not pleasant to have on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little tough to get spread evenly and leaves a bit of a residue</li>
<li> It is extremely hard to pull it through the Clubman moustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> It is something that is hard to find in the stores.</li>
<li> oh and the comb sucks.</li>
<li> not effective, but why return a $5 item</li>
<li> It holds well and doesn&#x27;t feel clumpy or too thick.</li>
<li> The wax could be a bit stromger, but then again if it was too thick</li>
<li> My mustache is thick</li>
<li> It goes on rather thick, and has to be combed out a lot, but it is will hold like no bodies business.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t use the comb though because my beard it too thick.</li>
<li> So just be warned; \\&quot;neutral\\&quot; may mean that your light-colored moustache will become almost invisible.</li>
<li> I mean a lot of these.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never used this or similar products before so comparison is impossible.  </li>
<li> was very thick and hard to get out of the tube</li>
<li> and this arrived in bad shape as if it is kept above room temperature.&lt;br</li>
<li> having something unpleasant smelling directly under your nose would be unfortunate.)  </li>
<li> Was I shocked upon using it only to discover it had the consistency of melted butter.</li>
<li> keep buying regularly, hard to imagine anything else holding this well!</li>
<li> This stuff sucks!</li>
<li> It was tough to pull a comb through a beeswax moustache.  </li>
<li> Got tired of flossing my front teeth with my mustache and wanted something to help keep the hairs horizontal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Poor product.</li>
<li> Feels like crap on your upper lip.</li>
<li> The brush and comb are completely unnecessary though.</li>
<li> Very sticky and terrible smell!!!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s the secret behind it!</li>
<li> It is by far the worst product I have ever used.  </li>
<li> Fist, I&#x27;d like to tell you that there is a small to this wax, but it is not that bad at all.</li>
<li> Sorry, not trying to dis a company, but anyone who knows anything about a stylin stache would never use this product.</li>
<li> The hold is just weird and unnatural.</li>
<li> /&gt;It washed off with soap and water and didn&#x27;t leave my fingers all sad and</li>
<li> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with it.</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
<li> This is crap and a waste of money!</li>
<li> The product description needs to be updated to reflect that it might not have an unsettling fragrance for some but for those that cannot have any artificial fragrance it will bother them.</li>
<li> Its creamy and weird and smells bad.</li>
<li> The bad: The hold of this wax is mediocre, and even though it says it&#x27;s \\&quot;neutral\\</li>
<li> I felt that it gave it an unpleasant appearance if used too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> - I say once it dries, because before then it does have a slightly unpleasant taste.&lt;br</li>
<li> Unpleasant fragrance.</li>
<li> But it&#x27;s sort of an unpleasant experience having that stuff on the stache.</li>
<li> This wax was very difficult to find in North Dakota.  </li>
<li> It also smelled bad.  </li>
<li> It smells like some bad dollar store ointment.</li>
<li> It was looking bad to me</li>
<li> and doesnt smell too bad.</li>
<li> this one doesn&#x27;t leave a bad taste or stain your skin.</li>
<li> my stringy hairs kept pointing up :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> For about an hour there is a smell that isn&#x27;t bad but gets annoying.  </li>
<li> It made my moustache look like crap.</li>
<li> and it was awful.</li>
<li> No holding power and the smell is disgusting!</li>
<li> Terrible smell and no holding power at all.</li>
<li> Terrible hold.</li>
<li> I bought a tube of Rite Aid mustache wax and it was clumpy and horrible.</li>
<li> Bad odor!!!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Use it daily good product</li>
    <li> Easy to use, distinct smell but I like it.</li>
    <li> FORGET ABOUT USING ANYTHING ELSE! There are so many waxes out there and I don&#x27;t know whose beards/ moustaches they are made for but this is the first one that worked immediately with a small amount and kept working all day. The scent smells like a lemon creme pie at first then disappears.</li>
    <li> Excellent product would recommend to anyone trying to take command of the style of their moustache!</li>
    <li> I use the neutral white and have used Clubman off and on for 30 years.  It has become hard to find in the local stores, so I ordered three this time.  Like other reviews, I would say its main benefit is lack of taste, firm but not too stiff and easily washed out (or off). The back of the included brush makes a better hole in the end of the tube than the point on the cap does; other than that, I don&#x27;t use the little brush.</li>
    <li> It was more like a lotion.. My mustache was a little white-ish after I applied it...</li>
    <li> My store stopped carrying Clubman (same as Pinaud) moustache wax. All I could find locally was the consistency of tooth paste and never got firm enough. The Clubman holds well but falls apart in the rain. Still the best brand(s) I know.</li>
    <li> Great product even for a first time user.  I recommend it to anyone who wants to have a great looking mustache.</li>
    <li> I recommend the Clubman Moustache Wax. It holds well and doesn&#x27;t feel clumpy or too thick. To maintain a good moustache curl you will need to reapply the product at least once throughout the day. The wax could be a bit stromger, but then again if it was too thick then it would feel like you put gell or hair spray in it and as we all spend a fair amount of time talking and eating you do want your mustache to have a little flexibility --- so as I mentioned above, I do recommend this product.</li>
    <li> If you are just starting to wax your moustache, this stuff is good to start with.  It did tend to leave my black moustache with a white/gray tint.  It also washes out super easy, so again, good if you are just starting.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> It never held anything in place.  That is what wax is for right?  It also smelled bad.  The people selling it were great as far as getting it to me fast.  It just didn&#x27;t work.  Even after working it in for a while it still was visible.</li>
    <li> I received my purchase with in three days and it&#x27;s just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive. My mustache is thick so I&#x27;m still working on figuring out how much to use to keep the whiskers out of my mouth without making the mustache too stiff or slick, but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> It was not that good... DISAPPOINTED ;(</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. It goes on rather thick, and has to be combed out a lot, but it is will hold like no bodies business. It comes with a comb, and it seems like it will last forever. I have had no problems with the stuff.</li>
    <li> Does the job better than most for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Great price!</li>
    <li> Works great and smells like honey : )</li>
    <li> hop on these handlebars and take a ride!!</li>
    <li> Starts out well, if pre-warmed.  Does not hold as long as I would like.  Beats hair treatments I have tried.</li>
    <li> It works as advertised!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Prime quality and at a great price. For some reason I didn&#x27;t choose to get the neutral color and opted for black instead [I have black facial hair with little pieces of red in it]. Although the black wax had a nice color to it, next time I will buy the neutral. With the black wax, and I&#x27;m sure with the other colors as well, it stains your fingers [but can be easily washed out], towels, etc. Although that may not seem a problem, if you happen to twist your facial hair, expect a bit a color to transfer to your finger tips. Also, while applying I don&#x27;t really use the comb and just apply a small amount to my fingers and even it through, which results the dye to rub/smear onto my skin, which is easily removed, but still a hassle.</li>
    <li> Having used Clubman Moustache Wax for ages I was surprised to discover,a day before a vacation trip,that CVS no longer carried it. They now sell their own brand in a carbon copy package. I bought their product and left on my trip. Was I shocked upon using it only to discover it had the consistency of melted butter. Returning home I went to Amazon and found the original Clubman(at a better price) and am now a happy man.IT is not easy maintaining a handle bar moustache with an inferior product.Thank you Amazon</li>
    <li> Since this is the first time I tried training my moustache, I have little to go on except this Clubman wax and the beeswax that I used.  This stuff holds tight and does a better job of holding onto those racally hairs around the lips.  It was tough to pull a comb through a beeswax moustache.  It is extremely hard to pull it through the Clubman moustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it four stars.  I need something at least as strong as this Clubman to hold the moustache, but I don&#x27;t like the way the hairs feel glued to my face.  I don&#x27;t think any other product would have a good hold without feeling similar.</li>
    <li> As a beginning moustache grower I read a few articles on how to maintain a moustache. I purchased this set and within the week the comb snapped in two and the teeth of the comb had already began to break off. The comb is a cheap piece of plastic and I was very unsatisfied. The wax itself was pretty weak. It is more greasy than waxy, so it did little to hold my moustache in place. An hour after I put it in my moustache would fray out and lose its shape. Ultimately I would suggest not purchasing this combo.</li>
    <li> This wax was very difficult to find in North Dakota.  Ever since I was a child my father would wax his handle bar moustache with this wax.  When he ran out a few years back he just cut it off (which made all of our family sad to see!)  I found it on Amazon one day and purchased 5 tubes! This will last him for a very long time! He loves loves loves this product!  It was very affordable and I recieved it very fast after purchase.  Happy all around with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an old fart who is growing out a real mustache fro the first time after 40 years of a trimmed one. Got tired of flossing my front teeth with my mustache and wanted something to help keep the hairs horizontal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product did a pretty good job, although I had hoped for a little more &amp;#34;muscle&amp;#34; and staying power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decent scent which is important since it is right under my nose, that seems to disappear or I just get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb and brush combo does an effective enough job helping apply the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would be nice to have a little how to flyer with tips for newbies,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line it has helped keep my mustache out of my mouth when eating, I would buy it again, but I may also want to experiment with one or two other products to see if they might do the job better.</li>
    <li> Great product !&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted something that I could use to twist the ends up into a handlebar style stache and this is all I need . After looking at lots of products and reading LOTS of reviews , this seemed like the product for me . Very classy looking tube , kind of old school . Comes with an little applicator brush . The product also has a very soft soap like smell which is quite nice . Dries nice and holds the stache all day . Washes out with no problems . I will buy more as soon as I run out .</li>
    <li> Not very expensive, reasonable hold.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a product that could control my mustache without a glob of wax. This stuff works great. It can dry hard but if you brush it out you will have your mustache and goatee in place and it is nice and soft. My only complaint is that the tube is too small. Sure a little goes a long way but it would be nice to have a bigger container. I can&#x27;t knock it down a star because of the tube size. It is a great product and I don&#x27;t think I will ever change to another.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. The neutral wax is great for lighter colored hairs and blends down to almost invisible. The Hold is great, and washes out really easily. The scent is nice, almost fruity, but incredibly faint.</li>
    <li> it does exactly what I need it to do. Being right under my nose, It smells ok too. I&#x27;ll order it again</li>
    <li> Doesn hold as long as it should, have to apply several times a day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s plain and simple mustache wax. I used my friend&#x27;s hair wax before this got sent to me to properly form my handlebar mustache, and that worked just as well. And now that I&#x27;ve trimmed off my mustache, I don&#x27;t have much use for this. I&#x27;d recommend getting some hair wax, which seems to work just as well, and then you can still use it on your hair...</li>
    <li> Clubman is the best wax out there, it&#x27;s just getting hard to find. I don&#x27;t think they are making it anymore.</li>
    <li> This is the best moustache wax that I have ever used.  I have a modified 3 musketeer type mustache, which is extremely long, needing a lot of hold under hot conditions.  This is the wax that I recommend, and will someday bring to international competition.</li>
    <li> I have used  some other waxes-- at double the cost. This will work, if you  use the product as directed.  To get the best results- Let the product warm between your fingers then apply. Use sparingly to avoid a buildup- which can cause the problem of &#x27;dandruff flaking&#x27;, some have mentioned here. When used right, wax does a more then adequate job of holding the shape of a moustache all day long (including a handlebar Stache)</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS, unless of course you want your stache to look like a frosted Christmas tree.&lt;br /&gt;-it holds ok but it&#x27;s sticky so the hair sticks to your fingers when you try to make a nice curl&lt;br /&gt;-it leaves tons of white residue&lt;br /&gt;-a week after I bought it the tube cracked and started squirting this junk out the side&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take home: GO BUY FIREHOUSE MUSTACHE WAX (wacky tacky) from their website. it is amazing!</li>
    <li> if you want to look old school, this wrote the textbook.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working as advertised.  My husband just started using it to train a handlebar mustache so we will see.</li>
    <li> did nothing to help my &#x27;stache stay at any form what so ever. This can&#x27;t even be considered wax, it&#x27;s a white paste that comes out of a metallic tube, kind of like toothpaste. not recommended</li>
    <li> It holds very nicely. It is White, which I like and need. The label says it is clear. My Grandfather used it, too</li>
    <li> This is for the men&#x27;s department.  Good stuff</li>
    <li> Has good staying power but have to use more than expected.</li>
    <li> This wax keeps my unruly brows in place all day without the stiff hold or flaking off like so many clear eyebrow gels.  My eyebrows are black and the &#x27;natural&#x27; color applies clear without giving a wet look - my brows just look natural. After I&#x27;ve penciled my brows in with my trusty Shu Uemura pencil, I just apply a tiny amount of this wax with my fingers. It doesn&#x27;t break me out and is so much cheaper and accessible than other clear eyebrow waxes/gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many clear and tinted brow gels/waxes in my time (Anastasia, Tweezerman, Maybelline, Revlon, Ardell, Dior, Shu Uemura, Smashbox, Becca, etc), some being total misses (stiffness, flakey, shiny look) and others have been good but far too expensive.  The combination of my favorite eyebrow pencil and this Clubman Moustache wax is a Holy Grail beauty combo for me.</li>
    <li> Have used it many times before and it meets expectations and quality. Will buy again when run out as usual.</li>
    <li> My husband likes it very much, it last all day and still will wash out very well, I followed my first order of one unit and got four more orders.</li>
    <li> This mustache wax is water soluble, and gives a firm hold.  You need to form your mustache before it dries.  Adding water can extend the working time, but too much water and you&#x27;ll be washing and starting over.  The brush/comb is handy but has it&#x27;s limitations.  If you&#x27;ve got an extreme handlebar or a Dali &#x27;stache, and not looking for what you might describe as a natural look, this probably fills the bill.</li>
    <li> It lets your mustache still stay full</li>
    <li> I am writing this without having used mustache wax before, but it clumped up easily and was hard to use.  Ended up throwing it away.</li>
    <li> Sorry, not trying to dis a company, but anyone who knows anything about a stylin stache would never use this product. Its creamy and weird and smells bad. The hold is just weird and unnatural. Seriously go get a wax based one like dandy candy, or wild bills, or any one of the other bee&#x27;s wax type ones. Dont waste your money on this thinking you are gonna save 5 bucks and it will be worth it cuz it&#x27;s not.</li>
    <li> The Clubman Moustache Wax (Neutral) is exactly what I expected from this company. The wax has a refreshing aroma, and trains the moustache well. The brush and comb combo is a little small, so if you have a really thick moustache i would go with a bigger set. Overall I am very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Though the comb is chincy, the wax is easy to work with. It holds great, but still re-application throughout the day. My wife likes the scent that it has after about 20 minutes. Otherwise she says it is too strong. Yet, she does like it much better than some other waxes I have used.</li>
    <li> Second purchase.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Pleasant smell and taste, holds up very well. Keeps all the whiskers in line. Would highly recommend to any moustached friend</li>
    <li> My husband says that it helps keep his mustache in line.  He mainly wants to keep it out of his mouth while he is growing it out. This does help, but the hold isn&#x27;t real strong so he still has to trim the center area and just grow out the sides.</li>
    <li> maybe im doing it wrong, but this is white and clumpy. Couldn&#x27;t&#x27; seem to get it to stay put. Granted my mustache is not a righteous handlebar. I was going more for a Dali.</li>
    <li> Poor product. I used it once and it was awful. It made my moustache look like crap. I would recommend something organic. I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used tis wax for 20+ years always the nuetral because I&#x27;m not one to worry if I have gray hair or mustache.  actually not enough hair left to worry about.  I apply the wax at night after I shower and twist the mustache up tight.  when I get up in the morning I comb the mustache out and gently shape it with my fingers.  This leaves the \\&quot;handle bars\\&quot; full and curling like I prefer and it maintains the shape all day. I get a lot of compliments on my &#x27;stache and a lot of questions on how I keep it looking good.  I work in sales so I have to keep a neat well groomed look and the wax serves my purpose well.</li>
    <li> When I first started growing my handlebar the clubman worked fine. As the stache was smaller it was easier to tame and keep its hold.&lt;br /&gt;Now that it has gotten significantly longer the Clubman no longer holds very well, I need to keep applying it throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the fact that its water soluble does not work for me. I have a cup of coffee and some gets on the stache the wax just dissolves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is nice when washing it out or getting it off your fingers but in the rain, humid areas, or an accidental beer or coffee on your stache sends you to re apply again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, it is good for a smaller stache but  not too good for a larger stache... in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I had very high hopes for this but it let me down hold is not great getting the right amount is hard if you put to much it leave white residue not enough hold will not last I&#x27;m sticking with firehouse wax from here on</li>
    <li> ..when your LipBrush just won&#x27;t behave, here&#x27;s the answer.  A few strokes keeps it in place for the day, but get your own small stiff brush- the one provided is useless.</li>
    <li> Its holds pretty strong and you do not need very much at all but does leave a little bit of residue (does not dry completely clear). Other than that it works well.</li>
    <li> I first used Clubman&#x27;s mustache wax because it was recommended by someone at a bar I went to. First off, its not so much a wax but more so a paste. The comb that comes with it is a great useful tool in keeping the stache out of the mouth. I purchased the neutral wax because it was the only option at my local CVS. It has a citrus like scent that isn&#x27;t too overwhelming. I found it kind of pleasant. The hold is good but reapplication may be needed throughout the day if thats all you use. I found that the issue with the Clubman Neutral wax is that when you apply the wax to your hair, the phrase, \\&quot;a little goes a long way\\&quot;, really applies here. sometimes I find that there are white little wax crumbs still in my mustache hairs. I felt that it gave it an unpleasant appearance if used too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;over all i would rate this a 6/10</li>
    <li> Tried this product and it really WORKS!! Held my unruly moustache with ease. I am Joannes husband, and like the look of my &#x27;stache. I WILL buy more. Thanks for such an amazing product!</li>
    <li> I expected something that would hold like Peter Seller&#x27;s &#x27;stache in the Pink Panther movies. Perhaps it can hold like this, but it would require more than I used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used in small amounts, it is more-or-less clear, but doesn&#x27;t hold. Used in large amounts, it is visibly white. The comb does a fair job of blending it into your &#x27;stache, but it pulls your hair and is irritating quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I juat haven&#x27;t acquired the taste.</li>
    <li> Good wax for someone starting out with a mustache as it&#x27;s not a straight wax and is more forgiving.</li>
    <li> This is my first mustache wax and I&#x27;m very thankful I found it! I&#x27;m growing my &#x27;stache out for the first time and got REALLY sick of it constantly being in my mouth. This stuff keeps my cookie duster tamed and smells pretty nice when I first put it on, too. The applicator brush is very nice addition.&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note, if I put too much on I can see it in my hair (which is a dark brown). When that happens a light application of H2O blends it all together nicely.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Fist, I&#x27;d like to tell you that there is a small to this wax, but it is not that bad at all. It&#x27;s actually very nice.&lt;br /&gt;However, I usually do not use anything with a fragrance, but for this quality wax, I do not mind bending my rule!&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT USE TOO MUCH OF IT. Use very little for big effect. It&#x27;s the secret behind it!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. Bought it at the same place for years. They stopped selling the product ( Clubman ) and started selling their own brand. No where as good as Clubman by any means. Had to find the \\&quot; Clubman \\&quot; and did find it on Amazon. Good price. But shipping, put a per tube price a bit higher than when I could by it locally. But overall I wanted this product and now I have it. Thanks</li>
    <li> It leaves behind white residue on my stache and I have to keep re-applying it throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Great wax. Good quality and easy to use. Holds all day without it running or showing up. I live in a hot city but this doesn&#x27;t melt onto your lips. My wife loves the stache ;)</li>
    <li> I purchased the mustache wax to provide some entertainment while here in Baghdad.  Aside from the fact that it will melt out at temps about 108 degrees it is excellent!!  Several of us use the same tube and fine that the hold is exceptional.  Also, it moisturizes and conditions well.  I don&#x27;t use the comb though because my beard it too thick.</li>
    <li> Great works I&#x27;ve always like this product prices right</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much of this stuff to make your mustache do what you want it to do. Washes right out with water. Sure beats sleeping with curlers!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK for my first mustache wax.  Maybe it was my &#x27;stache hairs, but found myself using more than I thought I needed. Stopped using it and trimmed down cause it was taking too long to get it just right.</li>
    <li> Ok, so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;ve tried that many different brands, just a handful - for more reviews of more moustache waxes you could see the UK Handle Bar Club&#x27;s site, which is a GREAT site and covers all sort of stuff for taking care of your &#x27;stache. By the way, we need more guys to grow handlebar moustaches!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, here&#x27;s what I like about this product:&lt;br /&gt;1. It goes on easy - it&#x27;s creamy and sticks to your moustache well (ok, so I&#x27;ve gotten a few containers that were more dried out, but if the seal is good, it&#x27;s nice and smooth and creamy). This makes it very easy to style and form your &#x27;stache and get all the hairs to stick together nicely.&lt;br /&gt;2. When it dries, it provides a solid, if not HARD setting for your &#x27;stache. It keeps your &#x27;stache exactly where you want it.&lt;br /&gt;3. When it is dry, you can still mold it or move it to a different shape if you want. Somtimes I want my tips up, sometimes, I like them more straight out. This gives me the ability to modify it if it didn&#x27;t come out quite right when I first put it on.&lt;br /&gt;4. It washes off your fingers easily, so you don&#x27;t end up with wax on your fingertips until it wears off.&lt;br /&gt;5. It washes out of your &#x27;stache easily when you shower without leaving a residue, making it easy to get a new style in in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;6. Once it dries, it has almost no taste whatsoever. If you have a long &#x27;stache, you WILL taste what is in it from time to time (or all the time) so this is an important consideration. *Please note - I say once it dries, because before then it does have a slightly unpleasant taste.&lt;br /&gt;7. It comes in different colors, which may be nice if you need to hide the white hairs or make them darker. I have tried the brown and have found that it DOES NOT please &#x27;she-who-is-to-be-obeyed&#x27; because it can leave brown on the towels, washcloths, pillow cases, blankets, and anything else that comes into contact with the &#x27;stache. Therefore: I have discovered that &#x27;neutral&#x27; or white works PERFECTLY WELL for my needs, and in reality it simply dries clear or invisible in your &#x27;stache.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy, and use it in good health!&lt;br /&gt;-Jonathanr my needs, and in reality it simply dries clear or invisible in your &#x27;stache.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy, and use it in good health!&lt;br /&gt;-Jonathan</li>
    <li> The wax is great and long lasting. I would recommend his wax to anyone. I use clubman&#x27;s almost every day</li>
    <li> The ONLY Moustache wax I&#x27;ll ever use.</li>
    <li> Gonna need another for the house.. good stuff</li>
    <li> Much needed and hard to find. Might try the brown version next. Very inexpensive but does the job of keeping the longer hairs in order. Makes you look like a gentleman!</li>
    <li> Really great. Comb is a nice touch. If you have lighter colored hair it is perfect. I unfortunately have darker thicker hair and had to move on to a thicker wax with more hold.</li>
    <li> Works OK but not very resilient.  Won&#x27;t last all day or perhaps through a lunch as it resist liquids at all.</li>
    <li> I love it! This is one of the best products I have used. My mustache had never looked better. Great</li>
    <li> Works really well. Holds mustache in place and the comb is an added benefit. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This tube outlasted my mustache. what can i say about it? It will hold your mustache in that perfect hipster curl.</li>
    <li> turns your mustache with no matter how little you put in. but if you dont put enough in it doesnt even hold up.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my son for christmas and the day before he opened it he had shaved off mustache.&lt;br /&gt;He says he&#x27;ll grow again!</li>
    <li> Takes a minute to get used to working with it but very worth it. Not greasy and great smell. Great!</li>
    <li> I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE PRICE AND THE DELIVERY SAVED ME OVER A DOLLAR A TUBE NOWHERE CAN I FIND THIS WAX AT THIS PRICE OTHER THAN ON LINE THIS WILL LAST ME A GOOD PART OF THE YEAR THANK YOU</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working out just fine.  We are using on my old man&#x27;s wild eyebrow.  We just wish the color was dark in color.  He will only use it at night before going to bed.  It&#x27;s only been a few days and his eyebrows are starting to lay down a little more.  Our neighbor used it to relax her husbands eyebrow.  The stood up and had a wild and unkempt look and now they look.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> To grow a good &#x27;stache, must do proper grooming. Have never used a better wax than Clubman. Getting a comb/brush is a real bennie, too.</li>
    <li> Although the product has a nice smell, it just doesn&#x27;t work that well with my beard.  It is most likely due to the nature of white/silver hairs.  If you are not opposed to using a lot of product in your beard or don&#x27;t need too, this may be for you.  It just didn&#x27;t seem to work well for my needs is all.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what \\&quot;neutral\\&quot; means here, but this is definitely white in color.  It stays white all day, which does not look good on a brown mustache.  It does have a pretty firm hold that lasts at least 8 hours as long as you don&#x27;t get it wet.</li>
    <li> Works great and has a nice smell.</li>
    <li> At 65 years old, this is my first handlebar moustache.  I bought Clubman&#x27;s wax to get it under control.  I did not want to look like I had applied anything to my whiskers to get that control and Clubman&#x27;s can be applied without looking like it.  However, the light application does not keep them in place all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to keep trying until I get the appropriate balance between a natural look and complete control.  If I can&#x27;t find that happy medium, I&#x27;ll be shopping for hairspray next.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been growing out my soul patch for some time and decided I wanted to draw it into a point. I purchased an assortment of waxes which included Clubman. I quickly noticed a couple of problems with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Even in small amounts, the \\&quot;neutral\\&quot; color never seems to blend properly into my light brown facial hair. There are always small bits that are visible no matter how much I blend or comb with the included tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It smells like shoe polish. It&#x27;s not floral to me - it smells of harsh chemicals and is not pleasant to have on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a high note, the shipping was lightning fast and the product was exactly what they are showing. If this product works for you, the price is good and it&#x27;ll get to you quickly.</li>
    <li> this is the best!! wish I could find a bigger container of it though.</li>
    <li> Hubby said it worked great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used this or similar products before so comparison is impossible.  Chose this product due to previous user reviews and cost.  Seemed to perform adequately, thus...3 star.</li>
    <li> keeps my moustache in place with no clumping</li>
    <li> Compared to other products this is pretty good stuff, but it&#x27;s not perfect. The brown is too dark and the &amp;#34;neutral&amp;#34; will definitely turn your mustache white--I had to buy the brown and the neutral and mix them together in order to get the color right. The brown by itself works better than the neutral by itself, but (as I said) I had to mix them together to get the color right, which made the whole process a lot more work than it should have been.</li>
    <li> Best wax I&#x27;ve used to date. Mustache comb included makes application easy.  Nice scent and good holding ability.</li>
    <li> was a bit clumpy although the hold was ok</li>
    <li> A very good product. Works in well and because my stash I mostly white it disappears with a little brushing.</li>
    <li> I got this a few days ago and each day my handlebar looks better. It&#x27;s like my mustache is learning to form a curl on both sides. This goes on soft and easy with very little work and then after about 15 to 30 seconds it sets and you have a very firm but still pliable hold. It has a very pleasant fresh scent that reminds me of grapefruit. It washes out very easily my one complaint is that the neutral shows up as white on my red stache and makes me look like i&#x27;m greying or have dried boogers unless I am very judicious in my use of the product. So until I find something else this is my go to with a light touch.</li>
    <li> I have heard rumors that some tubes of this stuff rock, while others do not.  Regardless, I will not give it benefit of the doubt since inconsistent product is inexcusable.  It did nothing for my mustache and I recommend it to nobody.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. Holds all day and I work outside in the hot west Texas sun. It&#x27;s a little tough to get spread evenly and leaves a bit of a residue but it goes away quickly.</li>
    <li> Thanks I love it a very good seller</li>
    <li> Has really good hold, pleasant aroma at a great price!</li>
    <li> Works well, however it does have a slight chemical smell that some women have found objectionable.</li>
    <li> Great product for the man who has to take care of his Handlebar Stache. Great price and availability at your fingertips.</li>
    <li> Works good for me. I keep my stache medium and this wax does a good job keeping it looking neat. I don&#x27;t notice any smell after a minute or two. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> One of the best waxes on the market, my husband&#x27;s choice.</li>
    <li> It just didnt work for me. my stringy hairs kept pointing up :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh and this arrived in bad shape as if it is kept above room temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did like the little brush so there is a star for that.</li>
    <li> I bought this to turn my mustache into a handle-bar style for a steampunk party.  It worked well, I didn&#x27;t have to use too much to get the desired result, and the brush/comb it comes with made the process easy.  However, after about an hour and a half, the handlebars started to sag.  I didn&#x27;t bring any extra, so had to let it go.  This works well, but from my one experience, bring it with you if you plan to have the effect for a while to re-vamp the wax.</li>
    <li> Holds like gorilla glue!</li>
    <li> I have a VERY curly and wiry facial hair and all the other waxes I&#x27;ve tried can&#x27;t tame it, plus they leave a disgustingly slick oily feeling to my skin around my &#x27;stache.  This stuff is not waxy at all, instead drying smooth to the touch. Better yet if attended and brushed while its drying on the hairs it holds my moustache in place perfectly all day. It also washes out with ease.&lt;br /&gt;4 stars because I do have to spend a few minutes attending it while it dries.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with moustache wax. That being said, I purchased this based on the other reviews. My findings were that the clear (or neutral) version works as described for the most part. The caveat is that you need to make sure to use as little as possible. Otherwise it begins to look like dandruff in your moustache and no amount of combing through changes this. I will try some other products in the future given my experience with this.</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying this product for my moustache and it&#x27;s takes a little time to get used to using it, for a 1st time user. The delivery was fast and know others that use this product and they keep ordering more.</li>
    <li> This was the first moustache wax I purchased after growing my moustache out. The wax is more like a hard paste that can be difficult to squeeze from the tube unless you warm it between your hands first. The wax itself has a fairly pleasant citronella-ish odor that fades quickly. This is a mild-hold product. It never lasted a whole day without breaking down, and tended to clump up like little lint balls as it dried out. I had no problems with color blend, though it will stain your skin if you&#x27;re overzealous with it. The wax had no taste, as it shouldn&#x27;t (if no one&#x27;s told you this yet: you WILL be eating a little bit of wax with a long moustache. It&#x27;s unavoidable).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush/comb that comes with it tiny and flimsy. Several teeth broke out of the comb in the first week. It was enough to make me appreciate a comb&#x27;s function in grooming the moustache and desire to purchase a better one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have any major issues that would prevent me from using this product again, however neither was it such an outstanding product as to make me a repeat customer. This is a serviceable &amp;#34;entry-level&amp;#34; wax if you only need it to hold for a couple hours (like going out to eat), but not really an all-day solution.</li>
    <li> Broke out skin under moustache and had to quit using.</li>
    <li> First, unless you have white facial hair, don&#x27;t buy \\&quot;neutral\\&quot;. It takes a lot of working it in to make it not show. This is not a strong wax, and it is winter so no humidity or heat effecting it yet. It doesn&#x27;t control the stubborn hairs but it does help hold the style for a while. I won&#x27;t ever buy this again. Live and learn.</li>
    <li> So right out of the gate this stuff stinks. It smells like some bad dollar store ointment. When applied it makes you look like your mustache ate more for lunch then you did, due to all the particles. Lastly, it&#x27;s so stiff. I am amazed that anyone could rate this a 5.</li>
    <li> This product is a little hard to work with but gets the job done. Really plasters down the moustache  Good</li>
    <li> Did not perform as hoped or anticipated.  Would not recommend to anyone.  My husband decided to shave his mustache off as this was his last hope of taming it.</li>
    <li> I used the wax on special occasions but the comb I use every day, its wonderful for getting my facial hair looking nice</li>
    <li> Works like its supposed to. Feels pretty thick at first and looked like it was going to frost my hair, but once it fully dries it is clear. A dab of water and a finger smoothing softens it all up pretty good as well. The comb is pretty nice, though it reminds me of a dental pick.</li>
    <li> was very thick and hard to get out of the tube</li>
    <li> brush missing a clump of bristles, otherwise fine.</li>
    <li> This product has been around for a very long time. Probably because it works well.</li>
    <li> I had never waxed my mustache before, and was a little hesitant to become one of the initiated, but this product had good reviews and I figured that courage is only fear ignored, so I jumped in and bought some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is great, doesn&#x27;t last very long and reminds me slightly of lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is workable for quite a while, but still manages to hold while you&#x27;re working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax held all day as long as I didn&#x27;t twirl my &#x27;stache Snidely Whiplash style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It washed off with soap and water and didn&#x27;t leave my fingers all sad and sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is great. The little comb is useful for pre-grooming. All in all, a solid, simple buy.</li>
    <li> First time using mustache wax, this did a great job giving me the hold I wanted. Another positive is that a brush/comb is included</li>
    <li> Product description claims there is no &#x27;unsettling fragrance&#x27;. I found this to be false, there was a strong fragrance to it that gave me a headache (lemon-ish smell). I was specifically looking for something that was fragrance-free, which is why I purchased this product. It was not fragrance-free. My system does not tolerate chemical smells and it did not tolerate this product. The product description needs to be updated to reflect that it might not have an unsettling fragrance for some but for those that cannot have any artificial fragrance it will bother them. I ended up finding something truly fragrance free on Etsy.</li>
    <li> It has a strange odor that after applying it to my moustache made me quite nauseous... didn&#x27;t quite make it for me.</li>
    <li> My only problem with this product is that&lt;br /&gt;the container is too small.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product.  Holds up all day and into the evening and creates a really nice look for the moustache.</li>
    <li> So far the best wax I have tried so far.  Last throughout the whole day and has a light fragrance.  Shapes my handlebar very nicely and keeps it there.  Easy to apply and doesnt leave much residue if you comb thoroughly.  No quarrels whatsoever.  Buy the bulk pack its a great deal.</li>
    <li> This is not a wax but a pomade (cream that drys and stiffens).  It doesn&#x27;t have the hold a true wax, mild hold.  If you only need a little hold this might work, but if you have a stiffer facial hair this is not the one fir you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Clubman moustache wax for years ... excellent product. Suddenly not available through local stores ... bummer.&lt;br /&gt;Found online through Amazon at a great price, but don&#x27;t understand why I was charged shipping for each pkg when I ordered 5.&lt;br /&gt;No matter, glad I could find it again ... Thanks Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;DAYoung</li>
    <li> It works if you use enough of it, but it does not keep it&#x27;s hold through out the day. I recommend getting a petroleum based wax.</li>
    <li> Pinaud puts out a good mustache wax.  Creamy but stiff when it sets.  I rely on this more than any of the other waxes and creams I have purchased.  For extra stiffness I use waxes.</li>
    <li> Happy as hell with this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to serious facial hair, and my &#x27;stache recently got long enough that wax was a necessity.  Having used other Clubman products with good results, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  The scent is awesome (as it should be... having something unpleasant smelling directly under your nose would be unfortunate.)  It holds very well, but does not look unnaturally stiff.  The neutral color worked well with my facial hair, which is mostly dark (with a bit of gray).  The only negative to the product is the dinky comb/brush that comes with the tube... it&#x27;s still working, but it&#x27;s flimsy enough that I guarantee it will break before I&#x27;ve finished the tube.  I&#x27;ll have to find another way to work the wax in after it breaks.  Still, worth the money.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done but I need to use a lot more of this product than I do others I have tried.</li>
    <li> The odor was too strong for me. It was a fruity sweet smell but it wasn&#x27;t working for me.  I had to wash my moustache within five minutes because I couldn&#x27;t stand it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the brown mustache had a strong white layer look to it.  It was looking bad to me visually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did hold the hairs into place for the brief time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only useful thing I got out of it was the small brush. Managed to pull one hair out but still nice addition to my comb / brush collection.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent in my view, it does what it is supposed to do, and keeps doing it.</li>
    <li> I love this wax because it makes me look like a freakin&#x27; bamf! Of course, anybody with a long enough moustache to require wax, you&#x27;re already pretty awesome. Great product. I also like the little comb it comes with.</li>
    <li> leaves greyish residue on my black mustache/beard. switched to black.</li>
    <li> Well, it keeps my handlebar moustache out of my mouth for a whole day, and that&#x27;s about all you can say about moustache wax. It&#x27;s a good product, and has given me no cause to change.</li>
    <li> Was my first moustache wax. Didnt like the texture or the color it left behind. Have moved on to better waxes. Good starter.</li>
    <li> The material has a funky smell, but all of them do.  It does hold hairs where you want them and keeps them from going places you don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> A decent amount of hold for your mustache. Smells heavenly. My only complaint is mild flaking if used generously, and any moisture destroys the hold.</li>
    <li> For a long time the only Clubman wax locally available was Brown, which is too dark for my mixed color &#x27;stache (dark brown, light brown, red and gray). Then I learned Clubman made Chestnut, which I bought and enjoyed. The results were good - better than with Brown - but not quite my natural because it still covered up too much (which is the point, I know).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when a locals store started carrying Neutral, I warmed and thoroughly mixed 2/3 Neutral with 1/3 Chestnut in a small container and came up with the perfect tone for me...just the slightest hint of color but not remotely artificial or covered-up looking. The hold works fine for me, but then I don&#x27;t have handlebars or anything high maintenance like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what they could name it but if Clubman were to mix the Neutral and Chestnut formulations, it&#x27;d be a winner for lots of guys right outta the tube.</li>
    <li> Great for my beard and 4&amp;#34; goatee! Holds all day, even in hot 90 degree heat. Doesn&#x27;t clump up, doesn&#x27;t have white residue if applied after getting out of shower. Little bit goes a long ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks clubmen, you helped make my beard take again and the weight and hold helps straighten the hairs adding a bit of length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will keep buying regularly, hard to imagine anything else holding this well!</li>
    <li> This wax isn&#x27;t as easy to apply as a couple of others I&#x27;ve used.  Furthermore, it washes out with sweat.  I got sweaty, looked in the mirror, and it looked like I had drops of milk I my moustache as it started dissolving out.  It holds pretty well though, so I&#x27;m going to finish the tube.</li>
    <li> I am a first time user of wax and am glad to say this product works exactly as I wanted it to.</li>
    <li> Great product. I use to keep my eyebrows in place. I didn&#x27;t buy for husband i brought for self.</li>
    <li> My &#x27;stache is unruly to the max; looks like an overgrown thicket gone wild. Nothing goes in the same direction. This wax works wonders for me. Good hold (much, much better than local pharmacy products) and decent price.</li>
    <li> Good little grooming item but I wish the comb was a little larger</li>
    <li> Nice wax, holds well; nice smell.... The brush comb is little too flimsy to use, use a medium toothbrush instead.... Customer Service is awesome, they handled my problem quickly and made things very right again....</li>
    <li> This product holds the moustache in place as advertised.  I am still learning to use it properly, but so far - no problems.  I wish it had a little color to hide some of the gray.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s mustache wax. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with it. I can&#x27;t say that it changed my life, but it did the job.</li>
    <li> A friend suggested this; my boyfriend loves it and his moustache looks great!! It is easy to use and rinses out with warm water.  Will definitely be ordering again!!</li>
    <li> I was growing a mustache, and this was like supposedly the must have when it came to moustache wax. I didn&#x27;t really like it though. It only held for half of the day, then I had to reapply more, and then it would be a bit goopy (unless there is a trick I&#x27;m missing). The little brush is cool. But if you didn&#x27;t smoosh the wax well enough in your fingers, a chunk of wax would just get stuck in your mustache, and you had to comb it out, which just makes your mustache bushy. Heh, it was such a pain, I just shaved off my mustache after a month. It was fun while it lasted though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps if it came with instructions or tips, I would have liked it more. Or perhaps my mustache is just too wiry because I have thick coarse hair.</li>
    <li> Brother n law loves it!</li>
    <li> Clubman wax works very well. This is my first wax I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> Not a big fan of this product. It doesn&#x27;t spread evenly and it leaves a thick white film on your mustache. It doesn&#x27;t hold very well either. I prefer Oregon Wild Hair Moustache Wax, or just a really strong hair gel like Got2b.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to start out with if your mustache is small. When I first started growing mine, this stuff helped wonderfully. But after a certain point of growth, it&#x27;s lost it&#x27;s molding abilities. My mustache curls out about an inch and a half now, and I&#x27;ve had to start using a hair glue to keep it curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s not bad. Smells good. And I still when use the little comb/brush that came with it.</li>
    <li> Works great! My fianc&amp;eacute; loves it. We ordered the clear color and it works very well for my fianc&amp;eacute; to style his handlebar mustache.</li>
    <li> This is crap and a waste of money! No holding power and the smell is disgusting! Not going to recommend this &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I have a lighter brown/ dirty blonde facial hair and the neutral wax leaves my hair looking white and crusty which is not, in any way, the look I was going for. If it would blend in better, I would give it 5 stars as the hold is great...even like the smell. The lack of neutral properties of this product is why I would not reccomend it to folks with lighter hair.</li>
    <li> I have used this product. For a long time. I use to use the brown but now I am mostly gray and use clear. It works for me. It came in as expected.</li>
    <li> came as described. totally happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> Messy.  I will stick with natural look.</li>
    <li> The bad: The hold of this wax is mediocre, and even though it says it&#x27;s \\&quot;neutral\\&quot; it leaves my black beard looking grey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good: nice scent, cheap price.</li>
    <li> The wax is fantastic I only wish they would come up with a better comb....that always seems to break before you get to the end of the tube.. Even being careful by holding it very near the comb itself</li>
    <li> Just like putting a cream on your stach. Terrible smell and no holding power at all.</li>
    <li> this wax holds all day long and  can be reshaped several times without the need to reapply</li>
    <li> Helps to train direction of shorter hairs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands and this is still the best!</li>
    <li> Wax in a tin is far superior to wax in a tube because you can carry it around for touchups.  This tube cannot be pocketed.</li>
    <li> Works good, smells good, Is good.</li>
    <li> Very good...keeps the strays in place.&lt;br /&gt;However it has a very strong lemon scent.</li>
    <li> This wax really didn&#x27;t work out for me. Maybe I put too much of it on, but it dried with white flakes! not clear like advertised. And if I did put too much on, it&#x27;s only because I couldn&#x27;t get the hold I need for my curly whiskers. I prefer the fireman brand, which is a lot stiffer and feels like straight up beeswax, but holds the way I need it too and the excess comes out nicely. With this clubman&#x27;s I couldn&#x27;t even comb out all the excess wax. Just a white flaky mess I had to wash off. I don&#x27;t want to look like I have dandruff in my stache!</li>
    <li> Good hold but had a problem with the color showing in my mustache. I do have very black hair so that way be part of it. I&#x27;m going to try their black mustache wax</li>
    <li> My hubby has used this moustache wax for years.  He was not satisfied with&lt;br /&gt;any substitute when they told him at our drug store that they no longer could get it.  So he asked me to go online and here we are.  Satisfied customers.  Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> I am a fledgling in the world of fancy facial hair so I bought this product based on the reviews and on the &amp;#34;buzz&amp;#34; on mustache forums, yes there are mustache forums; who knew!?! I think this is a great product for taming the beast that has been calling my upper-lip home for the past 9 months. The only grip I have is once wet the wax breaks down and my mustache looks like the morning after a binder. I know its for ease of cleaning etc, but I wish I could get further along in my night than my 2nd drink before i look like a mountain man!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year and it really works on my mustache. I am on my 7th tube.</li>
    <li> works great if you know how to use wax. most people dont know what they are doing (thats why they complain), but this stuff is awesome. and doesnt smell too bad. i got the neutral color. it works great</li>
    <li> Terrible hold. Unpleasant fragrance. Feels like crap on your upper lip.</li>
    <li> Perfect, smooth &amp; creamy . It goes on easily and dries with a firm hold.  It&#x27;s my wax of choice. I&#x27;ve tried others, but I always come back to Clubman.</li>
    <li> This was my first foray into the realm of moustache wax, so take this review with a grain of salt.  Anyhow, it has a moderate hold (not great) and smells kind of funny.  The biggest problem for me, however, is the color.  My moustache is pretty light colored, and when I use this wax, it is lightened even further. My fiancee said it looked gray.  So just be warned; \\&quot;neutral\\&quot; may mean that your light-colored moustache will become almost invisible.</li>
    <li> This mustache wax is widely considered to be the best available. I bought a tube of Rite Aid mustache wax and it was clumpy and horrible. I will say however that the Rite Aid kit came with a much nicer little comb and a pair of scissors though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clubman is creamy and goes on without clumping. I think something that needs to be said in these reviews of mustache wax is that you need to buy the right wax for your particular stache. If you are looking for some wax to harden the ends of a handbar, that&#x27;s different than wax to stiffen up a part in a bushy stache. I think a creamy wax (type type) is better for general conditioning and parting. A harder wax (like the types found in metal tins) is better for stiffening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in the process of growing a handlebar mustache so I need something that will work for both. I don&#x27;t think Clubman holds as stiff as some people say. There are better waxes out there if you want a real stong hold. But Clubman is so far working well for me to part a growing bushy stache until it gets long-enough to create a handlebar shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb that comes with Clubman is weak and cheap. Invest in a better comb if you like to comb your stache.</li>
    <li> made all my curly mustache dreams come true, works extremely well, hardens fast, and help up a curled stache through 3 hours of a heavy dubstep show that i walked away from entirely drenched</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who is a mustache enthusiast. He had never thought to get wax and thought it was the most thoughtful gift. It is a great product and he intends to buy more when he runs out.</li>
    <li> the smell of this moustache wax is pretty bad to my nose and smells like I&#x27;m putting chewed mint bubblegum in my moustache even though its supposedly neutral. However, for the price this is a solid wax that holds for hours, the brush/comb isn&#x27;t all that useful besides being an applicator, but its a nice bonus I guess. If you don&#x27;t mind spending a few more dollars, I suggest looking around for some quality waxes like Firehouse or Oregon Wild Hair, but if you need a good cheapie, this will do.</li>
    <li> i originally got this for my boyfriend, who decdided to grow a mustache to see what he looked like with one. this worked pretty well for him.the only complaint he had was a bit of white residue. you really have to rub it all in.. and if your stache is dark, its a bit more noticeable. ANYWAY- after he shaved that thing off, i started using it in my eyebrows.. and i love it! it smells like fruity pebbles (yes, the cereal) to me, and it keeps those puppies in line! still, a bit of residue, but if you just use a little, and rub it all in, it works wonders.</li>
    <li> Good product, but the cap cracked within a week. Still works, but I have to scrape off the hardened end each time I need more wax.</li>
    <li> Great product that I have used for years. It&#x27;s just not available locally so I am glad to have a new source.</li>
    <li> Works good and shipped on time.</li>
    <li> this was my first mustache wax purchase and i am satisfied. I also really enjoy the comb that it came with.</li>
    <li> I use this wax for about 40 years. It is excellent to keep my moustache in shape.&lt;br /&gt;In the Netherlands it is no longer for sale so................</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold very well or for very long.  I had so much trouble with this product that I actually shaved my mustache!</li>
    <li> Great wax at a good price. The brush/comb tool is great, wax would not be as good without that tool.</li>
    <li> While most other mustache waxes make you look like an 1890s wannabe, clubman, used judiciously, allows you to style your stache while keeping a natural, us waxed look.</li>
    <li> Bought this because of the reviews i read, but it worked for me, just not that well&lt;br /&gt;it doesnt hold up all day i recomend Mens Face Stuff from etsy.com</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use wax often. This was ordered as part of my make-up for a play I&#x27;m currently in. I have used this product before and this tube is better than I got previously. Works great for me at a price I&#x27;m willing to pay.</li>
    <li> Great product delivered on time as promised. I would purchase again from them and would recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> This stuff works really well. Stuff mustache with this stuff!!</li>
    <li> Smells great (has a kind of citrus smell), has good holding power, but can leave flakes (small white particles) in your moustache (helps to use a hair dryer).  I recommend Firehouse Wacky Tacky instead.</li>
    <li> I have a handlebar moustache and this is a super product for me.  No other product works as well for me.</li>
    <li> This wax is a classic. Holds well, washes out nicely. Neutral blends well with all facial hair color. Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it should, I am much more comfortable and able to eat more easily without my whiskers in my mouth.</li>
    <li> This is far better than using hair gel I&#x27;ve found and it lasts all day. The brush and comb are completely unnecessary though.</li>
    <li> ok, this stuff aint too bad.  will hold your stache with a heavy application.  it does leave white residue in brown hairs.  i would recommend a different stache wax</li>
    <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. Shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> works and looks great. smooth, not lumpy and the perfect color match. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Worked for my newbie gray mustache.</li>
    <li> worked very well, in fact it worked so well that my mustache attained a length my wife found it to be our of her comfort zone.  anyone needing a partially used tube, give me a call</li>
    <li> Keeps the stache in shape all day</li>
    <li> Came on time and it was what I wanted</li>
    <li> This stuff sucks! I got it because I read some good reviews, but its a waste. When I bought it they didn&#x27;t have options for other colors I was sent the neutral white color.  First of all the comb is super cheap and broke after a few times use.  The plastic lid cap broke after a few weeks. The wax itself doesn&#x27;t hold, and within a couple of minutes I found my moustache falling down. And if you apply too much to keep it up that just gunks up your stache with white wax crap. I followed all of the instructions they weren&#x27;t that hard, but still did not get any good results. I don&#x27;t recommend this product. If you want a decent wax try something else.</li>

    <li> Basic moustache wax. Doesn&#x27;t stink, Tames unruly hairs. Have been buying this stuff for years, but my local stores stopped stocking it.</li>
    <li> This was my go to wax when I was a man, a man with a mustache. I ordered a few of these, and by few I mean a lot of these. Honestly, these are good, but not great. Only complaint was that if I used to much it would dry out and leave a white residue in my &#x27;stache. Don&#x27;t be dismayed though, the consistancy and hold of this wax is excellent. One day when the weight of the world isn&#x27;t so heavy I may have to let my &#x27;stache take hold again, but until then, i cherish the memories we had.</li>
    <li> It works great. The only problem I have is the smell when you first put it on. It&#x27;s a strong citrusy smell to me but it does wear off after a few minutes.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, it really helped me wrangle my mustache when I was about to just hack it off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different waxes over the 40+ years I&#x27;ve had my handlebar moustache and regardless of price, size or packaging, Clubman Wax always rises above the competition.  Many retail stores don&#x27;t carry this brand so I decided to only buy this online.  If you have a moustache - Clubman wax is a must.</li>
    <li> bought for my husband who is new to the handle bar world. couldn&#x27;t find a stucky enough product to tame his hairs in the store so we bought this.</li>
    <li> Works good. Keeps my handlebars up all day long no matter the conditions I&#x27;m working or playing in. Helps get all the compliments!!</li>
    <li> I have recommended it to others.  This was the first wax I have tried.  I get a lot of compliments on my moustache.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t as strong as I hoped. My mustache is coarse and black. The wax was not strong enough to hold my curls, and it dried into a milky like grey. I&#x27;m better off using the hair wax by Axe</li>
    <li> My husband likes the moustache wax and it works very well.  It is something that is hard to find in the stores.</li>
    <li> This did not help me much for my mustache (I was growing a handlebar), it really is like not stiff. It is like using mouse on unrully hair, when really you need extra stiff gel.  This is bringing a knife to a gun fight. ... oh and the comb sucks.</li>
    <li> I got this for my son and he was really happy with it. Works well, easy to apply. Works to hold in hair tinsel too!</li>
    <li> Not really for someone with darker hair as this product is a creamy white.</li>
    <li> Works nicely. The neutral color is initially white, but dries clear. The hold could be a bit better....I get about 3-4 hours out of it before I have to re-work it a little. When I am out, I&#x27;ll order it again.</li>
    <li> Awesome pproduct just can feel a little oily on the skin</li>
    <li> Next time will get the brown or back</li>
    <li> Works as advertised at a reasonable price. Just grew out my mustache and I wasn&#x27;t sure how to keep the hair under control.  Mission accomplished</li>
    <li> Pretty good.  But the cap broke, so I couldn&#x27;t keep the wax fresh inside the tube.  It is waxy, so...yeah.  Smells good.</li>
    <li> Wish I hadn&#x27;t paid $5 for this product, really doesn&#x27;t hold up very well. Having said that, good luck with you business.</li>
    <li> This is the best product without going nuts on price.  Others are not quite so strong a hold, and adding a little water to the fingers when applying makes the hold stronger still. (A tip from a friend)/  You can do some decorative Stash-forming with this stuff.</li>
    <li> Works good... only problem is if u dont comb out enough leaves white globs and by combing too much you lose the hold... is not the greatest if hair is thinner... all in all good for price.. dont know if id purchase again...</li>
    <li> Not my husband&#x27;s favorite moustache wax but not the worst he has used either.</li>
    <li> The product works great! It is a very inexpensive item and it keeps hold for a very long time. I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> If you want wax that just makes your mustache heavy, buy this...doesnt hold well at all. Wouldnt buy again. Yup</li>
    <li> Nice stuff, bought it for my boyfriend and it works well! Next time I&#x27;ll buy the tinted kind because sometimes it can dry white.</li>
    <li> My dad has used this stuff for years and I was looking to replace his. I ended up liking it so much, I bought my own!</li>
    <li> My husband loves the wax, but the comb busted in no time. I didn&#x27;t purchase it for the comb of course, but thought it&#x27;d come with something a little more sturdy. The wax goes on easy, tends to dull the hair a little bit, but if you work it enough, it looks great. Excellent handle-bar-age was achieved.</li>
    <li> Got it for my brother in law, he loves it&lt;br /&gt;Good product!</li>
    <li> I read a series of good reviews for this wax, and after trying it for a week, I have to give it a big thumbs down. I have a pretty coarse moustache, and to get this wax to even begin to hold I have to use about an 8th of the tube, and if I manage to get it the way I like it, it will barely hold for an hour. I bet that many a man will find clubman wax more than satisfying, but if you have very thick, coarse facial hair, clubman may not be up to the challenge.</li>
    <li> About a year ago I asked my husband to grow his mustache out into a handlebar that curls up a the ends -- old fashioned, but then we&#x27;re senior citizens.  We asked a barber with this type of mustache what he used, and this was what he recommended.  We looked in several drug stores, but Amazon.com was the only place I could find this.  Hubby has been using it for several months now, has a nice handlebar mustache that I love, and young strangers often stop him to tell them what a great mustache he has.  We&#x27;re horse people, and the mustache looks great with his western hat and clothes.  This works well for him and I&#x27;m in charge of reordering, which I&#x27;ve done twice now.</li>
    <li> Very sticky and terrible smell!!!</li>
    <li> I needed this to get my stash groomed for Santa Claus.&lt;br /&gt;It worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, and stays on too!</li>
    <li> best stuff for handlebars</li>
    <li> Works OK. I&#x27;m making my own wax now, but in a pinch this does the job. It is easy to apply and holds OK.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, the product is perfect for any color mustache been using this brand of mustache wax for 30 years.</li>
    <li> I order this for my dad because he hasn&#x27;t been able to find it in the stores. This is the only brand he uses.</li>
    <li> I am afraid that I really cannot speak to how good this product is because I lost a good bit of mustache fighting a grass fire but if I remember I&#x27;ll update the review when it grows back.</li>
    <li> This wax was perfect for my boyfriend who has been trying multiple mustache waxes. He likes the fact this one doesn&#x27;t leave a bad taste or stain your skin. It makes your &#x27;stache pliable but it stays put exactly where you want it to. The comb that comes with works well!</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Clubman, and I decided to grow me a handlebar mustache. I read the reviews and gave this a go. It has a very nice smell to it and goes on easy. I don&#x27;t like some of the residue though.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Too white though, but that&#x27;s my fault, I should&#x27;ve bought the black colored one. It works really well.</li>
    <li> Holds very well and no order.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a handle bar for almost 4 years as such I have purchased Clubman&#x27;s several times, only because it is readily available.  It is by far the worst product I have ever used.  It does not go on uniformly, you always have little chunks of wax in your stache that do not dry clear, which makes it look like you have mustache dandruff.  It has never lasted me through a whole day; I used to carry it around in my pocket so WHEN it stopped working I could fix my mustache.  But that was a problem because the tube ALWAYS springs a leak.  It is also very hard to apply when your mustache is wet, which in the morning after a shower it usually is.  I would recommend any other wax.  I prefer hard heat per use waxes, but if you want something fast choose pretty much any other semi-firm wax.  There are 2 things keeping me from rating this one star:  It actually smells pretty good, and it is inexpensive so I never feel too ripped off when I break down and buy it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son-in-law and he loves it.</li>
    <li> Very sticky, held stash well</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without it. Great, non-sticky formula. Smells great and dries clear. Water soluble so it washes out in a second, but doesn&#x27;t drip out when under normal use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s waxy for sure, but the hold is essentially worthless.  If if does hold, the hold will last a couple hours at best before your mustache is in your mouth.</li>
    <li> Consider &#x27;solid&#x27; wax (in tin cans) instead. This doesn&#x27;t works well</li>
    <li> Keeps my cookie duster curly. And smells as good as anything ever smelled.</li>
    <li> Good hold throughout the day. But when applying you have to be quick..careful not to delay, otherwise the wax dries up and forms flakes on the &#x27;stache. One of the awesome waxes out there.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ultra stiff for those handlebars.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the way it smells.</li>
    <li> better than the expensive stuff that I had to apply heat to just to use. If you want your stache to stay in a certain style you&#x27;ll have to apply a lot of this wax</li>
    <li> I have used these products for many years and the quality remains constant.  No complaints with the product or the providers.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I like the consistency of this wax. It does not leave a gooy feel but still helps maintain body and smells good.</li>
    <li> GOOD TUBE OF WAX...WORKS GREAT FOR FLY AWAY MOUSTACHE HAIRS...REASONABLY PRICED ...EASY TO USE....GREAT FOR EYE BROW AS WELL...GOOD PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Does the job, but the neutral one is white and remains white on your mustache, you have to really brush it in or use your fingers to try and blend it in. There are better products out there</li>
    <li> love the way it holds it together.wish they would make a more mlarger comb/brush.But it worksks.</li>
    <li> I used this until I got a better holding wax but I enjoyed the scent and the hold was decent. It is more of a paste then wax but that makes it easier to apply. The little brush is useful.</li>
    <li> not effective, but why return a $5 item</li>
    <li> A friend of mine let me use a dab of his and man was it great! I had been searching high and low and always came out disappointed with other products. This stuff lasts and holds my wiry stache exactly where and how I want it.</li>
    <li> Even though it says neutral color it leaves a white film if you have darker hair, unless you really work it in there. The only problem is once you work it in enough to make the whiteness go away, it looses its hold and pliability. If you are applying only once a day it leaves a hard plug in the tube much like when lotion hardens in the pump and then shoots that gross plug into your palm that you just cant quite rub in (nor would you want to) so be careful not to accidentally apply wax and have a gross white chunk hanging from your lip. Pleasant smell though. 3 out of 5, justice is served.</li>
    <li> I decided not to be a hipster, but I kept it in case I change my mind or join a carnival and want a curlycue mustache</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband who just retired from the military after 30+ years of service and he couldn&#x27;t wait to grow out his moustache and beard.  This was a great beginning moustache wax but as his moustache grew, it wasn&#x27;t strong enough to keep the hold.  We upgraded to another product line for the &amp;#34;moustache bar&amp;#34; look.</li>
    <li> An excellent product. It does as well as advertised . Will be ordering more in the future. It lasts all day with only one application</li>
    <li> Not fond of the taste and strong smell compared to wax products.</li>
    <li> Works well, and doesn&#x27;t make my mustache crunchy or rock solid.  Washes out without problems.</li>
    <li> The wax works well and it arrived in a timely manner. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got little experience with products like this but I found it hard to apply and the little comb/brush, while making it easier to apply the wax (using the brush), the comb, despite its appearance, does not have fine enough a spread and the result is a little like a girl putting on clumpy mascara... not as crisp an appearance as I want.</li>
    <li> Used when the &#x27;stash was longer.</li>
    <li> My husband sports a handlebar moustache and uses this product to keep it in fine shape.  He has enjoyed using this product for many years and gets many compliments on his fine moustache.</li>
    <li> Works ok, maybe I was hoping too much.  I have to retwist often and it seems to fall apart every half hour or so.  For about an hour there is a smell that isn&#x27;t bad but gets annoying.  This is probably just a result of wax in general but I find I want to rub my face more often with this on.</li>
    <li> Great wax to keep your stash lookin good!!!</li>
    <li> Probably works as intended, but it stays pretty soft, and as a result does not provide a lot of control for shaping.  It does help keep the moustache looking a bit more neat and controlled.</li>
    <li> Works great for my fu-manchu &#x27;stache. It has a great hold and is really easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is what you need to keep your handlebar stasch looking great!</li>
    <li> C&#x27;mon, it&#x27;s mustache wax tor crying out loud. The only reason I got it online is because where I live you really can&#x27;t find much of anything. If it ain&#x27;t at Wal-Mart, you&#x27;re screwed...and WallyMart doesn&#x27;t have this product.</li>
    <li> I decided to grow out my moustache and needed something&lt;br /&gt;to do with it. The only thing I could think of was to twist&lt;br /&gt;it up on the ends until it started to really grow out. I saw&lt;br /&gt;some other reviews of this product so I purchased a tube.&lt;br /&gt;It works great, a little goes a long way and it holds for a long&lt;br /&gt;time.&lt;br /&gt;If you decided to finally become a true man and grow out your facial&lt;br /&gt;hair, I would highly recommend this product for your moustache.</li>
    <li> Does the job, thicker/stays in place better than last one I tried</li>
    <li> exactly what you expect</li>
    <li> Bought several, should have bought one and tried it. It works fine but stinks! Bad odor!!!!!</li>
    <li> I got this actually for eyebrows that were a bit crazy and it really works.  Lasts all day. A little hard to squeeze out but you only need a very little bit.</li>
    <li> excellent product and cost effective. I&#x27;ve never looked better.</li>
    <li> Did its job and did it well.  Viva Clubman and the various products they procure.  It held well and did its job when no other wax probably would.  5 stars imo.</li>
    <li> Got this for my boyfriend as sort of a gag gift and he loves it and ended up using it a lot to calm down those mustache hairs!</li>
    <li> Works good but seems to have impurities in the product.  It does a good job of training my mustache to be combed.</li>
    <li> Oh, it met ALL my needs if you know what I&#x27;m saying here.</li>
    <li> Meh - unwieldy and I keep having to apply it throughout the day.  It&#x27;s just not stiff enough for me.</li>
    <li> This was not a good product for me personally. I bought the Neutral. It was not neutral. If you put his in a mustache it will leave behind chunks of dry greasing caked white flakes. It doesn&#x27;t blend in and I really really tried. No bueno.</li>
    <li> The wax is good but the brush disintegrated on first use.</li>
    <li> Ive had a handlebar moustache off and on for the past 20yrs and Clubman is my favorite wax. I have tried a few other comb in style waxes but they never seem to hold to my liking. Clubmans is fast, easy and stays strong all day, yet washes out of my comb and stash quickly under warm water (unlike some products that seem like oil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shipper was Wasatch Beauty and shipped very fast ! Thx Wasatch !</li>
    <li> quick service  ok price  works well</li>
    <li> I think it does what it&#x27;s supposed to pretty well. But it&#x27;s sort of an unpleasant experience having that stuff on the stache.</li>
</ol>
