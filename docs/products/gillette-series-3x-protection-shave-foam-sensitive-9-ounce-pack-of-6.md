      <li>My order was shipped by Amazon in excellent time.</li>
      <li>What a great deal for the price you pay for buying in bulk.  </li>
      <li>Everything said the cream itself is great, but a 6pk is a lot of shaving cream.</li>
      <li>and my husband is happy with how it shaves....</li>
      <li>for the price you cant beat it and the quantity is great</li>
      <li>(8 more words required) it is real good stuff</li>
      <li>Gillette&#x27;s is good at all that.</li>
      <li>I think it smells good</li>
      <li>I use gel all the time and my wife by accident got me this foam it not even good for the kids to put on the table to write their spelling words in it.</li>
      <li>It might seem attractive, but it really does not work well, and the lubrication it provides is fair at best.  </li>
      <li>Very Pleased, no issues</li>
      <li>This works great, but I just like the gel formula better.  </li>
      <li>Just love this wonderful shaving cream almost as much as I enjoy the convenience of amazon.  </li>
      <li>The smell is manly and not too strong, and the product is great being used with either a manual razor or an electric razor.</li>
      <li>good stuff (18 more words required)</li>
      <li>OK it is good stuff.</li>
      <li>Always a good, smooth shave.</li>
      <li>and I just realized I was able to get it in bulk packs and subscription services.</li>
      <li>and I think it works better to lubricate and hydrate the face.</li>
      <li>I love this cream.</li>
      <li>I like it, but I like the gel more.  </li>
      <li>I love gilette products.  </li>
      <li>I like the gel shave creams better than the foam ones.  </li>
      <li>Buy the better stuff if you want a better shave.  </li>
      <li>Great if you have a lot of guys around (better yet if they are particularly hairy).</li>
      <li>but they are not as good as the higher priced shaving gels.</li>
      <li>I switched to the gel style shave products many moons ago when they first became popular.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine - it works.</li>
      <li>Get it while still available.</li>
      <li>and it provides for a smooth shave.     </li>
      <li>For a good value, the old-fashioned, tried-and-true foams such as Barbasol are much better.</li>
      <li>, you get a better idea of how much you are using</li>
      <li>You&#x27;d be wise to choose a different brand.</li>
      <li>I use it on my face and my head, and it does the job, with no bad smell or irritation.</li>
      <li>If you are like me with 5 men in the house, you can probably use the six cans pretty easily.</li>
      <li>It works fine, but I have used and liked Gillette gel for several years and thought I had bought a six-pack of gel.  </li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s good foam, and I&#x27;d give it a higher rating if it wasn&#x27;t for the &#x27;watery&#x27; consistency when it comes out of the can.  </li>
      <li>I find it better to shake the can 2 or 3 times (not excessively) to make it foam up quicker.</li>
      <li>This is important to note so that you do not dispense too much after thinking there was no foam coming out.  </li>
      <li>It is simple and effective.</li>
      <li>Just so everyone knows, this is a very liquid foam (that quickly stiffens), not the gel that I anticipated.  </li>
      <li>but because of the convenience of home delivery the extra .10 per can is more than worth it for me.</li>
      <li>that too, i first thought it was just once the bottle</li>
      <li>the first couple times I use it...</li>
      <li>At $2.99 per can it is slightly higher than if I were to wait for it to go on sale at CVS or Rite Aid</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to buy my usual shaving foam (Barbasol) here on amazon.com without paying shipping and handling because for some reason only outside vendors carry it, so I decided to give something else a try, and this seemed like the best value.</li>
      <li>It prevents my skin from getting cut, and it doesn&#x27;t take much to apply.</li>
      <li>They are cheap enough that I don&#x27;t mind</li>
      <li>This foam washes away fast with just a drop of water.</li>
      <li>but when i do i know where to look thanks</li>
      <li>This can be a (minor) issue at first, as some if it might fall into the sink if you dispense it took quickly (as I have, before I got the hang of it and learned not to press the button too firmly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any of the watery issues that some other reviewers have, and I wonder if it&#x27;s perhaps because I hold the can upside down and shake vigourously before each use.</li>
      <li>I was happy to receive it although it actually was more expensive than the local WalMart</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised to discover how much closer and easier it shaved compared to the gels.</li>
      <li>I have since used this product, and it definitely is better than the foams I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
      <li>The &#x27;instructions&#x27; (nothing more than a graphic) does not say whether or not to shake the can (as with other foams).  </li>
      <li>Average cheap shaving cream.  </li>
      <li>I tried brand B foam later and it seemed to be more air less moisture.</li>
      <li>This stuff is classic, works great and is impossible to find anymore even in the million drugstores of NYC.</li>
      <li>The only thing I could mention is that it&#x27;s very watery &amp; runny</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but I&#x27;ve always used this because it seems easier on my face</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin andi am prone to razor burn.</li>
      <li>However, I suggest trying it out buy buying a single can first, to see if you&#x27;d like it.</li>
      <li>I suspect they have changed ingredients, and this reflects in the profound drop of the product quality.</li>
      <li>This stuff is just not as thick an smooth as Gillette&#x27;s series of gels.</li>
      <li>I hate going out to the store to buy things like this (mainly because I wait until I&#x27;m out), so the subscription is good.</li>

<li> so there you have it, not exactly a rave review but definitely a \\&quot;thumbs up\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Cheers</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this product and its predecessors for a very long time.</li>
<li> This is not normally on store shelves.</li>
<li> Same stuff you get in the store just for about half the price of driving in to get it.</li>
<li> Total waste.</li>
<li> Not much you can say...</li>
<li> However, as other reviewers have noted, it&#x27;s not as \\&quot;rich\\&quot; or full-bodied when it comes out of the can.  </li>
<li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
<li> Now it looks like seven-eight cans out of ten contain foam that is so runny that it&#x27;s hardly usable.</li>
<li> NOT PUT UPSIDE DOWN IN THE BATHTUB BECAUSE OF DEFECTIVE CAP.CAP</li>
<li> All I got out of the can was a liquid stream which had little semblance to shaving cream.</li>
<li> Either way (shake or no shake), when you dispense the product, it comes out rather thin, but seems to thicken up a bit, after a second or two.</li>
<li> A few years ago I noticed that some batches were too watery.</li>
<li> I bought a bulk pack and gave a few cans to people around me.</li>
<li> You really need to shake these bad boys</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not really sure why Amazon is making me review it.</li>
<li> Not very good</li>
<li> I mean - it&#x27;s shaving cream,</li>
<li> A thin coat protects my skin well.</li>
<li> The smell is plain soapy and bad.</li>
<li> But I got liquid cream which is difficult to hold and</li>
<li> Sad.</li>
<li> This is just a silly product.&lt;br /&gt;It is dispensed as a gel and then foams with body heat.  </li>
<li> When depressing the button, the foam comes out watery.  </li>
<li> Plus this way you always have some and never have that awkward moment when your&#x27;e out</li>
<li> It would be too bad if this were to be discontinued by Gillette.</li>
<li> Product was of bad quality, instead of foam</li>
<li> I may have got a bad batch</li>
<li> Too bad I bought a six pack, I&#x27;m stuck for a while.</li>
<li> GOOD.CAP DESIGN SUCKS.!!!!</li>
<li> - you would be sorely disappointed.</li>
<li> /&gt;Waster of money :-(,</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It would be too bad if this were to be discontinued by Gillette. This is a quality product. Get it while still available.</li>
    <li> Been buying on line for years. Not carried in local stores. Always a good, smooth shave. Will order over again.</li>
    <li> I made the mistake of purchasing this product, and meant to get the Gillette Series gel.  I didn&#x27;t know Gillette Series made shaving foam, too.  Nevertheless, my rating of this product is not a reflection of my not knowing this (read: I will try to be as impartial as possible here!).  I have since used this product, and it definitely is better than the foams I&#x27;ve used in the past.  However, as other reviewers have noted, it&#x27;s not as \\&quot;rich\\&quot; or full-bodied when it comes out of the can.  The &#x27;instructions&#x27; (nothing more than a graphic) does not say whether or not to shake the can (as with other foams).  Either way (shake or no shake), when you dispense the product, it comes out rather thin, but seems to thicken up a bit, after a second or two. Overall, it&#x27;s good foam, and I&#x27;d give it a higher rating if it wasn&#x27;t for the &#x27;watery&#x27; consistency when it comes out of the can.  This can be a (minor) issue at first, as some if it might fall into the sink if you dispense it took quickly (as I have, before I got the hang of it and learned not to press the button too firmly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary:&lt;br /&gt;* If you like foam, you may like this one.  3 stars for now, 4 1/2 stars if they can reformulate it to not be so runny upon dispensing.&lt;br /&gt;* If you prefer gel (as I do), you probably won&#x27;t like it.  However, I suggest trying it out buy buying a single can first, to see if you&#x27;d like it.</li>
    <li> Product was of bad quality, instead of foam the bottles just had liquid in them -unusable that too, i first thought it was just once the bottle but the other bottles had the same issue as well. I may have got a bad batch</li>
    <li> Just love this wonderful shaving cream almost as much as I enjoy the convenience of amazon.  This is not normally on store shelves.</li>
    <li> It is what it is- no major comments. The only thing I could mention is that it&#x27;s very watery &amp; runny the first couple times I use it... probably the first 1/4 at least, before it gets foamy. Whatever.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine - it works. I&#x27;m not really sure why Amazon is making me review it. I mean - it&#x27;s shaving cream, c&#x27;mon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product and its predecessors for a very long time. A few years ago I noticed that some batches were too watery. Now it looks like seven-eight cans out of ten contain foam that is so runny that it&#x27;s hardly usable. I suspect they have changed ingredients, and this reflects in the profound drop of the product quality. Why it wasn&#x27;t picked up by their QC department and corrected remains a mystery to me.</li>
    <li> What a great deal for the price you pay for buying in bulk.  This will last our family for 1 year !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for some time now and I just realized I was able to get it in bulk packs and subscription services. I hate going out to the store to buy things like this (mainly because I wait until I&#x27;m out), so the subscription is good. If you are like me with 5 men in the house, you can probably use the six cans pretty easily. We aren&#x27;t even that hairy of a bunch, so your mileage may vary based on your level of wolverinism and the number  people you have.     In terms of the cream itself, I&#x27;m a big fan of foam over gel as you don&#x27;t have to wait for it to foam, you get a better idea of how much you are using and I think it works better to lubricate and hydrate the face. Gillette&#x27;s is good at all that. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but I&#x27;ve always used this because it seems easier on my face and it provides for a smooth shave.     Everything said the cream itself is great, but a 6pk is a lot of shaving cream. Great if you have a lot of guys around (better yet if they are particularly hairy).</li>
    <li> Just so everyone knows, this is a very liquid foam (that quickly stiffens), not the gel that I anticipated.  It works fine, but I have used and liked Gillette gel for several years and thought I had bought a six-pack of gel.  Should have read the description.</li>
    <li> I switched to the gel style shave products many moons ago when they first became popular. Then recently, by accident, I picked one of   these Gillete foam styles off the store shelf. Because I didn&#x27;t realize my mistake until a couple of weeks later, I decided to use it. I was pleasantly surprised to discover how much closer and easier it shaved compared to the gels. I tried brand B foam later and it seemed to be more air less moisture. The Gillete product does come out less puffed up, which is due, I&#x27;m speculating, to a higher moisture content. So the Gillette Foam is now my daily shave product.</li>
    <li> Very Pleased, no issues</li>
    <li> I wish that I had not purchased this product. It only comes out as a watery liquid - no sign of &#x27;foam&#x27; or even &#x27;gel.&#x27; If I could give it a zero star review, I would. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT - you would be sorely disappointed. I&#x27;m just going to trash the remaining five cans and write them off...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m buying this set of 6 shaving creams for my husband for the 2nd time....if he didn&#x27;t like the cream he would have said not to purchase again. At $2.99 per can it is slightly higher than if I were to wait for it to go on sale at CVS or Rite Aid but because of the convenience of home delivery the extra .10 per can is more than worth it for me. I think it smells good and my husband is happy with how it shaves....so there you have it, not exactly a rave review but definitely a \\&quot;thumbs up\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Cheers</li>
    <li> I love this cream. I have sensitive skin andi am prone to razor burn. I have yet to get razor burn using this. I bought a bulk pack and gave a few cans to people around me.</li>
    <li> I like it, but I like the gel more.  This works great, but I just like the gel formula better.  Gillette still though.</li>
    <li> Instead of producing billowing foam, these canisters produce a stream of liquid. I&#x27;ve also bought the gel version of this product and have endured quality control problems. You&#x27;d be wise to choose a different brand.</li>
    <li> My order was shipped by Amazon in excellent time. I was happy to receive it although it actually was more expensive than the local WalMart but they seldom have it. I do not like the Shaving Gel which is why I ordered a five year supply of Shaving Foam which fits into my shaving kit for traveling as well Thank You</li>
    <li> No Complaints about this shaving gel.  It defintely lasts a long time and serves a purpose.  It is simple and effective.</li>
    <li> I expected a foam to be present based on the description. But I got liquid cream which is difficult to hold and apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waster of money :-(,</li>
    <li> good stuff (18 more words required) OK it is good stuff. (8 more words required) it is real good stuff</li>
    <li> This is the only product that made by Gellette that works well fo me.</li>
    <li> It prevents my skin from getting cut, and it doesn&#x27;t take much to apply. A thin coat protects my skin well. The smell is manly and not too strong, and the product is great being used with either a manual razor or an electric razor.</li>
    <li> I love gilette products.  When I purchased this product felt it would work just like the rest of the products that I have purchased.  When depressing the button, the foam comes out watery.  Not very good</li>
    <li> You really need to shake these bad boys otherwise you get a liquid vs. a foam.  They are cheap enough that I don&#x27;t mind but they are not as good as the higher priced shaving gels.</li>
    <li> LEAVES RUST SPOTS ALLOVER.CAN NOT PUT UPSIDE DOWN IN THE BATHTUB BECAUSE OF DEFECTIVE CAP.CAP MUST BE MODIFIED BEFORE I BUY THE PRODUCT AGAIN.PRODUCT GOOD.CAP DESIGN SUCKS.!!!!</li>
    <li> Product I received - six cans - was garbage. All I got out of the can was a liquid stream which had little semblance to shaving cream. Total waste. I have written Gillette in an attempt to get replacement product I will let the community know how they respond.</li>
    <li> Been using these for years now.  A little goes a long way.  Comes out like water then foams up.  This is important to note so that you do not dispense too much after thinking there was no foam coming out.  I find it better to shake the can 2 or 3 times (not excessively) to make it foam up quicker.</li>
    <li> Same stuff you get in the store just for about half the price of driving in to get it. Plus this way you always have some and never have that awkward moment when your&#x27;e out</li>
    <li> I use gel all the time and my wife by accident got me this foam it not even good for the kids to put on the table to write their spelling words in it. This foam washes away fast with just a drop of water.</li>
    <li> I mistook this for Gillette shaving gel. I don&#x27;t prefer using shaving foam. The smell is plain soapy and bad.</li>
    <li> for the price you cant beat it and the quantity is great i wont have to buy this stuff for a while but when i do i know where to look thanks</li>
    <li> And now I order 6 cans of FOAM and only got 4 cans of foal and 2 cans of gel (that I cannot use). Do people pay attention anymore? Sad.</li>
    <li> This stuff is classic, works great and is impossible to find anymore even in the million drugstores of NYC. I hope they are not dis-continuing the product. It seems only the razor-clogging gels are being sold in NYC these days, so I had to buy 6 cans of these just so I could get what I wanted!</li>
    <li> I like the gel shave creams better than the foam ones.  This stuff is just not as thick an smooth as Gillette&#x27;s series of gels.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to buy my usual shaving foam (Barbasol) here on amazon.com without paying shipping and handling because for some reason only outside vendors carry it, so I decided to give something else a try, and this seemed like the best value. I haven&#x27;t experienced any of the watery issues that some other reviewers have, and I wonder if it&#x27;s perhaps because I hold the can upside down and shake vigourously before each use. Take note, this is a foam, not a gel, and it comes out all foam. I use it on my face and my head, and it does the job, with no bad smell or irritation. Not much you can say...it&#x27;s shaving foam. It is what it is.</li>
    <li> Average cheap shaving cream.  Buy the better stuff if you want a better shave.  Too bad I bought a six pack, I&#x27;m stuck for a while.</li>
    <li> This is just a silly product.&lt;br /&gt;It is dispensed as a gel and then foams with body heat.  It might seem attractive, but it really does not work well, and the lubrication it provides is fair at best.  For a good value, the old-fashioned, tried-and-true foams such as Barbasol are much better.</li>
