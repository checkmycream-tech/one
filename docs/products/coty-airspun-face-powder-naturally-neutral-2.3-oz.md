    <li> seriously made me start to break out. I liked the way it smells - the feel and the box, but yeah clogged my pores.</li>
    <li> Ever since I was a little girl and I watched my mom and grandmother use this in the morning, I&#x27;ve been in love with just the smell of this loose weight powder. Now, as a young woman, I still am in love with not only the smell, but how much coverage you get with this powder! But that&#x27;s not even the best part. The best part is that this loose powder is so light weight that you feel so natural!</li>
    <li> I have used Coty powder at least 50 years.  I love it and it sets my foundation to last all day.  I do have trouble finding it, so am pleased to be able to find it through  Amazon.  I am so pleased that I can still find it.</li>
    <li> Product was good however it was not in the original package and not mafe in USA.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff its just like I remembered! I will definitely be repurchasing again once this runs out I love it!</li>
    <li> This powder is just as I remember from years ago. Lightweight with a bit of soft coverage.</li>
    <li> this is one of the best powders on the market and you dont have to spend an arm and a leg. great coverage and finish</li>
    <li> perrenial favorite i go back to....kind of sad that the packaging is less eco friendly than previously...wish they&#x27;d go back to the cardboard.</li>
    <li> Love this powder! Have used it for years. Best face powder there is but hard to find in stores anymore. Thankful Amazon has it!</li>
    <li> Ditto all previous reviews. I do use or need foundation when I use this powder.excellent flawless coverage. I am 60 years old. I did buy this at Walmart for 5.83. Sorry Amazon.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my mother and she said it was great, and price was more than fair. could not find it anywhere else and wanted that same product. She told me she will order more when she needs it.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my 94 year old aunt, who by the way, is still so beautiful.  she was very happy with it, so I was very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Coty Airspun Face Powder, naturally neutral; was exactly what I wanted.  I received it in good time which pleased me very much.  Thank you for your prompt response to my request</li>
    <li> what I received is not NATURALLY NEUTRAL shade I ordered. it&#x27;s just NATURELLE.it&#x27;s white like a flour!!!!.same as this one http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BRO6O8/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o06_s01_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
    <li> I have used Coty for years.  Love the texture, coverage and smell.  It goes on evenly and helps keep my make up fresh looking all day long.</li>
    <li> I wanted to receive the original in the cardboard container.  another reviewer said it was the cardboard container. I WAS VER DISAPPOINTED.</li>
    <li> My mother really likes this.&lt;br /&gt;And the price was very reasonable comparing with Korea.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you. Today has a nice weather.</li>
    <li> I ordered 3 boxes of this powder and when I received it, I discovered that labels had been placed over the original shade description on each box.  I didn&#x27;t think much about it until I opened the first box and it was definitely a different shade than what I had ordered.  The powder I received is an almost flat white instead of the ivory color I ordered.  I have pale skin so I&#x27;m making do with this almost white shade of powder.  If Coty is discontinuing the ivory shade of powder, then why not tell the customer up front?  I can use this powder but I&#x27;m really not satisfied with the almost white shade.  It&#x27;s too much trouble to mail it back with a complaint plus absorb the cost of postage.  This time you win and I lost!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an addition to my original review, I checked the powder and sure enough, it was made in China.  Well, that explains why the shade of powder was wrong and only the Chinese know for sure what ingredients went into the powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will no longer purchase Coty powder because it is now manufactured in China!!!</li>
    <li> I like this powder better than any other I&#x27;ve used</li>
