      <li>but I use these between all my teeth and these do a great job!</li>
      <li>An excellent help if you have any spaces or pockets between your teeth.</li>
      <li>These refills are perfect for cleaning between your teeth.</li>
      <li>These do an excellent job</li>
      <li>They work great for cleaning around the braces without hurting them.</li>
      <li>It is a great habit to get into though.</li>
      <li>Great for oral hygiene.</li>
      <li>They are great for getting out plaque between the teeth,</li>
      <li>These work very effectively in cleaning between you teeth.</li>
      <li>They are sold here at a good price and do what they advertise</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a good product.  </li>
      <li>The product arrived as scheduled and was in good shape.</li>
      <li>used these for years, works great, easy to use</li>
      <li>If they fit more securely, they&#x27;d be perfect!</li>
      <li>I am glad Amazon had them.</li>
      <li>the shipping packaging is most of the weight.  </li>
      <li>These brushes are satisfactory however there is a better brush made by GUM.  </li>
      <li>I was pleased to be able to purchase them on line.</li>
      <li>and I was so glad to find a source.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as easy as flossing and way more costly.</li>
      <li>Got the fine brushes.</li>
      <li>The product, GUM Go Between Proxabrush Tight Refills-8ct, which I have used before, is excellent as well.</li>
      <li>Perfect for those tight spots.</li>
      <li>I requested brushes that are not tapered and received tapered brushes that fit baby teeth.  </li>
      <li>The G.U.M. Proxabrush number is 414, but it has the smallest diameter of any Proxabrush still made and feels like the original number 412 in use</li>
      <li>My normal routine is to floss, use the interdental in most spaces, then use a Waterpik, followed by an Oral B powered brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Well, their are meant to clean the gaps between your teeth, and that is exactly what they do.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pretty cool scrub brush for the teeth and gums.</li>
      <li>right in.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I will order more from the same vendor when the refills run out.</li>
      <li>She originally gave me some of the WIDE interdental brushes which worked fine for larger gaps, but the #414 \\&quot;Tight\\&quot; works for more of my gaps.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d probably go with Moderate for a better fit in the larger gaps.</li>
      <li>thje extra fine brushes.</li>
      <li>Finally gave up an accepted fine brushes.</li>
      <li>The brush part is fine, but the wire is so narrow it doesn&#x27;t stay in my holder securely.  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>For me these work far better than flossing and take much less time.</li>
      <li>It is charged at almost exactly the price of the product regardless of quantity purchased, even though they are so small and light that postage for eight 8-packs would be only slightly higher than for one -</li>
      <li>WOW!</li>
      <li>Fit between tight teeth.</li>
      <li>The wires are pretty weak, and easily bent, but that&#x27;s unavoidable if it&#x27;s going to fit into tight spaces.</li>
      <li>The wire core seems much thinner and bends so easily that it makes them difficult to use.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re supposed to be changed weekly, and I can generally get a week&#x27;s worth of use out of one, despite having some teeth that are both very close, and slightly crooked, so it&#x27;s a guessing game inserting the wire at just the correct angle to slide</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These were recommended by my daughter&#x27;s orthodontist after getting braces, but could not find this size in the store. I am glad Amazon had them. They work great for cleaning around the braces without hurting them.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product when you have a bridge, but I use these between all my teeth and these do a great job!</li>
    <li> Fit between tight teeth. These are hard to find in Walmart, CVS, etc. They are sold here at a good price and do what they advertise</li>
    <li> I am looking for the proxabrush 412 refills but I cannot see the item number on this image and it is not specified in the text.</li>
    <li> The G.U.M. Proxabrush number is 414, but it has the smallest diameter of any Proxabrush still made and feels like the original number 412 in use (I used them side by side for comparison).  For me these work far better than flossing and take much less time.</li>
    <li> Just what I need,hard to find.</li>
    <li> weird packaging, but it&#x27;s a good product.  if you want to avoid gingivitis and a trip to the periodontist...get these and use them.</li>
    <li> An excellent help if you have any spaces or pockets between your teeth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been alarmed by the reviews on various sellers&#x27; sites saying they had ordered cylindrical and received tapered. I ordered these in August and did receive cylindrical brush tips, as pictured. The wires are pretty weak, and easily bent, but that&#x27;s unavoidable if it&#x27;s going to fit into tight spaces. They&#x27;re supposed to be changed weekly, and I can generally get a week&#x27;s worth of use out of one, despite having some teeth that are both very close, and slightly crooked, so it&#x27;s a guessing game inserting the wire at just the correct angle to slide right in.&lt;br /&gt;I use a Proxabrush with the conical tip at one end for wide spaces, and the cylindrical one at the other end.</li>
    <li> Not what I wanted, I&lt;br /&gt;wanted thje extra fine brushes. Got the fine brushes. Finally gave up an accepted fine brushes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty cool scrub brush for the teeth and gums. It&#x27;s not as easy as flossing and way more costly. It is a great habit to get into though.</li>
    <li> The brush part is fine, but the wire is so narrow it doesn&#x27;t stay in my holder securely.  If they fit more securely, they&#x27;d be perfect!</li>
    <li> Well, their are meant to clean the gaps between your teeth, and that is exactly what they do. So, I gave them 5 stars!</li>
    <li> used these for years, works great, easy to use</li>
    <li> Works well for only one cleaning.  Somewhat too flexible in hard to clean tight areas between teeth. Use routinely after flossing daily.</li>
    <li> There seems to have been a \\&quot;redesign\\&quot; (cost reduction?) since the last ones of these we had.  The wire core seems much thinner and bends so easily that it makes them difficult to use.  My other gripe is that shipping cost was excessive.  It is charged at almost exactly the price of the product regardless of quantity purchased, even though they are so small and light that postage for eight 8-packs would be only slightly higher than for one - the shipping packaging is most of the weight.  Yet shipping for eight 8-packs was almost four times what it would have been for two.</li>
    <li> I prefer &amp;#34;ULTRA tight&amp;#34; proxabrushes, model 871, also made by GUM. In contrast, the picture for these &amp;#34;414 Tight&amp;#34; brushes shows a pipe-cleaner shape, but I received a Christmas tree shape. (Brushes which are too wide can actually hurt your gums as you push them between your teeth.)</li>
    <li> These work very effectively in cleaning between you teeth. A lot easier with less mess than dental floss. I dip the end in peroxide and go between each tooth. Front and back, rinse with a little mouth wash. Then I just brush as usual. Works for me. WOW!</li>
    <li> I requested brushes that are not tapered and received tapered brushes that fit baby teeth.  They are too tiny for adults.  I will not purchase brushes from you again.</li>
    <li> These brushes are satisfactory however there is a better brush made by GUM.  Will use this brush refill when can&#x27;t get the other one.</li>
    <li> I use these with the Oral B interdental holder that my hygienist gave me. She originally gave me some of the WIDE interdental brushes which worked fine for larger gaps, but the #414 \\&quot;Tight\\&quot; works for more of my gaps. There are still a lot of spaces that these will not fit, so I recommend using regular floss as well as a Waterpik in conjunction with these interdental brushes. My normal routine is to floss, use the interdental in most spaces, then use a Waterpik, followed by an Oral B powered brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 5/5 stars, as advertised - may not fit in the tightest gaps, but works for 90% of my teeth. I&#x27;d probably go with Moderate for a better fit in the larger gaps.</li>
    <li> The product arrived as scheduled and was in good shape. These refills are perfect for cleaning between your teeth. I will order more from the same vendor when the refills run out.</li>
    <li> I have been using tight fit proxabrushes for several years and have found them increasingly difficult to find in my local pharmacies. I was pleased to be able to purchase them on line. I will reorder in the future as needed. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Great for oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> I have looked in all of the local stores and, previously,  have found these only at Walmart. The last time i needed to replenish my supply, they were not available there. I use these twice a day as I tend to accumulate particles around the base of my teeth and find floss or a Water Pic awkward to manipulate. These do an excellent job and I was so glad to find a source.</li>
    <li> This order was well serviced and on time.  The product, GUM Go Between Proxabrush Tight Refills-8ct, which I have used before, is excellent as well.</li>
    <li> Everything as promised. In fact, they arrived one day earlier than expected. Well done! They are great for getting out plaque between the teeth,</li>
    <li> The picture and description showed the go-betweens were for tight spaces (product #412).  The item received was for medium spaces (product #414).  I kept them only because the cost to return them was not worth it.</li>
    <li> Dentist recommended using the brushes on my bridges.  The brushes he gave me were too big so I read up on them and found these through Amazon.  They are alot smaller wire size but have a biger brush head.  Perfect for those tight spots.</li>
