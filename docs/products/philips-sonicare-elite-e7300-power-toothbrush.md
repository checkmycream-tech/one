      <li>it is great.</li>
      <li>Great customer service</li>
      <li>The Philips Sonicare Elite e7300 Power Toothbrush from Philips Sonicare is a great toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>This is great.</li>
      <li>Ever since receiving my Philips Sonicare Elite 7300 toothbrush for Christmas a couple of years ago, I have come to expect great products from the Philips Corporation.</li>
      <li>My teeth feel great</li>
      <li>It has truly helped a great deal.</li>
      <li>This toothbrush is great, it is like goning to the Dentist evry day.</li>
      <li>It IS Great.</li>
      <li>Everyone is oohing and ahhing over the toothbrush&#x27;s great performance</li>
      <li>Sonicare works great and cleans your teeth well.  </li>
      <li>I have been extremely happy with Sonicare&#x27;s cleaning results (we even bought our children the Essence model).     </li>
      <li>Absolutely love this toothbrush!!  </li>
      <li>This is a very nice product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing the difference!</li>
      <li>All sonicare power toothbrushes are amazing!  </li>
      <li>I never timed my brushing before, but I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s the best way to keep your teeth healthy.  </li>
      <li>I had a Sonicare for years but this model is better than before, it stays charged for days without charging (when traveling), it cleanes  great!</li>
      <li>Top notch wonderful for keeping the kids brushing.  </li>
      <li>On the bright side, it comes with a very nice travel case.</li>
      <li>very quick way to do an excellent brushing job.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a great product and a great value, it will provide many years of use and preventative care for your teeth.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
      <li>It did a good job, but the sonicare is in a league of</li>
      <li>suppose these are good toothbrushes.  </li>
      <li>This is a good investment.</li>
      <li>And it is surprisingly</li>
      <li>I have always loved to brush my teeth.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s good to know that you have the option.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
      <li>Sounded good to me</li>
      <li>Well both are good brushes than manual brushing.</li>
      <li>I look forward to brushing my teeth and am amazed at how good my mouth feels after using the brush each morning.</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;re good for a month&#x27;s vacation.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;d be wise to purchase one if your kids are rather lax in their care, eat candy (even if they have to sneak to the neighbors&#x27; house to get it) and need to be watched like a hawk to get them to brush</li>
      <li>If so, this is a wise investment.</li>
      <li>But then again, clean teeth are priceless.    </li>
      <li>Teeth feel a great deal cleaner and it charges and cleans up very easily.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an engineer, and this may be the most beautiful machine I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
      <li>It does an exceptional job of cleaning the backs of the teeth and well as the front surfaces.  </li>
      <li>I bought my Sonicare Elite a couple of months ago &amp;amp; am very satisfied with the results.</li>
      <li>and I am very pleased.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>Even with all these shortcomings, elite 7300 is a great dental hygiene product that was way better than manual brushing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so great to be able to read reviews.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with that.  </li>
      <li>This product is highly effective at cleaning and maintaining a happy healthy smile.&lt;br</li>
      <li>If there is a better brush buy it, but my experience shows the original Sonicare works great!</li>
      <li>I love this toothbrush!</li>
      <li>The difference in the two exam&#x27;s results was phenomenal!</li>
      <li>she couldn&#x27;t find any more to scale, and she was so amazed she brought in the dentist! &lt;</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I LOVE it!  </li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>I have to agree that it does an amazing job.  </li>
      <li>Also, if you&#x27;re the type of person that likes to see your teeth while you&#x27;re brushing, the vibration force of the brush will cause you to get speckles of toothpaste to fly on your mirror, which is a huge pet-peeve of my moms.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of tingly, but you do get used to it.</li>
      <li>Kind of like when the dentist cleans your teeth.     </li>
      <li>The 2 speed settings are nice, but I&#x27;ll never use them.    </li>
      <li>The timer that tells you to change sections of your mouth is nice too.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own.      </li>
      <li>I can honestly say that in 6+ years, there was never a hint of a mold problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have had my braces off for more than a year (no post-braces cavities), and the dental hygienists still remark on what good health my teeth are in because of the Sonicare toothbrush I use.    </li>
      <li>I really liked the QuadPacer feature and basically went looking for the cheapest model that had the QP.</li>
      <li>So I bought the e7300 (after much searching, Amazon had the best price).</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s kindof nice for hygenical purposes though.</li>
      <li>Amazon was as fast an efficent as always and their price was the best.</li>
      <li>but I will say, with no reservations, that this is the absolute best toothbrush I have ever used.</li>
      <li>We now own 3 of these toothbrushes.  </li>
      <li>What kind of engineering is this?</li>
      <li>Theunit has a pacer that makes sure you spend 30 seconds on each of the 4 sections of your mouth, which is good because it forces you to brush correctly.</li>
      <li>The case is a nice touch for traveling-</li>
      <li>I liked the way it cleaned</li>
      <li>The angled head is great, and does a wonderful job cleaning your back teeth.  </li>
      <li>Nice people, but no offer to replace the unit.  </li>
      <li>I tried to follow the instructions to replace the battery on my own</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t own one of these, you should.  </li>
      <li>Clean teeth feels great.    </li>
      <li>You know the one, you put in a couple of AA batteries and it supposedly gives you a great clean.  </li>
      <li>Truthfully, this is a marvelous instrument for getting and maintaining healthy teeth and most importantly gums.</li>
      <li>then this is a good toothbrush and will keep your chompers squeaky clean!</li>
      <li>While it&#x27;s true, it does a great job of cleaning teeth</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s also very easy to take apart for road trips.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use -</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had a Sonicare toothbrush of one kind or another for many years.</li>
      <li>This one is the best so far.</li>
      <li>So now we bought the 7300 series and my husband  told  me he liked it better then the 5500 series.  </li>
      <li>She waltzes in and out of the dentist now with virtually no plaque, no sign of gum disease and a great smile.  </li>
      <li>I love that it runs on a segmented timer to keep me honest about the time I spend brushing.    </li>
      <li>I had expressed to my parents that I wanted a good electric toothbrush because I feel that taking care of my teeth is extremely important.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if the Oral B product is designed more effectively</li>
      <li>I bought an inexpensive electric toothbrush first just to see if I liked the idea compared with hand brushing, and was quite happy with it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the toothbrush, its easy to use</li>
      <li>We owned the original Sonicare for years and we loved it.  </li>
      <li>if you have a great set of teeth and never had problems using regular toothbrushes, you might not find great value in this.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t delude yourself - sonic brushes can&#x27;t clean between the teeth despite the fantastic marketing claims about the &#x27;ultrasonic technology&#x27; lol.</li>
      <li>My husband also found that it worked for him too - it&#x27;s very light and the handle is well shaped for him to hold.  </li>
      <li>Now, my last 3 checkups have been flawless.</li>
      <li>You should be able to replace the rechargeable battery.    </li>
      <li>It is much better.</li>
      <li>I have noticed my boyfriend&#x27;s teeth look much better as well.  </li>
      <li>He also seems to brush his teeth more with this one.</li>
      <li>That means it&#x27;s in the top tier of Sonicare products.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a better unit.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the way my teeth feel after using this toothbrush.</li>
      <li>The instructions describe how to remove the battery so that it may be safely recycled, but that&#x27;s all.  </li>
      <li>Many people have to use humidifiers (I don&#x27;t use one) to keep the house</li>
      <li>After all, I think most people are like me and want to focus on maintaining their TEETH - not their toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>After all, I think most people are like me and want to focus on maintaining their TEETH - not their toothbrush.    </li>
      <li>I have used this product before and have had fantastic results with it!</li>
      <li>Upon my dentist&#x27;s recommendation, I bought a Sonicare toothbrush when I got braces more than 3 years ago.  </li>
      <li>I love the way it cleans my teeth</li>
      <li>one year after my purchase, the top button made of rub wore away.</li>
      <li>I never thought I&#x27;d be so verbose over a toothbrush, but these are phenomenal.  </li>
      <li>I love my Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>I love this tootbrush.  </li>
      <li>Need I say more?</li>
      <li>Make sure to use the travel case it comes with if you plan to take it on overnight trips.</li>
      <li>It does a better job with brushing than a manual toothbrush.</li>
      <li>Stays charged for weeks and brushes so much better that the Crest battery brush</li>
      <li>Love both of the Sonicares.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a lot more bang for your buck.</li>
      <li>Love this product, I am so glad that I listened to my dentist and ordered this product.</li>
      <li>Philips Sonicare Elite has been my favorite power toothbrush for over 10 years now.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE this tooth brush.</li>
      <li>but this feature also keeps me more mindful of HOW I&#x27;m brushing my teeth.</li>
      <li>mind you... :)  </li>
      <li>I purchased this Model after reading reviews about the various models and have been very happy with the purchase.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE this toothbrush.</li>
      <li>My gums feel better and the massage you can give them with this toothbrush is quite a treat.  </li>
      <li>I love my Sonicare e7300.  </li>
      <li>It really does a great job cleaning and without damaging my gums.</li>
      <li>Manual brushing can&#x27;t achieve so many strokes/minute like the sonic type brushes.</li>
      <li>You will need flosing, interdental brushes or better water jet for that.</li>
      <li>and I think it does a better job cleaning my teeth than the Oral-B I used before buying this product.</li>
      <li>B0013TVEWA Philips Sonicare Flexcare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush]] series seems to solve most of the issues that I faced with the elite series.</li>
      <li>I have been a Sonicare fan for many years.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Since I have no experience with others, I cannot tell you unequivocally that Sonicare&#x27;s better than its competitors.  </li>
      <li>I am really glad I made the change.  </li>
      <li>I have taken my Elite for trips in excess of two weeks, using it twice most days.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried the battery operated brushes, which are just OK.  </li>
      <li>Buy one for everyone you love.  </li>
      <li>Sonicare claims that the Elite is actually better from a functional point of view and I cannot say otherwise, so I will give them the benefit of the doubt.  </li>
      <li>have found one interesting thing...</li>
      <li>But, then I lost dental insurance, and wanted to be able to keep my teeth cleaner between visits, so started shopping Amazon again.  </li>
      <li>so I can make sure I&#x27;m getting all the areas and am angling the brush correctly (they recommend keeping it at around a 30 degree angle to your tooth surface), so in the beginning I would drool toothpaste foam each time.</li>
      <li>Over all, though, its a top notch product.</li>
      <li>faster brush; lighter handle; and tapered to reach backsides of teeth much better.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this toothbrush and it truly makes a difference when used daily.</li>
      <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
      <li>So much better than the model before it.</li>
      <li>I bought an Elite 7500 model because that&#x27;s what the store had, but I don&#x27;t think there were many differences in the 7300 and the 7500.</li>
      <li>I wish I&#x27;d had this toothbrush a year or more ago.</li>
      <li>I love the \\&quot;massage\\&quot; feeling while I&#x27;m brushing too.</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;m sure that every part of my mouth is getting the attention it deserves.</li>
      <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>Too many reviews;   </li>
      <li>THIS costs three times more than THAT.   </li>
      <li>I am completely satisfied.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>My wife, for example, can&#x27;t stand the vibrating brush while I love it</li>
      <li>but I doubt that &#x27;something better&#x27; exists today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d like it better with plastic all-over.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
      <li>I find that I brush better with it, targeting spots that I hadn&#x27;t before with a manual toothbrush.</li>
      <li>and he needed to brush more</li>
      <li>After 3 months he went back to the dentist and they gave him an excellent report.</li>
      <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
      <li>My wife and I both love them and I use one just for my business travel</li>
      <li>We both love this toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>and i found this one to be much better.</li>
      <li>With this toothbrush, he is able to get all the plague from around his gumline so that his teeth do not bleed anymore when brushing or flossing.   </li>
      <li>How many electric products can you use twice-a-day for 3 1/2 years without replacing them?  </li>
      <li>br /&gt;We are so satisfied with this product that we don&#x27;t flinch at the price of the replacement heads.  </li>
      <li>The Sonicare design provides much more power and durability.  </li>
      <li>whatever it is called) is a must and makes brushing your teeth much more</li>
      <li>Just make sure it&#x27;s topped off</li>
      <li>My cousin Jenny, who is in her second year in dental school, said that buying a Sonicare toothbrush was the best thing you could do for your teeth as recommended by her professors and colleagues, so my mom thought that I might as well try it and be the guinea pig of the family.    </li>
      <li>I also love the fact that the toothbrush has the quad pacer.</li>
      <li>Love it for 6 years.  </li>
      <li>Glad I made the switch to Sonicare.</li>
      <li>My kids, who both have a mouthful of braces, use this toothbrush as well and both love it.</li>
      <li>but I already love it.</li>
      <li>With the latest research indicating that tooth decay raises one&#x27;s risk of HEART disease, this item may truly be a lifesaver, not just a way to stave off cavities.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does more than we can do ourselves</li>
      <li>and I love the \\&quot;timer\\&quot; aspect.</li>
      <li>dont get the  \\&quot;Better</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know about most people</li>
      <li>but it isn&#x27;t watertight so despite best efforts stuff will get into the inner part of the brush/magnet unit that is factory sealed (I&#x27;m not talking about the removable threaded part that screws into the handle).</li>
      <li>After using the Oral B now for about 2 month I have the feeling that the Oral B cleans my teeth better</li>
      <li>I know that the expense puts this toothbrush out of reach for many people.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product, does a great job of preventing decay and other tooth problems when used  twice a day as directed.</li>
      <li>This Elite sonicare really looks after your teeth in a very nice way.  </li>
      <li>but it was kind of a hassle to prep and clean.</li>
      <li>Like the older Sonicare line, this does a great job of cleaning your teath.  </li>
      <li>After brushing for the programmed 2 minutes, your teeth feel very clean and refreshed.  </li>
      <li>Your teeth and mouth feel very clean.  </li>
      <li>I bought mine originally from an Amazon Marketplace vendor, and I was able to get a great price, much lower than buying it in the store.  </li>
      <li>I just bought my new Sonicare and it works great.    </li>
      <li>I love the toothbrush, although it does have a strong buzzing vibration to it.    </li>
      <li>More important than just cleaning your teeth, it helps maintain healthy gums.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a bit neurotic about cleanliness myself, and I have found it to be very easy to clean and quite sanitary.    </li>
      <li>Very easy to use, maintain and keep clean.  </li>
      <li>The Sonic Care makes my teeth feel so clean!  </li>
      <li>and this toothbrush gets my teeth really clean!  </li>
      <li>You will tongue your teeth more because they will feel smooth and polished.&lt;br /&gt;Okay</li>
      <li>Most importantly is the size and shape of the head.  </li>
      <li>It looks to be more cheaply made.</li>
      <li>, it is lighter, and much more comfortable.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t speak to its durability yet, but I&#x27;m happy so far with its design and how it cleans my teeth.</li>
      <li>Actually, great brushing action.  </li>
      <li>A friend has the 7300 and the ergonomic design of the handle and skinner brush head makes it really much more comfortable.  </li>
      <li>and I really feel good whit this tooth brush.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fast and good quality.</li>
      <li>But this toothbrush is better than my original:  </li>
      <li>COOL!     </li>
      <li>for a full charge!</li>
      <li>The Sonicare Elite e7300 power toothbrush is a wonderful product which cleans your teeth extremely well.  </li>
      <li>It came real quick and I love it more than the first two I had.</li>
      <li>Clean your teeth with SOUND WAVES!</li>
      <li>I would have given this toothbrush 5 stars easily if it weren&#x27;t for the cleaning issue.</li>
      <li>I used to just brush my tongue, but that is not so easily done with this brush.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and easy to charge.  </li>
      <li>Now I got that out of the way, I love this brush, its like coming out of the dentist after a teeth clean.    </li>
      <li>It says you get two weeks&#x27; use out of one charge, to make it easy to travel with it.  </li>
      <li>Just make sure to clean it as per the maintenance instructions</li>
      <li>and I like the slim head which is easy to maneuver around the teeth.  </li>
      <li>It is extremely easy to operate and program.</li>
      <li>Can you think of anything better then that dentist clean feel?</li>
      <li>but they were easy to put together and we charged them up the 24 hours they required.  </li>
      <li>Easy to read battery meter shows when recharging is needed.  </li>
      <li>family, however, needs all the help it can get, with teeth that decay easily, even if we avoid sweets.</li>
      <li>It has a nice \\&quot;learning\\&quot; feature that starts the brush out at a fairly gentle aggitation and moves to the most vigorous level over the course of 15 day to give the novice user a chance to acclimate to the vibrating head (it can tickle quite a bit if you&#x27;re not used to it).  </li>
      <li>I have a lower brace that tends to collect plaque and my gums would easily bleed at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
      <li>(We have another Advantage that is going strong after around four or five years).</li>
      <li>- the vibrations were too strong</li>
      <li>Perhaps you&#x27;ve got strong teeth.</li>
      <li>At first, the buzzing was VERY strong, which kind of made it funny to watch my sister get the giggles (if you are ticklish, WATCH OUT!)</li>
      <li>Appears to do a fine job brushing my teeth, and is quite easy to use.</li>
      <li>At first I thought that maybe spending $100 on a toothbrush seemed liked a lot, but then I realized that these are my teeth</li>
      <li>and I believe the claims that the Elite is 20% more effective than older models.  </li>
      <li>it seems, I loved this thing and every time i put on a new brush head</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s as good as (almost) new today.</li>
      <li>The others worked fine but eventually the batterys started to wear out</li>
      <li>7300 does not come with any of that, and works just fine.  </li>
      <li>- it&#x27;s fine just the way it is.</li>
      <li>Despite my best efforts with my previous electric brush, all too often it would take two appointments just for a routine cleaning.</li>
      <li>One of the cheaper brands will work just fine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sturdy and latches fine and the plastic in the hinges is made to benda lot.</li>
      <li>Lucky me, I got to have one, too!  </li>
      <li>I am sure it will enhance the dental treatments he has received and will make him feel more confident as he meets new people.</li>
      <li>Use this along with those little brushes that go between teeth to get rid of plaque, and you will be very happy.  </li>
      <li>My teeth feel smooth and my mouth feels refreshed.</li>
      <li>It focuses on the brush stem and bristles, while the mold is in a sort of \\&quot;cavern\\&quot; that the light won&#x27;t reach.  </li>
      <li>was entirely of smooth plastic.  </li>
      <li>About 2 years ago, my dental hygenist recommended this toothbrush to me, and I didn&#x27;t buy it at the time, because I didn&#x27;t really want to spend that kind of money on a toothbrush.</li>
      <li>Sonicare who confirmed it did not work</li>
      <li>Sonicare who confirmed it did not work</li>
      <li>But after a change, the 1st and the 2nd brush is still great.</li>
      <li>if you know physics, you know vibration through a medium produces sound) and battery life.  </li>
      <li>works great, teeth feel cleaner than with a regular tooth brush.</li>
      <li>Just a fabulous design.</li>
      <li>The instructions specify how to clean under the nut easily (the brush head pops out).</li>
      <li>After 14 years, my sonicare has finally gone off to the great dentist in the sky.</li>
      <li>Easy on gums, gets teeth clean.   </li>
      <li>At my last 6-month checkup, my dentist literally exclaimed with joy at the lack of tartar build up, and the cleaning itself was a breeze.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;d think that this task could have been made easier with all the technology available.</li>
      <li>I am, however, happy that I finally got one</li>
      <li>You will actually enjoy brushing your teeth - look forward to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>If it&#x27;s not charging, don&#x27;t turn the light on.</li>
      <li>I give it 3 stars for cleaning teeth and 0 stars for arrogant, cheap design and being overpriced.    </li>
      <li>great design allows reaching way back on the molars.</li>
      <li>I am writing this review more from the perspective of whether the Elite is worth $[$$]</li>
      <li>I really do enjoy it -</li>
      <li>Each head has a different colored band around the neck, which is great because you can share it with your partner and keep trackof which head is whose.  </li>
      <li>the hygienest says it&#x27;s so easy for her to clean our teeth because we use the electric toothbrush.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s light weight.  </li>
      <li>(And my primary dentist is NOT known for his raving.)</li>
      <li>My 4700 obviously worked great (and still does), but</li>
      <li>whether cheaper is better,   or price wins the day.     </li>
      <li>it was that great feeling you can&#x27;t get from a regular toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I still feel this is brush quite pricey, but overall I am happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s enough to make any parent happy.</li>
      <li>The 30 second timer does a great job of letting a user know when to move the brush.</li>
      <li>So far so good.  </li>
      <li>Smaller is better in terms of doing a good job of cleaning.</li>
      <li>It may sound like a lot of money for a toothbrush, but it&#x27;s worth way more than what it costs.  </li>
      <li>I am very pleased with my new Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>Just clean the brush before putting it away and you should be fine.    </li>
      <li>I meet compliment me on how white my teeth are and what a great smile I have!</li>
      <li>This toothbrush does a fair job when the brush heads are new; however, they get \\&quot;mushy\\&quot; rather quickly and at $12.50</li>
      <li>It is smaller, easier to handle, does not drip, easier to clean and does  great job on cleaning the teeth and gums</li>
      <li>the new 7300&#x27;s smaller brush and lighter handle are really a perfect fit for me.</li>
      <li>- teeth are cleaner yet not as clean and smooth as after dental cleaning despite the marketing claims.</li>
      <li>I enjoy the invigorating feeling of it, and my mouth just feels so clean afterwards.</li>
      <li>It went strong for a good 10 years before the battery finally quit on me.&lt;br</li>
      <li>There is one significant downside which is that the battery cannot be replaced.  </li>
      <li>The e7300 is lighter and more comfortable than my old 5300, and I think it does a better job cleaning my teeth.    </li>
      <li>The timer effortlessly helps you be more consistent in your brushing behavior.</li>
      <li>The biggest advantage of CVS is the significantly lower price for the unit, which includes the charger, a UV sanitizer and 3 brush heads.</li>
      <li>My dentist reports a significant improvement in plaque.</li>
      <li>off)&lt;br /&gt;Also, after six weeks of usage, one of the magnets on the Elite brush head appears to have rusted significantly.  </li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>But even with the first use, I have to say that my teeth have never felt better or looked cleaner.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re going to make a battery operated toothbrush, you should make the battery  easily accessible to people.  </li>
      <li>My brushing sessions are now more consistent and pain-free and my teeth are noticeably whiter and they feel exceptionally clean.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This really is a great toothbrush, and I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ve managed without it for so long!</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a pain to keep clean.  </li>
      <li>To clean your handle, run a damp cloth around the recessed area once a week.\\</li>
      <li>The toothbrush works well and keeps my teeth clean.</li>
      <li>Yes you do need to clean the tongue, just don&#x27;t gag yourself.      </li>
      <li>and there isn&#x27;t much to clean.</li>
      <li>I can see a noticeable improvement in the color of my teeth and they feel so clean after use.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll have a dentist clean feeling twice a day, without all the poking and prodding.</li>
      <li>Like everything else, take care of it and keep it clean.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how clean my teeth were after 2 minutes.  </li>
      <li>but they were not truly up to the challenge of getting my teeth really clean and stain-free.</li>
      <li>Now to see the same model for 100, anyone who is unsure whether or not it&#x27;s a good investment, I assure you, you will enjoy brushing your teeth.  </li>
      <li>My teeth just don&#x27;t feel clean unless I use my Sonicare.  </li>
      <li>I clean it every morning.</li>
      <li>Not to mention that my mouth didn&#x27;t feel as clean.</li>
      <li>Therefore, every couple of weeks, I clean the well and my brush head with a bleach solution to disinfect and deodorize everything.  </li>
      <li>I have never felt my teeth so thoroughly clean before.  </li>
      <li>It gets my teeth so clean.</li>
      <li>I was very sceptical about spending this kind of money on a toothbrush, but this one is worth it.</li>
      <li>I liked it enough to buy two more for my family</li>
      <li>It give you a dentis clean feel every time you use it.</li>
      <li>how could it give you a dentis clean feel heards</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t describe how clean it makes my mouth feel...</li>
      <li>Each time I use the Sonicare, my mouth feels soooo clean.    </li>
      <li>This toothbrush leaves your mouth feeling clean and invigorated.  </li>
      <li>I would however recommend a newer version of the Sonicare Toothbrush that use the Brush Heads with push on connectors, making it easier to clean and maintain.</li>
      <li>The toothbrush heads&#x27; bristles are curved to get in-between your teeth and to clean the surface of a tooth.</li>
      <li>Their orthodontist has even made comments on how clean their teeth were.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised there aren&#x27;t more complaints from users on how the brushhead&#x27;s design traps toothpaste and mouth gunk (yuck!)</li>
      <li>Just ask any dentist it takes that much time to adequatly message the gums, a very important part of brushing.      </li>
      <li>If he could build a savings account as fast as he builds plaque, we&#x27;d be very comfortable indeed.</li>
      <li>my old handle sayed nice and clean becauseit</li>
      <li>application at home because my teeth were still a bright white almost a year after the in office Zoom!</li>
      <li>This is a GREAT product - we love the small brush head</li>
      <li>, I find it easier to brush for recommended length and really want to make sure I take care of my mouth.  </li>
      <li>The timer also forces me to brush for a full 2 minutes - 30 seconds for each quadrant of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Someone in another review remarked that you can&#x27;t brush your tongue with it, but if you really stiffen your tounge out it cleans it completely, much more efficiently than a manual brush or tongue scraper.  </li>
      <li>Now we both have it full time.</li>
      <li>Just be sure to replace the brush every 6 months, it really does make a difference.  </li>
      <li>More importantly the brush head is smaller and is more of a diamond shape rather than the \\&quot;original\\&quot; rectangle.  </li>
      <li>Good buy especially for the money.  </li>
      <li>He told me that if I didn&#x27;t do something fast, I was going to lose most of my teeth.</li>
      <li>necessary warning: it should be noted that Sonicare is not be good for everyone.</li>
      <li>One full charge should keep you going for one week.</li>
      <li>After all these years of using it twice-daily, it still runs for one week after a full charge.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The tech support guys helped me reset it and told me to leave it on the set for 24+ hours to achieve a full charge.</li>
      <li>It was a good product but only had a life of 18 mos.</li>
      <li>Not bad at all.    </li>
      <li>I bought this toothbrush based on the other good reviews and it was worth it!!  </li>
      <li>The new angled head fit my mouth better</li>
      <li>My only surprise with this one is the brushes themselves; the heads are smaller (that&#x27;s a good thing), but the bristles seem to be firmer (not so sure about that), and that&#x27;s true of the more colorful compact heads, too.  </li>
      <li>It also leaves my teeth feeling fresh and clean after each brushing.</li>
      <li>Much better than the older models.</li>
      <li>But overall, good toothbrush, worth the money.   </li>
      <li>As you get older you realize how really important that is!</li>
      <li>After using the sonicare brush for a month, I&#x27;ve replaced it with the CVS sonic brush which to my opinion cleans better - bigger brush and better contact with teeth.</li>
      <li>LOVE the 2 minute timer, and I just can&#x27;t say enough that I LOVE how my teeth feel.</li>
      <li>I waited many months before purchasing this toothbrush, mainly because of the price.  </li>
      <li>My teeth feel as clean as they did right after my dental check-up.</li>
      <li>Had it for several months now and still very satisfied.</li>
      <li>The design is very well thought out, reasonably comfortable to use, and from my recent dentist vist -- results are good too.</li>
      <li>I guess I brush more than normal.</li>
      <li>Following the recommendation of friends, we bought our very first electric toothbrush and have been very satisfied with the quality of the brushing.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I am very pleased with the Oral B system and even my dentist thinks there is no difference in terms of effectiveness between both systems.  </li>
      <li>(She can handle the vibrations about 90% of the time, but the Sonicare is still much easier for her to use than a regular toothbrush--and definitely more effective.)    </li>
      <li>The new style, bent head and shaped brush, seems even better.  </li>
      <li>This new unit is even better than the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The new model is also lighter, looks sleeker, and has a rubber grip (I love the tactile feel of those).</li>
      <li>I have used a Sonicare for about 4 years and the new design is much better.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with my new sonicare and all the improvements since my older version.</li>
      <li>in all, the new model is more attractive, has a battery indicator, and the angled brush head is slightly easier to use.  </li>
      <li>All in all, the new model is more attractive, has a battery indicator, and the angled brush head is slightly easier to use.  </li>
      <li>The model is pricey, but works great and is easier to use than the previous heavier model.  </li>
      <li>The brush is easily cleaned, reaches the back of the mouth easily, and is comfortable to use.</li>
      <li>The shipping was fast and ordering was easy.  </li>
      <li>I have ended up taking apart the factory sealed part by bending the plastic tabs and giving the inner parts a good hot water bath and scrubbing with a q-tip.</li>
      <li>yes, the first one lasted 10 years!</li>
      <li>I bought the original Sonicare when it first came out -- 20 years ago?</li>
      <li>After a week or so, the brush&#x27;s strong massaging action began to feel really good, and I actually looked forward to brushing.</li>
      <li>As others have said, your teeth truely feel like you came from the dentist, and it is very gentle on your gums.  </li>
      <li>The light indicates how much battery life is remaining.  </li>
      <li>While its a great product, i had few issues with this brush:    </li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s a different kind of smile now.</li>
      <li>Take it from me, this brush is worth the money.    </li>
      <li>Please note that if you&#x27;re not used to using a powerful electric toothbrush, it will take you about 2 weeks to get fully used to this toothbrush.</li>
      <li>The e7300 has a battery charge indicator which is useful if you don&#x27;t leave the brush on the charger all the time.  </li>
      <li>I like the sonic action better than rotary or slower-speed mechanical motion.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for about 6 months now and it has made my teeth feel fresh and polished after every use.  </li>
      <li>Even though it&#x27;s pricey, the Sonicare Elite is easily worth it.  </li>
      <li>The hygenist who works with her instantly remarked at how much she loved her sonicare.  </li>
      <li>More frequently if you brush while in the shower.  </li>
      <li>and it is defintely better than my old one.  </li>
      <li>This is well worth the investment.  </li>
      <li>Sure enough, you can put the handle in any which way and the charging light comes on.</li>
      <li>But clearly they think they know what I need better than I do.    </li>
      <li>Take that for what it is worth...</li>
      <li>have a set that came with extra heads, a head storage stand, and a deluxe travel case.  </li>
      <li>I had pockets of some degree or another around 80% of my teeth; on the 2nd visit, this had been reduced to about 10%, it was that effective on my teeth AND gums.</li>
      <li>When I left the office, my dentist smiled at me and said, &amp;quot;Great job!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve covered it with clear tape and so far so good, but I have doubts about its longevity.</li>
      <li>It is worth the money so pull the trigger.</li>
      <li>What is worth noting is that, speaking for my self, my teeth have never been cleaner or healthier.</li>
      <li>and I am likely to continue using it until something better becomes available</li>
      <li>I know that these brushes are pricey, but they are worth it.</li>
      <li>The handle is a nice size, and not too big (diameter-wise).  </li>
      <li>Handy built in timer lets you know when to switch to the next quadrant of your mouth.  </li>
      <li>Both make me much more conscious of putting in the time to do a thorough job of brushing.  </li>
      <li>This is definitely a worth while investment.  </li>
      <li>Ease of use encourages more frequent brushing.  </li>
      <li>However, once you commit to the expense, it is well worth the money.</li>
      <li>I believe that it has increased my dental &amp; gum health, which is worth a lot to me.</li>
      <li>At a top of the line price, I expected more.  </li>
      <li>Back off on the pressure, it does not take much pressure to clean effectively with Sonicare.      </li>
      <li>My original one lasted over a year, but I used it very infrequently (never got hooked on it).</li>
      <li>to see what I was getting into, and you&#x27;ve got to do this just right or the tickling of your lips will be unbearable.</li>
      <li>right?</li>
      <li>I am well please with the electric brush and recieve it right away.         </li>
      <li>, I want to go brush my teeth right now.  </li>
      <li>It really did clean as advertised.</li>
      <li>The stains that were developing immediately began to disappear and my teeth looked much whiter and felt wonderfully clean in just a couple of weeks without any &amp;quot;extra whitening&amp;quot; toothpaste.</li>
      <li>It works just fine, and my toothbrush looks brand new.  </li>
      <li>We first bought this toothbrush through our dentist and it seemed worth the price tag.</li>
      <li>All of the Sonicare toothbrushes apparently have better batteries now.  </li>
      <li>Since they brag that the unit can be used for 2 weeks (twice a day) on a full charge, they are really asking me to stand there for an hour (2x2x14 minutes) and restart the unit 28 times.</li>
      <li>This was $15 cheaper than where I normally shop at the Army Air Force Ecxhange and shipping was free.  </li>
      <li>The first was my dentist had an operation and is out of the picture for a couple of months, right when its time to get a cleaning.</li>
      <li>The result is they really work better than manual (just my experimental observation)</li>
      <li>Since my dental health improved so much and so quickly, my husband also got one</li>
      <li>If you leave the toothbrush together during travel, the brush head may get bent resulting in the toothbrush making a very loud rattling sound when in use.</li>
      <li>so i cant fairly compare it to other models, but i will say that my teeth feel and look much cleaner than they did when i was brushing manaully.</li>
      <li>This new slightly angled brush head is great.</li>
      <li>My teeth feel so clean &amp;amp; my gums are getting more pink.</li>
      <li>/&gt;12 months later, I still marvel at how smooth and clean my teeth feel after each brushing.  </li>
      <li>My hygienist recommended the Philips Sonicare toothbrush to me a while back, and am I ever glad I listened to her.</li>
      <li>It does what it advertises, which is why I bought another after my first one ran out of battery.</li>
      <li>It cost too much like everything thats worth a damn.</li>
      <li>Needless to say, the recipient is VERY impressed with the way it cleans her teeth.</li>
      <li>but overall my mouth feels much better</li>
      <li>And I just had my first dentist appointment since using the Sonicare and cleaning my teeth was a breeze for the hygenist...</li>
      <li>The first time will be a shock and you&#x27;ll wonder how brushing your teeth with that toothbrush could ever be pleasurable.</li>
      <li>and it really cleans and whitens your teeth!</li>
      <li>This is my first electric toothbrush</li>
      <li>, all the sonicare models do an outstanding job of keeping teeth cleaned, if used properly.  </li>
      <li>As far as getting a good brushing it is fantastic but it has a design flaw that I would have thought they would have fixed long ago.</li>
      <li>First we purchased an e7300.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My first one lasted 7 years and then the battery gave out.</li>
      <li>I used the Sonicare Elite for several years, buying the hype that it was cleaning my teeth better than I could.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely leaves your mouth feeling fresh and massaged.</li>
      <li>Yes, it will tickle at first when you just start using it</li>
      <li>(forget the exact number) uses to allow you time to get accustomed to it.</li>
      <li>This product works exactly as my dentist said it would.  </li>
      <li>This is the first sonicare I have owned</li>
      <li>The Elite series has a smaller head and comes off of the body of the brush at a more ergonomically functional angle.  </li>
      <li>First of all, why are they shutting it off after 2 minutes?</li>
      <li>I am told to first deplete the battery.</li>
      <li>When my dentist sold me my first Sonicare, he told me that in his opinion using Sonicare is like having microsurgery for gum disease, without the trauma and</li>
      <li>though)-I believe the higher model allows you to customize the timer to allow for additional brush time.  </li>
      <li>This brush cleans very well!</li>
      <li>My dentist recommended the Sonicare toothbrush at my most recent visit.</li>
      <li>18 months later: The on-button has a flexible covering that has now perforated at the top, allowing moisture to get inside the barrel.  </li>
      <li>Higher on dollars --   e7300</li>
      <li>The first time I thought it was a fluke</li>
      <li>It was that much better and my teeth definitely has this sensation after I brush my teeth.</li>
      <li>Amazon had the best price by far and I compared prices with the local Military Exchange too.  </li>
      <li>I have to floss multiple times every day and water pick to keep my gums healthy.      </li>
      <li>This toothbrush was worth every penny and will save me much money (and pain)</li>
      <li>I think sonicare is better because of different motion than oral b.</li>
      <li>(i.e. top front, top back, bottom front, bottom back).</li>
      <li>Even after the first night of usage, I noticed a difference in the cleanliness of my teeth.    </li>
      <li>It was recommended by a dentist, and despite the expense, I am not sorry I splurged.</li>
      <li>Sounds funny but running the brush head through the dishwasher monthly seems to work.</li>
      <li>The vibrating stick seems better from a hygiene standpoint and creates a similar amount of vibration.    </li>
      <li>When we bought this model, we expected the same good performance we had from the original.  </li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t clean the underside of the head on older models, they get pretty gross very quickly.  </li>
      <li>I definatly get a better clean than with conventional brushes.  </li>
      <li>i bought this product since i constantly had gum problems (my gums used to bleed at times) and all the other reviews were right, it is a great product.</li>
      <li>One caution, though: As I recall, when I stopped brushing long ago and got 9 cavities, several were on the chewing surfaces, so best to hit those too.&lt;br /&gt;[Months later]</li>
      <li>The circular action doesn&#x27;t wear away the gum line, and my teeth are significantly cleaner.  </li>
      <li>I would be surprised if this unit lasts even a fraction of the 20 years of the original unit.</li>
      <li>I would also say that it is simply hard for me to believe any brush could work better or feel better than the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The thing I love most about my Sonicare is that I don&#x27;t have to brush hard.</li>
      <li>I have been using the Sonicare toothbrush for many years and am pleased with the results (though I recommend that you not press too hard as it may damage your enamel over time).</li>
      <li>The built-in timer is really nice, so that I know how much time I&#x27;ve spent on my mouth.</li>
      <li>my old model, I never removed the brush heads except to change them and perhaps once a month to clean the built-up toothpaste that accumulated around the collar that secured the head to the handle.  </li>
      <li>What most impresses me about the Sonicare, however, is how well thought out the design is (no doubt thanks to numerous preceeding trial and errors).</li>
      <li>I had always thought that it was just a gadget made for people who had too much money or who simply had to have the latest electronic gadgets.  </li>
      <li>can only appreciate how much cleaner your teeth are and how much better your gums feel by using this device.</li>
      <li>such, I am not going to spend a lot of time commenting on the effectiveness of the sonicare approach in general (which I think is excellent) or in comparing it to other brands.  </li>
      <li>(but without the sore gums).  Highly recommended and well worth the money, considering the benefits to oral health.</li>
      <li>is it worth the high price?</li>
      <li>He did compliment on the product and mention how most of his sonic toothbrush patients have comparably cleaner gum/teeth, but of course, that could just mean that people who use these ivory toothbrushs do care more about their oral hygiene than others.</li>
      <li>Based on positive reviews and a tempting Gold Box offer, I gave the Sonicare Elite a chance.</li>
      <li>The Oral B is well designed (with one minor annoyance) and it cleans better.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on the original (\\&quot;Advanced\\&quot;) model because this one is so much better.</li>
      <li>The brush head is smaller and more comfortable to use -- and it gets my teeth as white as they can be.  </li>
      <li>us, the purchase of this has paid off handsomely in the long run.</li>
      <li>We now emerge from dental appointments without a long list of cavities in need of fillings and there is no plaque on our teeth (most of the time).</li>
      <li>I thought that the bells and whistle timer functions would be a waist of time (pun not intended) but they really help to keep you aware of what you are doing and where you are doing it.  </li>
      <li>Also, toothpaste sticks to the rubber more readily than to the smooth plastic of the old model, making it slightly more difficult to keep clean.  </li>
      <li>Also, toothpaste sticks to the rubber more readily than to the smooth plastic of the old model, making it slightly more difficult to keep clean.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for a little over a month now and decided to see if the promise that it&#x27;s dishwasher safe was true.  </li>
      <li>The snap on style heads available on some Sonicare models remain securely attached to the base unit and therefore, transfer the ultrasonic vibrations to the brush head and your teeth more effectively.</li>
      <li>If you want a fantastic toothbrush that makes your mouth feel like you just had a professional cleaning - I highly reccommend this brush.</li>
      <li>If it were only that easy.    </li>
      <li>I can actually get to all of my teeth at all angles easily.</li>
      <li>My dentist recommended sonicare because I was not getting my gumline top and bottom clean enough, and cavities were starting to form.  </li>
      <li>For the slightly greater price I would recommend the model that has five 30-second cycles so that it is possible to clean the chewing surfaces of the back teeth without having to turn it on again.</li>
      <li>But the unit obviously isn&#x27;t designed for the user to easily do this.  </li>
      <li>-I always feel a surge of guilt when I turn it off prematurely, which may be a good thing because my teeth and gums (and wallet) will probably thank me in the long run for brushing properly.</li>
      <li>It certainly helps with plaque control.</li>
      <li>The improvement was pure Sonicare.</li>
      <li>Worth the update even if your old style is still working!</li>
      <li>Whereas the original has bristles that travel through a 90 degree arc, the Elite bristles barely travel at all.  </li>
      <li>This brushing action is fantastic, just like the new one, but this design stinks...literally.</li>
      <li>It greatly remove all dirty things in my mouth and easy to unse and brush.  </li>
      <li>Water can seep in and remain trapped more easily than on the old model which had no opening at that location.  </li>
      <li>I can barely feel the brush on my teeth, but my teeth feel really really clean afterwards.</li>
      <li>The last one still worked fine when I replaced it 5 years ago</li>
      <li>some genius figured, hey, just switch to a much higher vibration rate of the main mechanism, and that&#x27;s a beep.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I upgraded to this new one because it reaches the rear, hard-to-reach areas much easier than the last one, thanks to the slimmer head and angled brush.  </li>
      <li>Now you will have a nice little task of cleaning the mirror, the sink, your shirt, the wall, the floor...</li>
      <li>I visited my dentist after using this item twice a day for six months and, for the first time ever, received high praise for my admirable oral care.  </li>
      <li>I occasionally use my tooth whitener, but I use the Sonic Elite toothbrush twice a day and it truly makes a huge difference in the appearance of my teeth.</li>
      <li>Really, my dentist smiles when I go in.</li>
      <li>but this one really has improved his teeth.  </li>
      <li>What I really like it the battery charge level LEDs on the barrel.</li>
      <li>but it really seems to work.  </li>
      <li>A sanitizer won&#x27;t help, either, because the location where the mold is growing is not likely to be exposed to the UV light in the charger.  </li>
      <li>This was a lot of money, but I agreed that if I was going to spend $6000 on braces another $200 would be worth it if it meant the fixed teeth wouldn&#x27;t be cavity ridden when the braces came off.  </li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t give it much thought about replacing it.</li>
      <li>I was very amazed.  </li>
      <li>it really works to take off plaque.</li>
      <li>Well, there&#x27;s enough of a sounding board in it that the vibration makes sound waves, so</li>
      <li>Sonicare is so gentle on your gums and just glides over your teeth.  </li>
      <li>I really do like the thinner neck and would buy again.</li>
      <li>, this brush gently cleans the backs with minimum motion on your part.&lt;br</li>
      <li>once a week to keep my teeth stain free and white.</li>
      <li>and I feel it has been worth the money thus far.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>However, given how this brush really saves teeth and preserves their attractiveness, it is really a bargain.  </li>
      <li>My teeth are much whiter now too.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, and the word \\&quot;elegant\\&quot; actually comes to mind.  </li>
      <li>When you turn it on it vibrates (a lot) which created an intense tickling sensation on the inside of my cheeks and gums.</li>
      <li>It has really helped my gums (in addition to flossing) according to my dental hygienist.</li>
      <li>that the electronic scaler could not do the whole job anyway.</li>
      <li>one week, my teeth were much whiter.</li>
      <li>As time went by, my gums became pink and healthy looking.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Sonicare use has really improved my gums which had been bleeding and  receeding.</li>
      <li>I had 8 cavities filled, and a couple deep cleanings, and this toothbrush is what&#x27;s helping with the repair and maintenance of my teeth.</li>
      <li>This toothbrush really cleans my teeth well.  </li>
      <li>Just push the power button when you are ready to brush, put the brush against your teeth, move the brush around your mouth and let the brush do the rest of the work.</li>
      <li>(\\&quot;e seventy-three hundred\\&quot;) --   this very brush here.    </li>
      <li>The battery also lasts for a much longer time.    </li>
      <li>I found it very convenient.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I found it very convenient.  </li>
      <li>They said his teeth were in fantastic shape and they no longer had that yellow film.  </li>
      <li>I do not have to floss as much as I did before.  </li>
      <li>The 7300 has the feature of the quad interval timer, which is very helpful.  </li>
      <li>Feels like your teeth are much cleaner; faster to brush teeth</li>
      <li>It cleans very well.</li>
      <li>Only problem I&#x27;ve encountered is the sound of the toothbrush scares my dog.</li>
      <li>It really helped improve the health of my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This thing really works.</li>
      <li>(Do you think China would really do that?)    </li>
      <li>My dental hygienist can really tell the difference.</li>
      <li>and I know it will be much easier</li>
      <li>but otherwise, it is a very valuable toothbrush.</li>
      <li>Important to remember that even a Sonicare is not a substitute for flossing into the deep gaps between teeth.  </li>
      <li>It offers more features and it&#x27;s the same price,</li>
      <li>I laughed at the one negative review of the travel case-</li>
      <li>Two minutes is more than enough to complete a thorough brushing.  </li>
      <li>I had an older model sonicare that i thought was great for a long time in fact i still have it use it for travel, anyway i think the elite 7300 power toothbrush is a great product and does just what it says, and if lasts half as long as my other sonicare i will buy another sonicare product.</li>
      <li>There were several Sonicare brushes available when I went shopping, but I chose this one because it is more slim-line than some of the other models.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t attribute all of this to the Sonicare because I&#x27;m sure their treatment and my longer brushing sessions due to the Sonicare&#x27;s timer helped a lot too, but I&#x27;m confident that at least part of the improvement was due to the Sonicare&#x27;s superior cleaning.</li>
      <li>The original Sonicare and the current Advance models have a large head which extends straight from the main body of the toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>No matter what toothbrush or paste, including straight baking soda, I tried, they never felt clean enough.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you clean the head and the handle at least weekly.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t be giving you all any more updates, unless all of my teeth fall out due to the usage of this product.</li>
      <li>Other things I love about it is the fact that it indicates when it is time to switch quadrants.</li>
      <li>should disclose that as power toothbushes go, I have only ever used Sonicare, and started with the original design.</li>
      <li>There are, however, lots of other features which make this a better brush.  </li>
      <li>I feel that this product does a better job of cleaning and whitening my teeth than any other product I have used.  </li>
      <li>My original Sonicare just started acting up.</li>
      <li>is also angled to provide easier access to the back teeth and \\&quot;flexes\\&quot; both horizontally and vertically.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the Elite just does not seem as \\&quot;powerful\\&quot; as the original.  </li>
      <li>No need for whitening strips and other products if you&#x27;re using the Sonicare, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
      <li>The price of this, though   more reliable, cannot   beat the other&#x27;s cost.     </li>
      <li>These older models use NiCad so they really should be recycled.</li>
      <li>The small brushhead is great for getign around to your back teeth</li>
      <li>I got a pack of extra heads and my husband tried it and said his teeth felt as clean as leaving the dentist.  </li>
      <li>I have purchased a Braun Oral-B Triumph to replace it and it has been a much more economical alternative and functions just as well, if not better.</li>
      <li>So, if you are on a moderate budget for a squeaky clean teeth and don&#x27;t mind shelling out a couple of \\&quot;jacksons\\</li>
      <li>And sure enough, no matter how you put it in, even half falling out, the charging light lights up.</li>
      <li>Does a terrific job of leaving teeth feeling clean.</li>
      <li>After that visit, I did a little more research into the Sonicare and based on all of the positive reviews from both dentists and patients, I decided to go ahead and buy one.  </li>
      <li>I have used the older model Sonicare for quite wome time;it was good but bulky and heavy, so I expected more of the same with the Sonicare Elite.  </li>
      <li>The first time I used my old Sonicare</li>
      <li>After the first time using it, it felt like I just had my teeth professionally cleaned.  </li>
      <li>and you have to buy a whole new toothbrush.</li>
      <li>The head has what appear to be magnets at the end of some good-sized struts, and apparently the electronics generate an oscillating magnetic field right through the plastic to shake them.</li>
      <li>Sonicare cleans better than manual brushing... and requires less wrist/hand movement.</li>
      <li>Try to protect the button with particular care.</li>
      <li>You get the collers that screw on the main unit, not just the toothbrush head.  </li>
      <li>While I&#x27;m writing to review the 7300, mine was a much older version.  </li>
      <li>Still have the older version.  </li>
      <li>But, of course, the main reason to get the Elite is because it will make your teeth cleaner and healthier than they&#x27;ve ever been before.</li>
      <li>I had one of the older Sonicare models before the Elite came out.  </li>
      <li>I have the older model of the Sonicare Elite e series.</li>
      <li>After being examined by her the first time in June, I went back after having used the Sonicare consistently in September.</li>
      <li>This is the classic razor/razorblade product approach.</li>
      <li>I had an older model of the Sonicare and decided to upgrade  to this model.  </li>
      <li>this particular model:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am so glad that I got this specific toothbrush because no regular toothbrush gives me the cleanliness feeling that my Sonicare toothbrush gives me after brushing.</li>
      <li>It is a replacement for an older model that has worn out.  </li>
      <li>After 6+ years the white had discolored to an unattractive dull yellow, but it had the important advantage of being able to keep clean.  </li>
      <li>would highly recommend this toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>The hygenist gave me a high score on my dental hygiene.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>but I figured that if it was so highly recommended I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>highly recommend this unit to anyone with recurring periodontal issues.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>While this brush may seem expensive, factor in 14 years of use and the cleanest teeth ever, and it really becomes a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to start shopping for a new one.</li>
      <li>My teeth feel really clean after each use (as compared to a manual brush) and it stays charged for a long time.</li>
      <li>I knew an electric toothbrush would make a significant difference my dental health, but my teeth look and feel much cleaner than I expected.    </li>
      <li>Only an independent lab would know, but by my experience of 4yrs with the original Sonicare has done wonders for my teeth!</li>
      <li>I first bought an a4100 which lacked a major feature; then I got this one.  </li>
      <li>A single charge lasts many sessions and the unit simply drops into its charger as simple and sweet as you&#x27;d ever want.</li>
      <li>I bought my first and only Sonicare model after very high recommendations by my periodontist.</li>
      <li>* battery indicator - shows when charging (which old one had) and shows how much charge remains</li>
      <li>The only complaint I have is that when you replace the toothbrush in the charger, it must be seated precisely to charge, otherwise it keeps blinking causing you to return to make sure it&#x27;s seated correctly.  </li>
      <li>Not a big deal, but worth noting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not a big deal, but worth noting.    </li>
      <li>Pluses: Way powerful brush initially.</li>
      <li>Personally, I don&#x27;t think the LEDs are worth it.  </li>
      <li>After a few days with the Oral B, it has lost most of the yellowing.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t find it particularly necessary or useful.  </li>
      <li>Now she even takes it with her on business trips rather than a normal toothbrush.    </li>
      <li>/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s simply no complaint about the toothbrush at all except maybe the cost.</li>
      <li>Battery lasts about 8 days in normal use (2 times a day).</li>
      <li>Does a good job brushing, but will send you to the poor house.</li>
      <li>new design looks attractive now, with its accenting blue rubber sides; however, that rubber is very likely going to fade and discolor relatively quickly, unlike the previous model which took a very long time before it started to look shabby.  </li>
      <li>The new design looks attractive now, with its accenting blue rubber sides; however, that rubber is very likely going to fade and discolor relatively quickly, unlike the previous model which took a very long time before it started to look shabby.  </li>
      <li>I was lucky enough to get one (the e7300 model), for about $80 from Amazon back when it was being first introduced in 2008.</li>
      <li>Anyway, charging is apparently also by transformer action right through the plastic.</li>
      <li>It works even better than the old one and cost a bit less.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s right next to your head.    </li>
      <li>I had the original type for about 6 years - maybe it had gotten weak or maybe there is a difference, but this new one is really strong.  </li>
      <li>I had my first one for 3 years before I felt it was to gross and bought a new one, but it still worked!  </li>
      <li>, the Sonicare is a little pricey and the &amp;quot;sonic action&amp;quot; takes some getting used to, but the pay off of healthy teeth and gums far outweighs those considerations.</li>
      <li>I live in Nevada.  </li>
      <li>Admittedly, the new sides make it easier to grip.  </li>
      <li>My daughter loves her new Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>The new FlexCare model solves this.    </li>
      <li>When I&#x27;m finished brushing, my teeth feel brand new...</li>
      <li>I like the thinner toothbrush and the 30-second timer in this new model.  </li>
      <li>We can&#x27;t live without our electric toothbrush and would urge everyone to buy this brand.</li>
      <li>It has been about a month now with the new electric toothbrush</li>
      <li>The new design eliminates all that slew of slime.</li>
      <li>I just received this new model.</li>
      <li>The new one exceeded my expectations.  </li>
      <li>We upgraded to the new FLEXCARE</li>
      <li>and I now have a brand new toothbrush.</li>
      <li>this is my handle&#x27;s Swan Song, I won&#x27;t think twice before paying over $100 for a new one.</li>
      <li>I am also considering this new toothbrush that claims to emit ultrasonic waves while brushing, which was featured on the Pop Sci magazine...</li>
      <li>After I got my new toothbrush, my mom expressed to me the importance of taking care of it because it was pricey for \\&quot;just a toothbrush.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I have had this model over 2 years and it still works like new.</li>
      <li>I had a problem with over-brushing before but now with this new Sonicare</li>
      <li>but I wanted to upgrade to the new Activator.  </li>
      <li>my mouth feels super clean after brushing and my gums have hardly ever bled since i started using this.</li>
      <li>they could definitely tell the difference between my using a Sonicare vs. a regular brush (or a cheap electronic toothbrush knockoff).    </li>
      <li>Our whole family used the same toothbrush, thanks to the interchangeable heads.</li>
      <li>My old Sonicare Essence lasted quite a few years without any glitch until the batteries would not hold charge any more.</li>
      <li>I was skeptical at first, but after using it for one month I am very glad that I purchased it.  </li>
      <li>The brushing action of the Elite series is an improvement over the older models.</li>
      <li>still don&#x27;t floss as I should, but my gums are pink, now and the pockets aren&#x27;t as deep and most have disappeared.  </li>
      <li>I only wish it was available when I was younger.</li>
      <li>but I see no good cleaning methods suggested, and the Sonicare website makes it sound like it&#x27;s a breeze to clean once a week: \\&quot;Wipe away any residue you find, including the area covered by the cuff, with a soft cloth or paper towel.</li>
      <li>It was a little more than I wanted to spend on a toohbrush, but with the gums my mother gave me, I know its a worthy investment and will likely decrease my future dentist bills.</li>
      <li>After my first generation Sonicare unit stopped working, I decided to go back to a manual toothbrush, since I didn&#x27;t want the expense of a new Sonicare.</li>
      <li>She had a different model by a different manufacturer and this one definitely works much better.</li>
      <li>After I started using the Sonicare, every time I went to the dental hygienist or ortho assistant (and these people were in different offices &amp; rotated, so the original recommending dentist was not getting a kick back)</li>
      <li>Even if you prevent only one cavity (which going by my family&#x27;s history, it absolutely does), the Sonicare will pay for itself!</li>
      <li>WOW!  </li>
      <li>But no, the continued whiteness is just from regularly using the Sonicare Elite toothbrush (with Crest&#x27;s Rejeuvenating Effects toothpaste, if anyone is interested).   </li>
      <li>The brush head is much smaller than the old dynosaur I had, and it doesn&#x27;t buzz as much, and doesn&#x27;t spray toothpaste around much at all.  </li>
      <li>I bought this model as an upgrade to my old Sonicare (which gave me about 8 years of use!).  </li>
      <li>It is angled and that makes it easier to use, so you&#x27;re able to get into areas you usually cannot.  </li>
      <li>had my first post-Sonicare cleaning just last week.</li>
      <li>It was answered by someone speaking perfect American English who, patiently, helped me recognize the &#x27;tones&#x27; the toothbrush was producing every 30 seconds - silly me, I was expecting to hear some &#x27;beep&#x27; while the toothbrush signals the 30-second via a change in the vibration pitch.is included.</li>
      <li>It was answered by someone speaking perfect American English who, patiently, helped me recognize the &#x27;tones&#x27; the toothbrush was producing every 30 seconds - silly me, I was expecting to hear some &#x27;beep&#x27; while the toothbrush signals the 30-second via a change in the vibration pitch.</li>
      <li>I already have one and feel like it cleans my teeth better than an ordinary toothbrush.</li>
      <li>This was my first electric toothbrush and after only two weeks of using it coffee stains are gone and my teeth are getting whiter every day.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it in the long run.</li>
      <li>The Elite e7300 is my second Sonicare toothbrush (6 1/2 years until the first couldn&#x27;t be recharged).  </li>
      <li>It will tickle your nose a bit at first, but you definitely get used to it, as you get used to the extreme clean it provides.</li>
      <li>I had an old Sonicare for almost 5 years and the battery ... out on me, so I decided to get a new one.  </li>
      <li>My old one sprang to life when I purchased the new one.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m curious to see how long this unit lasts, because it seems that many people complain of Sonicares dying after a year.  </li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m not real keen about having black mold 3 inches from my mouth, even if it is trapped inside the \\&quot;guts\\&quot; of the brush head and not on the brushes/stem itself.dull yellow, but it had the important advantage of being able to keep clean.  </li>
      <li>With the new one is so much easier to reach the back teeth.</li>
      <li>However, I have a sneaking suspicion the rubber is going to fade and look old more quickly than my older model which was entirely white plastic except for a single small on/off</li>
      <li>flossing is easier since using this tooth brush cleans better than the manual ones ( gross I know but much less gunk )</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d like to have my original teeth as long as possible.</li>
      <li>The gap isn&#x27;t large, but is visible to the naked eye.  </li>
      <li>The gap isn&#x27;t large, but is visible to the naked eye.  </li>
      <li>It certainly was in the last razor I purchased.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t they have engineers smart enough to figure that out?</li>
      <li>Buy this or try two of those;   Less than three duds wins!</li>
      <li>The technology clearly works.</li>
      <li>This is a clear case of terminal helpfulness.     </li>
      <li>This way I always know how much charge I have left and don&#x27;t have to keep it on the charger all of the time.</li>
      <li>Your teeth really do feel like you just left the dentist.  </li>
      <li>Given the need to conserve resources and the considerable expense of the brush</li>
      <li>The thirty second timer is a really helpful tool.     </li>
      <li>(which old one did not have)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>On my old model, I never had a mold problem - ever.  </li>
      <li>However, I don&#x27;t ever recall dropping my old handle because it was overly slippery and</li>
      <li>Now the crack has almost made a complete circle around the button.</li>
      <li>Today it just died completely and it has not even been two years yet.</li>
      <li>It is for real and uses the same heads as the Elite.  </li>
      <li>The action is identical.  </li>
      <li>Wish we had had this in the early 60&#x27;s when I was growing up.</li>
      <li>I got a killer deal (50 percent off regular price), so that really influenced my decision.  </li>
      <li>However, I also have sensitive gums and my dentist had been recommending one of these for a while.  </li>
      <li>Not too far off the mark,</li>
      <li>I was surprised that the Sonicare Elite&#x27;s reading was OFF THE CHART, producing over 200 milligauss.  </li>
      <li>I really like the smaller handle with the rubber sides.  </li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;m getting the hang of it, and I rather like the brushing action.</li>
      <li>I really think it will save money on dental work in the future.</li>
      <li>So far she has not been concerned.  </li>
      <li>Our old one \\&quot;died\\&quot; and we had to order another one in a hurry.  </li>
      <li>and I admit that I prefer it quite a bit to the old manual one.  </li>
      <li>The battery did not die on me, but the rubber button that covers the power switch developed a tear and thus allowing water into the chamber where the electronics reside.</li>
      <li>recently my old model died, refusing to take a charge after about 13 years.  </li>
      <li>old Sonicare did not have the Quad Pacer feature which this does</li>
      <li>If you are looking to replace your old one or want to get an powered toothbrush I would recommend.</li>
      <li>nice feature is that it is less messy than my older model.  </li>
      <li>I agree completely.  </li>
      <li>I really appreciate the 30 second beeps, so I know to change quadrants.  </li>
      <li>I used to toss my old one in my dopp kit, which is probably why it broke</li>
      <li>I have since junked this thing and bought an Oral B Sonic Complete.</li>
      <li>Oral B S-320 Sonic Complete Rechargeable Power Toothbrush]])</li>
      <li>While the \\&quot;original\\&quot; brush head will not fit the Elite handle, the Elite brush head WILL fit the \\&quot;original\\&quot; handle.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t reached for \\&quot;old</li>
      <li>Granted, I hadn&#x27;t had a professional cleaning in over 2 years.</li>
      <li>I have no complaints thus far.</li>
      <li>I was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>But the old one kept me out of the perio&#x27;s chair, and this one will too, and that&#x27;s what counts.    </li>
      <li>but I guess applying common sense makes more sense here.</li>
      <li>It is an addition to the old one</li>
      <li>I have used a Sonicare toothbrush for about five years, and the old one was beginning to wear out.</li>
      <li>The 2 minute cycle is marked by &#x27;tones&#x27; every 30 seconds</li>
      <li>My one call to customer service went very well, back in 2005.</li>
      <li>+ My one call to customer service went very well, back in 2005.</li>
      <li>Well basicly and um scientificly it spins realy fast so it polishes your teeth and gets all the junk out of the crevices.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think the Quadpacer would be a big deal, but I really like this feature.  </li>
      <li>No need to scrub your gums till they bleed, just guide the brush over your teeth and let the patented sonic action take care of the rest.  </li>
      <li>I went to the dentist in early June.  </li>
      <li>I replaced my old Sonicare with this one</li>
      <li>With regular toothbrushes, I would apply too much force that all my bristles would bend outwards.</li>
      <li>, my teeth felt much cleaner then when using a regular brush.</li>
      <li>If your parents have dentures and they aren&#x27;t particularly old, take heed...and get thee to a store NOW and purchase this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You can really see the difference, If you smoke the yellow starts to fade away.</li>
      <li>The brush provides a professional cleaning every time you brush.</li>
      <li>The Oral B S-320 Sonic Complete is lighter than the Sonicare Elite.  </li>
      <li>3 replacement heads for Oral B Sonic Complete are $18 on Amazon; 2 brush heads for the Sonicare system are between $23 and $28 on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Since using the Sonicare daily, I do not have as much build up</li>
      <li>I use the Elite model for travel, but still use my Advance model for everyday cleaning and actually like it better</li>
      <li>It is small, holds a charge for a long time and cleans your teeth and gums effectively.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one of the few things I&#x27;ve purchased that I really think is worth the money.</li>
      <li>Weird is good.</li>
      <li>In order to minimize this, I take the head off after each use, shake the water out of the well, and allow the unit to air-out while it sits in the charger base-but the smell still happens, albeit more slowly.</li>
      <li>a product as expensive as this, stay away unless replacing it every 15 months is within your plan as it does do a good job cleaning your teeth.</li>
      <li>They stay clean much longer and my gums are no longer getting scrubbed too hard.  </li>
      <li>My old regular toothbrush did not clean my teeth half as good.</li>
      <li>had the original Sonicare a few years ago, but it died on me.</li>
      <li>I imagine the 7500 will give you similar results to the 7300, so it just comes down to deciding whether or not to spend the extra bucks for some cute lights.  </li>
      <li>It seemed like a decent electric toothbrush except that crud would collect in the handle- gross.  </li>
      <li>Her first concern was that the brush was smaller than her prior model.  </li>
      <li>but the brush actually ramps itself up over the first ten or so</li>
      <li>It does a much better job at getting into small spaces and cleaning back teeth.</li>
      <li>If you have an older model, definitely consider upgrading to the Elite.  </li>
      <li>next 3-month checkup after starting to use my Sonicare was the first one in my life where I had no cavities, no work to be done, and no bleeding gums.  </li>
      <li>this is my second one I purchased, had the older model for 4 years.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use, travels well in the little case, and can hold a charge for several days if you are away from your charger.  </li>
      <li>Also, it is a little pricey, but doing a little bit comparison shopping to find a better price really pays off.  </li>
      <li>was hoping the Elite series  would have improved on the older Advance series design that was hard to keep clean but not so.</li>
      <li>in all, I highly recommend the Sonicare, especially for people with dental problems.</li>
      <li>It is not a normal size,but i&#x27;m sure it can be replaced with a little bit of research.  </li>
      <li>* charger - the new charger has open sides, unlike the old model which was a sealed \\&quot;well\\&quot; that would trap water and give rise to gunk build up.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d to seal the cleft on the button with tape, but no way to get back to normal function.</li>
      <li>The brush head is small enough that I can get a very thorough brushing without causing harm to my gums, and the quadpacer feature is a helpful reminder to brush for 2 full minutes.</li>
      <li>Hopefully, our next trip to the dentist will show that this toothbrush is as we both believe removing more plague than the oral-b. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While the toothbrush is more expensive than the oral-B, the refills are not far from the same.  </li>
      <li>The carry case will outlast the toothbrush if they only last a few years like many people are saying.</li>
      <li>The tickle factor was only the first couple of uses and then it moved past that - but try to avoid hitting your teeth with the plastic part because you&#x27;ll feel the vibrations right through your skull.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be going back to a new Braun.</li>
      <li>The new plastic travel case is obviously cheaper to make and a money saver for Philips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The new 7300 features a brush head that is like a regular toothbrush in size and shape.</li>
      <li>and they send me a brand new Sonic (different model) within 4 days.  </li>
      <li>I can say that now I feel less self-conscious when I smile.  </li>
      <li>It is so much easier brushing your teeth with Sonicare then with a regular manual toothbrush, we will never go back to manual brush.</li>
      <li>My ten year old daughter who hates going to the dentist loves to use it!</li>
      <li>I do feel like my teeth are cleaned better used this toothbrush than anything I&#x27;ve every tried outside a dentist&#x27;s cleaning, but it&#x27;s a pretty expensive option for a toothbrush.</li>
      <li>My dentist has said that it has made a major difference in the amount of plaque, etc.</li>
      <li>/&gt;For what you pay for the unit this is a major design flaw IMO.</li>
      <li>Little pricey but worth the money</li>
      <li>It finally pooped out after many years of use and several hard falls onto my ceramic tile bathroom floor.</li>
      <li>In fact I never would have thought of upgrading except for the fact that I was doing lots of traveling and the older models didn&#x27;t keep their charge very long.   </li>
      <li>I would recommend the Oral-B Sonic complete toothbrush which cleans as well as Sonicare, has a better brush (larger, smother), is easier to clean, and is less expensive.</li>
      <li>but i am not sure whether it really whitens the teeth, i don&#x27;t notice much of a difference there.  </li>
      <li>barely any plaque to scrape off at all.</li>
      <li>* Handle - my old handle was constructed entirely of plastic, with no rubberized sides.  </li>
      <li>Thats because of the fact that I charged and drained the battery completely on the initial charge and continued to do so</li>
      <li>I recently had a professional teeth cleaning.  </li>
      <li>When I realized it had been nearly 16 months, I finally screwed up the courage to go.</li>
      <li>I find the 7300 far easier to maneuver, but that&#x27;s just my personal experience.</li>
      <li>you frequently travel internationally, like me, you should note that the unit holds its charge for up to 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>Three months was too much --   for the cheaper brush was crushed.   </li>
      <li>but when i decided to give this a try, it changed the way i looked at my cross action toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Sonicare brushes for, apparently, 7-8 years</li>
      <li>My husband has sensitive gums therefore, it is a struggle for my him to brush and floss regularly.  </li>
      <li>But, its only been a week so far</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a geek... and often find myself in love with the newest toy or gadget just to have my heart broken when it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
      <li>The dental tech recommended this unit, and after using it for a few months, I returned to the Dentist and was given a very positive diagnosis.  </li>
      <li>The hygienist had to scale (and scale, and scale) by hand - because my teeth and gums were very sensitive, and because I had such deep &amp;quot;pockets&amp;quot; (yes, gum disease!)</li>
      <li>Gives you the clean feeling a regular toothbrush doesn&#x27;t usually give you.  </li>
      <li>: you have to keep the threads clean as water gets in and causes the gunk; brush seems kinda small would prefer a larger brush; the settings and timings are too gimicky for me</li>
      <li>The toothbrush vibrated very weakly yet made a very noisy rattling sound.  </li>
      <li>In my opinion, the new model is a poor design and the company is going to have a significant problem until they redesign the brush heads and eliminate this rubber seal entirely, reverting back to a completely encapsulated design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s been absolutely no mechanical problems with any part of it, or any \\&quot;cosmetic\\&quot; flaws, after 4 months of use, still looks brand new!</li>
      <li>The standard brush head on the 4700 was a little big to easily reach my back teeth (but I have a pretty small mouth.)</li>
      <li>The thing I don&#x27;t like about both sonicare and CVS brushes is that they don&#x27;t use regular rechargable batteries so when their battery dies in a few years you will have to throw away the whole unit and get a new one.</li>
      <li>(I don&#x27;t disagree at all) but seem to overlook the poor design of the brushhead that allows gunk to build up quickly - even with a reasonably thorough \\&quot;cleaning\\&quot; following Sonicare&#x27;s recommendations.</li>
      <li>I am petite, and found that some of the other models to be too big and less comfortable to hold.    </li>
      <li>When it wears out apparently your only option is to discard the unit.  </li>
      <li>br /&gt;We have used the oral-B toothbrush for several years, however, my teeth have not ever felt as clean before and I am somewhat of a fanatic when it comes to brushing.  </li>
      <li>And remember to clean the whole unit at least once a week, as water &amp; toothpaste can seep down into the inner workings.</li>
      <li>I thought those simple little rotary toothbrushes were pretty nifty when they came out</li>
      <li>I had this product for the pass 2.5 years and guess what, the brush is very weak compare the how it was originally since the battery is older.</li>
      <li>First impressions are that Philips went for glitz over quality and has added all kinds of marginally useful or even useless \\&quot;features\\</li>
      <li>I replaced it only because the non-user-replaceable battery finally gave up the ghost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general</li>
      <li>On a subsequent visit to my dentist for a cleaning, I was in so much pain when the hygenist was scraping the plaque and tartar off of my teeth, that I had tears rolling down my face, and she offered me novacane.  </li>
      <li>My husband went on a business trip for a week and took a regular toothbrush, thinking it wouldn&#x27;t be that much of a difference (remember he&#x27;s had the Sonicare less than a month).  </li>
      <li>&quot;  I think the new Extreme should work well with rechargable AA.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m gotten better though, so there&#x27;s usually just a little foam dribble now!</li>
      <li>The only thing that I dislike about my Sonicare Elite 7300 is that water gets collected on the inside part of the handle and if you don&#x27;t detach your brush and dry it out or clean it out, it could start to smell or get hard water stains.</li>

<li> It did a good job, but the sonicare is in a league of</li>
<li> suppose these are good toothbrushes.  </li>
<li> This is a good investment.</li>
<li> And it is surprisingly</li>
<li> I have always loved to brush my teeth.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s good to know that you have the option.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
<li> Sounded good to me</li>
<li> Well both are good brushes than manual brushing.</li>
<li> I look forward to brushing my teeth and am amazed at how good my mouth feels after using the brush each morning.</li>
<li> and you&#x27;re good for a month&#x27;s vacation.</li>
<li> You&#x27;d be wise to purchase one if your kids are rather lax in their care, eat candy (even if they have to sneak to the neighbors&#x27; house to get it) and need to be watched like a hawk to get them to brush</li>
<li> If so, this is a wise investment.</li>
<li> But then again, clean teeth are priceless.    </li>
<li> Teeth feel a great deal cleaner and it charges and cleans up very easily.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m an engineer, and this may be the most beautiful machine I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
<li> It does an exceptional job of cleaning the backs of the teeth and well as the front surfaces.  </li>
<li> I bought my Sonicare Elite a couple of months ago &amp;amp; am very satisfied with the results.</li>
<li> and I am very pleased.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m very glad I bought it.</li>
<li> Even with all these shortcomings, elite 7300 is a great dental hygiene product that was way better than manual brushing.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s so great to be able to read reviews.</li>
<li> Very pleased with that.  </li>
<li> This product is highly effective at cleaning and maintaining a happy healthy smile.&lt;br</li>
<li> If there is a better brush buy it, but my experience shows the original Sonicare works great!</li>
<li> I love this toothbrush!</li>
<li> The difference in the two exam&#x27;s results was phenomenal!</li>
<li> she couldn&#x27;t find any more to scale, and she was so amazed she brought in the dentist! &lt;</li>
<li> I love it!</li>
<li> I love it!</li>
<li> I LOVE it!  </li>
<li> LOVE IT!</li>
<li> Love it!  </li>
<li> I have to agree that it does an amazing job.  </li>
<li> Also, if you&#x27;re the type of person that likes to see your teeth while you&#x27;re brushing, the vibration force of the brush will cause you to get speckles of toothpaste to fly on your mirror, which is a huge pet-peeve of my moms.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s kind of tingly, but you do get used to it.</li>
<li> Kind of like when the dentist cleans your teeth.     </li>
<li> The 2 speed settings are nice, but I&#x27;ll never use them.    </li>
<li> The timer that tells you to change sections of your mouth is nice too.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s own.      </li>
<li> I can honestly say that in 6+ years, there was never a hint of a mold problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I have had my braces off for more than a year (no post-braces cavities), and the dental hygienists still remark on what good health my teeth are in because of the Sonicare toothbrush I use.    </li>
<li> I really liked the QuadPacer feature and basically went looking for the cheapest model that had the QP.</li>
<li> So I bought the e7300 (after much searching, Amazon had the best price).</li>
<li> That&#x27;s kindof nice for hygenical purposes though.</li>
<li> Amazon was as fast an efficent as always and their price was the best.</li>
<li> but I will say, with no reservations, that this is the absolute best toothbrush I have ever used.</li>
<li> We now own 3 of these toothbrushes.  </li>
<li> What kind of engineering is this?</li>
<li> Theunit has a pacer that makes sure you spend 30 seconds on each of the 4 sections of your mouth, which is good because it forces you to brush correctly.</li>
<li> The case is a nice touch for traveling-</li>
<li> I liked the way it cleaned</li>
<li> The angled head is great, and does a wonderful job cleaning your back teeth.  </li>
<li> Nice people, but no offer to replace the unit.  </li>
<li> I tried to follow the instructions to replace the battery on my own</li>
<li> If you don&#x27;t own one of these, you should.  </li>
<li> Clean teeth feels great.    </li>
<li> You know the one, you put in a couple of AA batteries and it supposedly gives you a great clean.  </li>
<li> Truthfully, this is a marvelous instrument for getting and maintaining healthy teeth and most importantly gums.</li>
<li> then this is a good toothbrush and will keep your chompers squeaky clean!</li>
<li> While it&#x27;s true, it does a great job of cleaning teeth</li>
<li> it&#x27;s also very easy to take apart for road trips.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very easy to use -</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had a Sonicare toothbrush of one kind or another for many years.</li>
<li> This one is the best so far.</li>
<li> So now we bought the 7300 series and my husband  told  me he liked it better then the 5500 series.  </li>
<li> She waltzes in and out of the dentist now with virtually no plaque, no sign of gum disease and a great smile.  </li>
<li> I love that it runs on a segmented timer to keep me honest about the time I spend brushing.    </li>
<li> I had expressed to my parents that I wanted a good electric toothbrush because I feel that taking care of my teeth is extremely important.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if the Oral B product is designed more effectively</li>
<li> I bought an inexpensive electric toothbrush first just to see if I liked the idea compared with hand brushing, and was quite happy with it.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the toothbrush, its easy to use</li>
<li> We owned the original Sonicare for years and we loved it.  </li>
<li> if you have a great set of teeth and never had problems using regular toothbrushes, you might not find great value in this.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t delude yourself - sonic brushes can&#x27;t clean between the teeth despite the fantastic marketing claims about the &#x27;ultrasonic technology&#x27; lol.</li>
<li> My husband also found that it worked for him too - it&#x27;s very light and the handle is well shaped for him to hold.  </li>
<li> Now, my last 3 checkups have been flawless.</li>
<li> You should be able to replace the rechargeable battery.    </li>
<li> It is much better.</li>
<li> I have noticed my boyfriend&#x27;s teeth look much better as well.  </li>
<li> He also seems to brush his teeth more with this one.</li>
<li> That means it&#x27;s in the top tier of Sonicare products.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s a better unit.</li>
<li> I LOVE the way my teeth feel after using this toothbrush.</li>
<li> The instructions describe how to remove the battery so that it may be safely recycled, but that&#x27;s all.  </li>
<li> Many people have to use humidifiers (I don&#x27;t use one) to keep the house</li>
<li> After all, I think most people are like me and want to focus on maintaining their TEETH - not their toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> After all, I think most people are like me and want to focus on maintaining their TEETH - not their toothbrush.    </li>
<li> I have used this product before and have had fantastic results with it!</li>
<li> Upon my dentist&#x27;s recommendation, I bought a Sonicare toothbrush when I got braces more than 3 years ago.  </li>
<li> I love the way it cleans my teeth</li>
<li> one year after my purchase, the top button made of rub wore away.</li>
<li> I never thought I&#x27;d be so verbose over a toothbrush, but these are phenomenal.  </li>
<li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
<li> I love this tootbrush.  </li>
<li> Need I say more?</li>
<li> Make sure to use the travel case it comes with if you plan to take it on overnight trips.</li>
<li> It does a better job with brushing than a manual toothbrush.</li>
<li> Stays charged for weeks and brushes so much better that the Crest battery brush</li>
<li> Love both of the Sonicares.  </li>
<li> , it&#x27;s a lot more bang for your buck.</li>
<li> Love this product, I am so glad that I listened to my dentist and ordered this product.</li>
<li> Philips Sonicare Elite has been my favorite power toothbrush for over 10 years now.  </li>
<li> I LOVE this tooth brush.</li>
<li> but this feature also keeps me more mindful of HOW I&#x27;m brushing my teeth.</li>
<li> mind you... :)  </li>
<li> I purchased this Model after reading reviews about the various models and have been very happy with the purchase.  </li>
<li> I LOVE this toothbrush.</li>
<li> My gums feel better and the massage you can give them with this toothbrush is quite a treat.  </li>
<li> I love my Sonicare e7300.  </li>
<li> It really does a great job cleaning and without damaging my gums.</li>
<li> Manual brushing can&#x27;t achieve so many strokes/minute like the sonic type brushes.</li>
<li> You will need flosing, interdental brushes or better water jet for that.</li>
<li> and I think it does a better job cleaning my teeth than the Oral-B I used before buying this product.</li>
<li> B0013TVEWA Philips Sonicare Flexcare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush]] series seems to solve most of the issues that I faced with the elite series.</li>
<li> I have been a Sonicare fan for many years.</li>
<li> /&gt;Since I have no experience with others, I cannot tell you unequivocally that Sonicare&#x27;s better than its competitors.  </li>
<li> I am really glad I made the change.  </li>
<li> I have taken my Elite for trips in excess of two weeks, using it twice most days.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried the battery operated brushes, which are just OK.  </li>
<li> Buy one for everyone you love.  </li>
<li> Sonicare claims that the Elite is actually better from a functional point of view and I cannot say otherwise, so I will give them the benefit of the doubt.  </li>
<li> have found one interesting thing...</li>
<li> But, then I lost dental insurance, and wanted to be able to keep my teeth cleaner between visits, so started shopping Amazon again.  </li>
<li> so I can make sure I&#x27;m getting all the areas and am angling the brush correctly (they recommend keeping it at around a 30 degree angle to your tooth surface), so in the beginning I would drool toothpaste foam each time.</li>
<li> Over all, though, its a top notch product.</li>
<li> faster brush; lighter handle; and tapered to reach backsides of teeth much better.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m very happy with this toothbrush and it truly makes a difference when used daily.</li>
<li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
<li> So much better than the model before it.</li>
<li> I bought an Elite 7500 model because that&#x27;s what the store had, but I don&#x27;t think there were many differences in the 7300 and the 7500.</li>
<li> I wish I&#x27;d had this toothbrush a year or more ago.</li>
<li> I love the \\&quot;massage\\&quot; feeling while I&#x27;m brushing too.</li>
<li> Now I&#x27;m sure that every part of my mouth is getting the attention it deserves.</li>
<li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
<li> Too many reviews;   </li>
<li> THIS costs three times more than THAT.   </li>
<li> I am completely satisfied.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
<li> My wife, for example, can&#x27;t stand the vibrating brush while I love it</li>
<li> but I doubt that &#x27;something better&#x27; exists today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I&#x27;d like it better with plastic all-over.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
<li> I find that I brush better with it, targeting spots that I hadn&#x27;t before with a manual toothbrush.</li>
<li> and he needed to brush more</li>
<li> After 3 months he went back to the dentist and they gave him an excellent report.</li>
<li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
<li> My wife and I both love them and I use one just for my business travel</li>
<li> We both love this toothbrush.  </li>
<li> and i found this one to be much better.</li>
<li> With this toothbrush, he is able to get all the plague from around his gumline so that his teeth do not bleed anymore when brushing or flossing.   </li>
<li> How many electric products can you use twice-a-day for 3 1/2 years without replacing them?  </li>
<li> br /&gt;We are so satisfied with this product that we don&#x27;t flinch at the price of the replacement heads.  </li>
<li> The Sonicare design provides much more power and durability.  </li>
<li> whatever it is called) is a must and makes brushing your teeth much more</li>
<li> Just make sure it&#x27;s topped off</li>
<li> My cousin Jenny, who is in her second year in dental school, said that buying a Sonicare toothbrush was the best thing you could do for your teeth as recommended by her professors and colleagues, so my mom thought that I might as well try it and be the guinea pig of the family.    </li>
<li> I also love the fact that the toothbrush has the quad pacer.</li>
<li> Love it for 6 years.  </li>
<li> Glad I made the switch to Sonicare.</li>
<li> My kids, who both have a mouthful of braces, use this toothbrush as well and both love it.</li>
<li> but I already love it.</li>
<li> With the latest research indicating that tooth decay raises one&#x27;s risk of HEART disease, this item may truly be a lifesaver, not just a way to stave off cavities.&lt;br</li>
<li> It does more than we can do ourselves</li>
<li> and I love the \\&quot;timer\\&quot; aspect.</li>
<li> dont get the  \\&quot;Better</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know about most people</li>
<li> but it isn&#x27;t watertight so despite best efforts stuff will get into the inner part of the brush/magnet unit that is factory sealed (I&#x27;m not talking about the removable threaded part that screws into the handle).</li>
<li> After using the Oral B now for about 2 month I have the feeling that the Oral B cleans my teeth better</li>
<li> I know that the expense puts this toothbrush out of reach for many people.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a great product, does a great job of preventing decay and other tooth problems when used  twice a day as directed.</li>
<li> This Elite sonicare really looks after your teeth in a very nice way.  </li>
<li> but it was kind of a hassle to prep and clean.</li>
<li> Like the older Sonicare line, this does a great job of cleaning your teath.  </li>
<li> After brushing for the programmed 2 minutes, your teeth feel very clean and refreshed.  </li>
<li> Your teeth and mouth feel very clean.  </li>
<li> I bought mine originally from an Amazon Marketplace vendor, and I was able to get a great price, much lower than buying it in the store.  </li>
<li> I just bought my new Sonicare and it works great.    </li>
<li> I love the toothbrush, although it does have a strong buzzing vibration to it.    </li>
<li> More important than just cleaning your teeth, it helps maintain healthy gums.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m a bit neurotic about cleanliness myself, and I have found it to be very easy to clean and quite sanitary.    </li>
<li> Very easy to use, maintain and keep clean.  </li>
<li> The Sonic Care makes my teeth feel so clean!  </li>
<li> and this toothbrush gets my teeth really clean!  </li>
<li> You will tongue your teeth more because they will feel smooth and polished.&lt;br /&gt;Okay</li>
<li> Most importantly is the size and shape of the head.  </li>
<li> It looks to be more cheaply made.</li>
<li> , it is lighter, and much more comfortable.  </li>
<li> I can&#x27;t speak to its durability yet, but I&#x27;m happy so far with its design and how it cleans my teeth.</li>
<li> Actually, great brushing action.  </li>
<li> A friend has the 7300 and the ergonomic design of the handle and skinner brush head makes it really much more comfortable.  </li>
<li> and I really feel good whit this tooth brush.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s fast and good quality.</li>
<li> But this toothbrush is better than my original:  </li>
<li> COOL!     </li>
<li> for a full charge!</li>
<li> The Sonicare Elite e7300 power toothbrush is a wonderful product which cleans your teeth extremely well.  </li>
<li> It came real quick and I love it more than the first two I had.</li>
<li> Clean your teeth with SOUND WAVES!</li>
<li> I would have given this toothbrush 5 stars easily if it weren&#x27;t for the cleaning issue.</li>
<li> I used to just brush my tongue, but that is not so easily done with this brush.</li>
<li> It is easy to use and easy to charge.  </li>
<li> Now I got that out of the way, I love this brush, its like coming out of the dentist after a teeth clean.    </li>
<li> It says you get two weeks&#x27; use out of one charge, to make it easy to travel with it.  </li>
<li> Just make sure to clean it as per the maintenance instructions</li>
<li> and I like the slim head which is easy to maneuver around the teeth.  </li>
<li> It is extremely easy to operate and program.</li>
<li> Can you think of anything better then that dentist clean feel?</li>
<li> but they were easy to put together and we charged them up the 24 hours they required.  </li>
<li> Easy to read battery meter shows when recharging is needed.  </li>
<li> family, however, needs all the help it can get, with teeth that decay easily, even if we avoid sweets.</li>
<li> It has a nice \\&quot;learning\\&quot; feature that starts the brush out at a fairly gentle aggitation and moves to the most vigorous level over the course of 15 day to give the novice user a chance to acclimate to the vibrating head (it can tickle quite a bit if you&#x27;re not used to it).  </li>
<li> I have a lower brace that tends to collect plaque and my gums would easily bleed at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
<li> (We have another Advantage that is going strong after around four or five years).</li>
<li> - the vibrations were too strong</li>
<li> Perhaps you&#x27;ve got strong teeth.</li>
<li> At first, the buzzing was VERY strong, which kind of made it funny to watch my sister get the giggles (if you are ticklish, WATCH OUT!)</li>
<li> Appears to do a fine job brushing my teeth, and is quite easy to use.</li>
<li> At first I thought that maybe spending $100 on a toothbrush seemed liked a lot, but then I realized that these are my teeth</li>
<li> and I believe the claims that the Elite is 20% more effective than older models.  </li>
<li> it seems, I loved this thing and every time i put on a new brush head</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s as good as (almost) new today.</li>
<li> The others worked fine but eventually the batterys started to wear out</li>
<li> 7300 does not come with any of that, and works just fine.  </li>
<li> - it&#x27;s fine just the way it is.</li>
<li> Despite my best efforts with my previous electric brush, all too often it would take two appointments just for a routine cleaning.</li>
<li> One of the cheaper brands will work just fine.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s sturdy and latches fine and the plastic in the hinges is made to benda lot.</li>
<li> Lucky me, I got to have one, too!  </li>
<li> I am sure it will enhance the dental treatments he has received and will make him feel more confident as he meets new people.</li>
<li> Use this along with those little brushes that go between teeth to get rid of plaque, and you will be very happy.  </li>
<li> My teeth feel smooth and my mouth feels refreshed.</li>
<li> It focuses on the brush stem and bristles, while the mold is in a sort of \\&quot;cavern\\&quot; that the light won&#x27;t reach.  </li>
<li> was entirely of smooth plastic.  </li>
<li> About 2 years ago, my dental hygenist recommended this toothbrush to me, and I didn&#x27;t buy it at the time, because I didn&#x27;t really want to spend that kind of money on a toothbrush.</li>
<li> Sonicare who confirmed it did not work</li>
<li> Sonicare who confirmed it did not work</li>
<li> But after a change, the 1st and the 2nd brush is still great.</li>
<li> if you know physics, you know vibration through a medium produces sound) and battery life.  </li>
<li> works great, teeth feel cleaner than with a regular tooth brush.</li>
<li> Just a fabulous design.</li>
<li> The instructions specify how to clean under the nut easily (the brush head pops out).</li>
<li> After 14 years, my sonicare has finally gone off to the great dentist in the sky.</li>
<li> Easy on gums, gets teeth clean.   </li>
<li> At my last 6-month checkup, my dentist literally exclaimed with joy at the lack of tartar build up, and the cleaning itself was a breeze.  </li>
<li> You&#x27;d think that this task could have been made easier with all the technology available.</li>
<li> I am, however, happy that I finally got one</li>
<li> You will actually enjoy brushing your teeth - look forward to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> If it&#x27;s not charging, don&#x27;t turn the light on.</li>
<li> I give it 3 stars for cleaning teeth and 0 stars for arrogant, cheap design and being overpriced.    </li>
<li> great design allows reaching way back on the molars.</li>
<li> I am writing this review more from the perspective of whether the Elite is worth $[$$]</li>
<li> I really do enjoy it -</li>
<li> Each head has a different colored band around the neck, which is great because you can share it with your partner and keep trackof which head is whose.  </li>
<li> the hygienest says it&#x27;s so easy for her to clean our teeth because we use the electric toothbrush.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s light weight.  </li>
<li> (And my primary dentist is NOT known for his raving.)</li>
<li> My 4700 obviously worked great (and still does), but</li>
<li> whether cheaper is better,   or price wins the day.     </li>
<li> it was that great feeling you can&#x27;t get from a regular toothbrush.</li>
<li> I still feel this is brush quite pricey, but overall I am happy with my purchase.</li>
<li> That&#x27;s enough to make any parent happy.</li>
<li> The 30 second timer does a great job of letting a user know when to move the brush.</li>
<li> So far so good.  </li>
<li> Smaller is better in terms of doing a good job of cleaning.</li>
<li> It may sound like a lot of money for a toothbrush, but it&#x27;s worth way more than what it costs.  </li>
<li> I am very pleased with my new Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
<li> Just clean the brush before putting it away and you should be fine.    </li>
<li> I meet compliment me on how white my teeth are and what a great smile I have!</li>
<li> This toothbrush does a fair job when the brush heads are new; however, they get \\&quot;mushy\\&quot; rather quickly and at $12.50</li>
<li> It is smaller, easier to handle, does not drip, easier to clean and does  great job on cleaning the teeth and gums</li>
<li> the new 7300&#x27;s smaller brush and lighter handle are really a perfect fit for me.</li>
<li> - teeth are cleaner yet not as clean and smooth as after dental cleaning despite the marketing claims.</li>
<li> I enjoy the invigorating feeling of it, and my mouth just feels so clean afterwards.</li>
<li> It went strong for a good 10 years before the battery finally quit on me.&lt;br</li>
<li> There is one significant downside which is that the battery cannot be replaced.  </li>
<li> The e7300 is lighter and more comfortable than my old 5300, and I think it does a better job cleaning my teeth.    </li>
<li> The timer effortlessly helps you be more consistent in your brushing behavior.</li>
<li> The biggest advantage of CVS is the significantly lower price for the unit, which includes the charger, a UV sanitizer and 3 brush heads.</li>
<li> My dentist reports a significant improvement in plaque.</li>
<li> off)&lt;br /&gt;Also, after six weeks of usage, one of the magnets on the Elite brush head appears to have rusted significantly.  </li>
<li> So far I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
<li> But even with the first use, I have to say that my teeth have never felt better or looked cleaner.  </li>
<li> If you&#x27;re going to make a battery operated toothbrush, you should make the battery  easily accessible to people.  </li>
<li> My brushing sessions are now more consistent and pain-free and my teeth are noticeably whiter and they feel exceptionally clean.</li>
<li> /&gt;This really is a great toothbrush, and I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ve managed without it for so long!</li>
<li> , it&#x27;s a pain to keep clean.  </li>
<li> To clean your handle, run a damp cloth around the recessed area once a week.\\</li>
<li> The toothbrush works well and keeps my teeth clean.</li>
<li> Yes you do need to clean the tongue, just don&#x27;t gag yourself.      </li>
<li> and there isn&#x27;t much to clean.</li>
<li> I can see a noticeable improvement in the color of my teeth and they feel so clean after use.  </li>
<li> You&#x27;ll have a dentist clean feeling twice a day, without all the poking and prodding.</li>
<li> Like everything else, take care of it and keep it clean.</li>
<li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how clean my teeth were after 2 minutes.  </li>
<li> but they were not truly up to the challenge of getting my teeth really clean and stain-free.</li>
<li> Now to see the same model for 100, anyone who is unsure whether or not it&#x27;s a good investment, I assure you, you will enjoy brushing your teeth.  </li>
<li> My teeth just don&#x27;t feel clean unless I use my Sonicare.  </li>
<li> I clean it every morning.</li>
<li> Not to mention that my mouth didn&#x27;t feel as clean.</li>
<li> Therefore, every couple of weeks, I clean the well and my brush head with a bleach solution to disinfect and deodorize everything.  </li>
<li> I have never felt my teeth so thoroughly clean before.  </li>
<li> It gets my teeth so clean.</li>
<li> I was very sceptical about spending this kind of money on a toothbrush, but this one is worth it.</li>
<li> I liked it enough to buy two more for my family</li>
<li> It give you a dentis clean feel every time you use it.</li>
<li> how could it give you a dentis clean feel heards</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t describe how clean it makes my mouth feel...</li>
<li> Each time I use the Sonicare, my mouth feels soooo clean.    </li>
<li> This toothbrush leaves your mouth feeling clean and invigorated.  </li>
<li> I would however recommend a newer version of the Sonicare Toothbrush that use the Brush Heads with push on connectors, making it easier to clean and maintain.</li>
<li> The toothbrush heads&#x27; bristles are curved to get in-between your teeth and to clean the surface of a tooth.</li>
<li> Their orthodontist has even made comments on how clean their teeth were.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m surprised there aren&#x27;t more complaints from users on how the brushhead&#x27;s design traps toothpaste and mouth gunk (yuck!)</li>
<li> Just ask any dentist it takes that much time to adequatly message the gums, a very important part of brushing.      </li>
<li> If he could build a savings account as fast as he builds plaque, we&#x27;d be very comfortable indeed.</li>
<li> my old handle sayed nice and clean becauseit</li>
<li> application at home because my teeth were still a bright white almost a year after the in office Zoom!</li>
<li> This is a GREAT product - we love the small brush head</li>
<li> , I find it easier to brush for recommended length and really want to make sure I take care of my mouth.  </li>
<li> The timer also forces me to brush for a full 2 minutes - 30 seconds for each quadrant of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Someone in another review remarked that you can&#x27;t brush your tongue with it, but if you really stiffen your tounge out it cleans it completely, much more efficiently than a manual brush or tongue scraper.  </li>
<li> Now we both have it full time.</li>
<li> Just be sure to replace the brush every 6 months, it really does make a difference.  </li>
<li> More importantly the brush head is smaller and is more of a diamond shape rather than the \\&quot;original\\&quot; rectangle.  </li>
<li> Good buy especially for the money.  </li>
<li> He told me that if I didn&#x27;t do something fast, I was going to lose most of my teeth.</li>
<li> necessary warning: it should be noted that Sonicare is not be good for everyone.</li>
<li> One full charge should keep you going for one week.</li>
<li> After all these years of using it twice-daily, it still runs for one week after a full charge.&lt;br</li>
<li> The tech support guys helped me reset it and told me to leave it on the set for 24+ hours to achieve a full charge.</li>
<li> It was a good product but only had a life of 18 mos.</li>
<li> Not bad at all.    </li>
<li> I bought this toothbrush based on the other good reviews and it was worth it!!  </li>
<li> The new angled head fit my mouth better</li>
<li> My only surprise with this one is the brushes themselves; the heads are smaller (that&#x27;s a good thing), but the bristles seem to be firmer (not so sure about that), and that&#x27;s true of the more colorful compact heads, too.  </li>
<li> It also leaves my teeth feeling fresh and clean after each brushing.</li>
<li> Much better than the older models.</li>
<li> But overall, good toothbrush, worth the money.   </li>
<li> As you get older you realize how really important that is!</li>
<li> After using the sonicare brush for a month, I&#x27;ve replaced it with the CVS sonic brush which to my opinion cleans better - bigger brush and better contact with teeth.</li>
<li> LOVE the 2 minute timer, and I just can&#x27;t say enough that I LOVE how my teeth feel.</li>
<li> I waited many months before purchasing this toothbrush, mainly because of the price.  </li>
<li> My teeth feel as clean as they did right after my dental check-up.</li>
<li> Had it for several months now and still very satisfied.</li>
<li> The design is very well thought out, reasonably comfortable to use, and from my recent dentist vist -- results are good too.</li>
<li> I guess I brush more than normal.</li>
<li> Following the recommendation of friends, we bought our very first electric toothbrush and have been very satisfied with the quality of the brushing.  </li>
<li> Overall, I am very pleased with the Oral B system and even my dentist thinks there is no difference in terms of effectiveness between both systems.  </li>
<li> (She can handle the vibrations about 90% of the time, but the Sonicare is still much easier for her to use than a regular toothbrush--and definitely more effective.)    </li>
<li> The new style, bent head and shaped brush, seems even better.  </li>
<li> This new unit is even better than the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The new model is also lighter, looks sleeker, and has a rubber grip (I love the tactile feel of those).</li>
<li> I have used a Sonicare for about 4 years and the new design is much better.</li>
<li> Very pleased with my new sonicare and all the improvements since my older version.</li>
<li> in all, the new model is more attractive, has a battery indicator, and the angled brush head is slightly easier to use.  </li>
<li> All in all, the new model is more attractive, has a battery indicator, and the angled brush head is slightly easier to use.  </li>
<li> The model is pricey, but works great and is easier to use than the previous heavier model.  </li>
<li> The brush is easily cleaned, reaches the back of the mouth easily, and is comfortable to use.</li>
<li> The shipping was fast and ordering was easy.  </li>
<li> I have ended up taking apart the factory sealed part by bending the plastic tabs and giving the inner parts a good hot water bath and scrubbing with a q-tip.</li>
<li> yes, the first one lasted 10 years!</li>
<li> I bought the original Sonicare when it first came out -- 20 years ago?</li>
<li> After a week or so, the brush&#x27;s strong massaging action began to feel really good, and I actually looked forward to brushing.</li>
<li> As others have said, your teeth truely feel like you came from the dentist, and it is very gentle on your gums.  </li>
<li> The light indicates how much battery life is remaining.  </li>
<li> While its a great product, i had few issues with this brush:    </li>
<li> Maybe it&#x27;s a different kind of smile now.</li>
<li> Take it from me, this brush is worth the money.    </li>
<li> Please note that if you&#x27;re not used to using a powerful electric toothbrush, it will take you about 2 weeks to get fully used to this toothbrush.</li>
<li> The e7300 has a battery charge indicator which is useful if you don&#x27;t leave the brush on the charger all the time.  </li>
<li> I like the sonic action better than rotary or slower-speed mechanical motion.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for about 6 months now and it has made my teeth feel fresh and polished after every use.  </li>
<li> Even though it&#x27;s pricey, the Sonicare Elite is easily worth it.  </li>
<li> The hygenist who works with her instantly remarked at how much she loved her sonicare.  </li>
<li> More frequently if you brush while in the shower.  </li>
<li> and it is defintely better than my old one.  </li>
<li> This is well worth the investment.  </li>
<li> Sure enough, you can put the handle in any which way and the charging light comes on.</li>
<li> But clearly they think they know what I need better than I do.    </li>
<li> Take that for what it is worth...</li>
<li> have a set that came with extra heads, a head storage stand, and a deluxe travel case.  </li>
<li> I had pockets of some degree or another around 80% of my teeth; on the 2nd visit, this had been reduced to about 10%, it was that effective on my teeth AND gums.</li>
<li> When I left the office, my dentist smiled at me and said, &amp;quot;Great job!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve covered it with clear tape and so far so good, but I have doubts about its longevity.</li>
<li> It is worth the money so pull the trigger.</li>
<li> What is worth noting is that, speaking for my self, my teeth have never been cleaner or healthier.</li>
<li> and I am likely to continue using it until something better becomes available</li>
<li> I know that these brushes are pricey, but they are worth it.</li>
<li> The handle is a nice size, and not too big (diameter-wise).  </li>
<li> Handy built in timer lets you know when to switch to the next quadrant of your mouth.  </li>
<li> Both make me much more conscious of putting in the time to do a thorough job of brushing.  </li>
<li> This is definitely a worth while investment.  </li>
<li> Ease of use encourages more frequent brushing.  </li>
<li> However, once you commit to the expense, it is well worth the money.</li>
<li> I believe that it has increased my dental &amp; gum health, which is worth a lot to me.</li>
<li> At a top of the line price, I expected more.  </li>
<li> Back off on the pressure, it does not take much pressure to clean effectively with Sonicare.      </li>
<li> My original one lasted over a year, but I used it very infrequently (never got hooked on it).</li>
<li> to see what I was getting into, and you&#x27;ve got to do this just right or the tickling of your lips will be unbearable.</li>
<li> right?</li>
<li> I am well please with the electric brush and recieve it right away.         </li>
<li> , I want to go brush my teeth right now.  </li>
<li> It really did clean as advertised.</li>
<li> The stains that were developing immediately began to disappear and my teeth looked much whiter and felt wonderfully clean in just a couple of weeks without any &amp;quot;extra whitening&amp;quot; toothpaste.</li>
<li> It works just fine, and my toothbrush looks brand new.  </li>
<li> We first bought this toothbrush through our dentist and it seemed worth the price tag.</li>
<li> All of the Sonicare toothbrushes apparently have better batteries now.  </li>
<li> Since they brag that the unit can be used for 2 weeks (twice a day) on a full charge, they are really asking me to stand there for an hour (2x2x14 minutes) and restart the unit 28 times.</li>
<li> This was $15 cheaper than where I normally shop at the Army Air Force Ecxhange and shipping was free.  </li>
<li> The first was my dentist had an operation and is out of the picture for a couple of months, right when its time to get a cleaning.</li>
<li> The result is they really work better than manual (just my experimental observation)</li>
<li> Since my dental health improved so much and so quickly, my husband also got one</li>
<li> If you leave the toothbrush together during travel, the brush head may get bent resulting in the toothbrush making a very loud rattling sound when in use.</li>
<li> so i cant fairly compare it to other models, but i will say that my teeth feel and look much cleaner than they did when i was brushing manaully.</li>
<li> This new slightly angled brush head is great.</li>
<li> My teeth feel so clean &amp;amp; my gums are getting more pink.</li>
<li> /&gt;12 months later, I still marvel at how smooth and clean my teeth feel after each brushing.  </li>
<li> My hygienist recommended the Philips Sonicare toothbrush to me a while back, and am I ever glad I listened to her.</li>
<li> It does what it advertises, which is why I bought another after my first one ran out of battery.</li>
<li> It cost too much like everything thats worth a damn.</li>
<li> Needless to say, the recipient is VERY impressed with the way it cleans her teeth.</li>
<li> but overall my mouth feels much better</li>
<li> And I just had my first dentist appointment since using the Sonicare and cleaning my teeth was a breeze for the hygenist...</li>
<li> The first time will be a shock and you&#x27;ll wonder how brushing your teeth with that toothbrush could ever be pleasurable.</li>
<li> and it really cleans and whitens your teeth!</li>
<li> This is my first electric toothbrush</li>
<li> , all the sonicare models do an outstanding job of keeping teeth cleaned, if used properly.  </li>
<li> As far as getting a good brushing it is fantastic but it has a design flaw that I would have thought they would have fixed long ago.</li>
<li> First we purchased an e7300.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> My first one lasted 7 years and then the battery gave out.</li>
<li> I used the Sonicare Elite for several years, buying the hype that it was cleaning my teeth better than I could.  </li>
<li> Absolutely leaves your mouth feeling fresh and massaged.</li>
<li> Yes, it will tickle at first when you just start using it</li>
<li> (forget the exact number) uses to allow you time to get accustomed to it.</li>
<li> This product works exactly as my dentist said it would.  </li>
<li> This is the first sonicare I have owned</li>
<li> The Elite series has a smaller head and comes off of the body of the brush at a more ergonomically functional angle.  </li>
<li> First of all, why are they shutting it off after 2 minutes?</li>
<li> I am told to first deplete the battery.</li>
<li> When my dentist sold me my first Sonicare, he told me that in his opinion using Sonicare is like having microsurgery for gum disease, without the trauma and</li>
<li> though)-I believe the higher model allows you to customize the timer to allow for additional brush time.  </li>
<li> This brush cleans very well!</li>
<li> My dentist recommended the Sonicare toothbrush at my most recent visit.</li>
<li> 18 months later: The on-button has a flexible covering that has now perforated at the top, allowing moisture to get inside the barrel.  </li>
<li> Higher on dollars --   e7300</li>
<li> The first time I thought it was a fluke</li>
<li> It was that much better and my teeth definitely has this sensation after I brush my teeth.</li>
<li> Amazon had the best price by far and I compared prices with the local Military Exchange too.  </li>
<li> I have to floss multiple times every day and water pick to keep my gums healthy.      </li>
<li> This toothbrush was worth every penny and will save me much money (and pain)</li>
<li> I think sonicare is better because of different motion than oral b.</li>
<li> (i.e. top front, top back, bottom front, bottom back).</li>
<li> Even after the first night of usage, I noticed a difference in the cleanliness of my teeth.    </li>
<li> It was recommended by a dentist, and despite the expense, I am not sorry I splurged.</li>
<li> Sounds funny but running the brush head through the dishwasher monthly seems to work.</li>
<li> The vibrating stick seems better from a hygiene standpoint and creates a similar amount of vibration.    </li>
<li> When we bought this model, we expected the same good performance we had from the original.  </li>
<li> If you don&#x27;t clean the underside of the head on older models, they get pretty gross very quickly.  </li>
<li> I definatly get a better clean than with conventional brushes.  </li>
<li> i bought this product since i constantly had gum problems (my gums used to bleed at times) and all the other reviews were right, it is a great product.</li>
<li> One caution, though: As I recall, when I stopped brushing long ago and got 9 cavities, several were on the chewing surfaces, so best to hit those too.&lt;br /&gt;[Months later]</li>
<li> The circular action doesn&#x27;t wear away the gum line, and my teeth are significantly cleaner.  </li>
<li> I would be surprised if this unit lasts even a fraction of the 20 years of the original unit.</li>
<li> I would also say that it is simply hard for me to believe any brush could work better or feel better than the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The thing I love most about my Sonicare is that I don&#x27;t have to brush hard.</li>
<li> I have been using the Sonicare toothbrush for many years and am pleased with the results (though I recommend that you not press too hard as it may damage your enamel over time).</li>
<li> The built-in timer is really nice, so that I know how much time I&#x27;ve spent on my mouth.</li>
<li> my old model, I never removed the brush heads except to change them and perhaps once a month to clean the built-up toothpaste that accumulated around the collar that secured the head to the handle.  </li>
<li> What most impresses me about the Sonicare, however, is how well thought out the design is (no doubt thanks to numerous preceeding trial and errors).</li>
<li> I had always thought that it was just a gadget made for people who had too much money or who simply had to have the latest electronic gadgets.  </li>
<li> can only appreciate how much cleaner your teeth are and how much better your gums feel by using this device.</li>
<li> such, I am not going to spend a lot of time commenting on the effectiveness of the sonicare approach in general (which I think is excellent) or in comparing it to other brands.  </li>
<li> (but without the sore gums).  Highly recommended and well worth the money, considering the benefits to oral health.</li>
<li> is it worth the high price?</li>
<li> He did compliment on the product and mention how most of his sonic toothbrush patients have comparably cleaner gum/teeth, but of course, that could just mean that people who use these ivory toothbrushs do care more about their oral hygiene than others.</li>
<li> Based on positive reviews and a tempting Gold Box offer, I gave the Sonicare Elite a chance.</li>
<li> The Oral B is well designed (with one minor annoyance) and it cleans better.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the original (\\&quot;Advanced\\&quot;) model because this one is so much better.</li>
<li> The brush head is smaller and more comfortable to use -- and it gets my teeth as white as they can be.  </li>
<li> us, the purchase of this has paid off handsomely in the long run.</li>
<li> We now emerge from dental appointments without a long list of cavities in need of fillings and there is no plaque on our teeth (most of the time).</li>
<li> I thought that the bells and whistle timer functions would be a waist of time (pun not intended) but they really help to keep you aware of what you are doing and where you are doing it.  </li>
<li> Also, toothpaste sticks to the rubber more readily than to the smooth plastic of the old model, making it slightly more difficult to keep clean.  </li>
<li> Also, toothpaste sticks to the rubber more readily than to the smooth plastic of the old model, making it slightly more difficult to keep clean.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had mine for a little over a month now and decided to see if the promise that it&#x27;s dishwasher safe was true.  </li>
<li> The snap on style heads available on some Sonicare models remain securely attached to the base unit and therefore, transfer the ultrasonic vibrations to the brush head and your teeth more effectively.</li>
<li> If you want a fantastic toothbrush that makes your mouth feel like you just had a professional cleaning - I highly reccommend this brush.</li>
<li> If it were only that easy.    </li>
<li> I can actually get to all of my teeth at all angles easily.</li>
<li> My dentist recommended sonicare because I was not getting my gumline top and bottom clean enough, and cavities were starting to form.  </li>
<li> For the slightly greater price I would recommend the model that has five 30-second cycles so that it is possible to clean the chewing surfaces of the back teeth without having to turn it on again.</li>
<li> But the unit obviously isn&#x27;t designed for the user to easily do this.  </li>
<li> -I always feel a surge of guilt when I turn it off prematurely, which may be a good thing because my teeth and gums (and wallet) will probably thank me in the long run for brushing properly.</li>
<li> It certainly helps with plaque control.</li>
<li> The improvement was pure Sonicare.</li>
<li> Worth the update even if your old style is still working!</li>
<li> Whereas the original has bristles that travel through a 90 degree arc, the Elite bristles barely travel at all.  </li>
<li> This brushing action is fantastic, just like the new one, but this design stinks...literally.</li>
<li> It greatly remove all dirty things in my mouth and easy to unse and brush.  </li>
<li> Water can seep in and remain trapped more easily than on the old model which had no opening at that location.  </li>
<li> I can barely feel the brush on my teeth, but my teeth feel really really clean afterwards.</li>
<li> The last one still worked fine when I replaced it 5 years ago</li>
<li> some genius figured, hey, just switch to a much higher vibration rate of the main mechanism, and that&#x27;s a beep.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m glad I upgraded to this new one because it reaches the rear, hard-to-reach areas much easier than the last one, thanks to the slimmer head and angled brush.  </li>
<li> Now you will have a nice little task of cleaning the mirror, the sink, your shirt, the wall, the floor...</li>
<li> I visited my dentist after using this item twice a day for six months and, for the first time ever, received high praise for my admirable oral care.  </li>
<li> I occasionally use my tooth whitener, but I use the Sonic Elite toothbrush twice a day and it truly makes a huge difference in the appearance of my teeth.</li>
<li> Really, my dentist smiles when I go in.</li>
<li> but this one really has improved his teeth.  </li>
<li> What I really like it the battery charge level LEDs on the barrel.</li>
<li> but it really seems to work.  </li>
<li> A sanitizer won&#x27;t help, either, because the location where the mold is growing is not likely to be exposed to the UV light in the charger.  </li>
<li> This was a lot of money, but I agreed that if I was going to spend $6000 on braces another $200 would be worth it if it meant the fixed teeth wouldn&#x27;t be cavity ridden when the braces came off.  </li>
<li> so I didn&#x27;t give it much thought about replacing it.</li>
<li> I was very amazed.  </li>
<li> it really works to take off plaque.</li>
<li> Well, there&#x27;s enough of a sounding board in it that the vibration makes sound waves, so</li>
<li> Sonicare is so gentle on your gums and just glides over your teeth.  </li>
<li> I really do like the thinner neck and would buy again.</li>
<li> , this brush gently cleans the backs with minimum motion on your part.&lt;br</li>
<li> once a week to keep my teeth stain free and white.</li>
<li> and I feel it has been worth the money thus far.  </li>
<li> I highly recommend it!</li>
<li> However, given how this brush really saves teeth and preserves their attractiveness, it is really a bargain.  </li>
<li> My teeth are much whiter now too.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s light, and the word \\&quot;elegant\\&quot; actually comes to mind.  </li>
<li> When you turn it on it vibrates (a lot) which created an intense tickling sensation on the inside of my cheeks and gums.</li>
<li> It has really helped my gums (in addition to flossing) according to my dental hygienist.</li>
<li> that the electronic scaler could not do the whole job anyway.</li>
<li> one week, my teeth were much whiter.</li>
<li> As time went by, my gums became pink and healthy looking.</li>
<li> /&gt;Sonicare use has really improved my gums which had been bleeding and  receeding.</li>
<li> I had 8 cavities filled, and a couple deep cleanings, and this toothbrush is what&#x27;s helping with the repair and maintenance of my teeth.</li>
<li> This toothbrush really cleans my teeth well.  </li>
<li> Just push the power button when you are ready to brush, put the brush against your teeth, move the brush around your mouth and let the brush do the rest of the work.</li>
<li> (\\&quot;e seventy-three hundred\\&quot;) --   this very brush here.    </li>
<li> The battery also lasts for a much longer time.    </li>
<li> I found it very convenient.&lt;br</li>
<li> I found it very convenient.  </li>
<li> They said his teeth were in fantastic shape and they no longer had that yellow film.  </li>
<li> I do not have to floss as much as I did before.  </li>
<li> The 7300 has the feature of the quad interval timer, which is very helpful.  </li>
<li> Feels like your teeth are much cleaner; faster to brush teeth</li>
<li> It cleans very well.</li>
<li> Only problem I&#x27;ve encountered is the sound of the toothbrush scares my dog.</li>
<li> It really helped improve the health of my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> This thing really works.</li>
<li> (Do you think China would really do that?)    </li>
<li> My dental hygienist can really tell the difference.</li>
<li> and I know it will be much easier</li>
<li> but otherwise, it is a very valuable toothbrush.</li>
<li> Important to remember that even a Sonicare is not a substitute for flossing into the deep gaps between teeth.  </li>
<li> It offers more features and it&#x27;s the same price,</li>
<li> I laughed at the one negative review of the travel case-</li>
<li> Two minutes is more than enough to complete a thorough brushing.  </li>
<li> I had an older model sonicare that i thought was great for a long time in fact i still have it use it for travel, anyway i think the elite 7300 power toothbrush is a great product and does just what it says, and if lasts half as long as my other sonicare i will buy another sonicare product.</li>
<li> There were several Sonicare brushes available when I went shopping, but I chose this one because it is more slim-line than some of the other models.  </li>
<li> I can&#x27;t attribute all of this to the Sonicare because I&#x27;m sure their treatment and my longer brushing sessions due to the Sonicare&#x27;s timer helped a lot too, but I&#x27;m confident that at least part of the improvement was due to the Sonicare&#x27;s superior cleaning.</li>
<li> The original Sonicare and the current Advance models have a large head which extends straight from the main body of the toothbrush.  </li>
<li> No matter what toothbrush or paste, including straight baking soda, I tried, they never felt clean enough.  </li>
<li> Make sure you clean the head and the handle at least weekly.</li>
<li> I won&#x27;t be giving you all any more updates, unless all of my teeth fall out due to the usage of this product.</li>
<li> Other things I love about it is the fact that it indicates when it is time to switch quadrants.</li>
<li> should disclose that as power toothbushes go, I have only ever used Sonicare, and started with the original design.</li>
<li> There are, however, lots of other features which make this a better brush.  </li>
<li> I feel that this product does a better job of cleaning and whitening my teeth than any other product I have used.  </li>
<li> My original Sonicare just started acting up.</li>
<li> is also angled to provide easier access to the back teeth and \\&quot;flexes\\&quot; both horizontally and vertically.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the Elite just does not seem as \\&quot;powerful\\&quot; as the original.  </li>
<li> No need for whitening strips and other products if you&#x27;re using the Sonicare, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
<li> The price of this, though   more reliable, cannot   beat the other&#x27;s cost.     </li>
<li> These older models use NiCad so they really should be recycled.</li>
<li> The small brushhead is great for getign around to your back teeth</li>
<li> I got a pack of extra heads and my husband tried it and said his teeth felt as clean as leaving the dentist.  </li>
<li> I have purchased a Braun Oral-B Triumph to replace it and it has been a much more economical alternative and functions just as well, if not better.</li>
<li> So, if you are on a moderate budget for a squeaky clean teeth and don&#x27;t mind shelling out a couple of \\&quot;jacksons\\</li>
<li> And sure enough, no matter how you put it in, even half falling out, the charging light lights up.</li>
<li> Does a terrific job of leaving teeth feeling clean.</li>
<li> After that visit, I did a little more research into the Sonicare and based on all of the positive reviews from both dentists and patients, I decided to go ahead and buy one.  </li>
<li> I have used the older model Sonicare for quite wome time;it was good but bulky and heavy, so I expected more of the same with the Sonicare Elite.  </li>
<li> The first time I used my old Sonicare</li>
<li> After the first time using it, it felt like I just had my teeth professionally cleaned.  </li>
<li> and you have to buy a whole new toothbrush.</li>
<li> The head has what appear to be magnets at the end of some good-sized struts, and apparently the electronics generate an oscillating magnetic field right through the plastic to shake them.</li>
<li> Sonicare cleans better than manual brushing... and requires less wrist/hand movement.</li>
<li> Try to protect the button with particular care.</li>
<li> You get the collers that screw on the main unit, not just the toothbrush head.  </li>
<li> While I&#x27;m writing to review the 7300, mine was a much older version.  </li>
<li> Still have the older version.  </li>
<li> But, of course, the main reason to get the Elite is because it will make your teeth cleaner and healthier than they&#x27;ve ever been before.</li>
<li> I had one of the older Sonicare models before the Elite came out.  </li>
<li> I have the older model of the Sonicare Elite e series.</li>
<li> After being examined by her the first time in June, I went back after having used the Sonicare consistently in September.</li>
<li> This is the classic razor/razorblade product approach.</li>
<li> I had an older model of the Sonicare and decided to upgrade  to this model.  </li>
<li> this particular model:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I am so glad that I got this specific toothbrush because no regular toothbrush gives me the cleanliness feeling that my Sonicare toothbrush gives me after brushing.</li>
<li> It is a replacement for an older model that has worn out.  </li>
<li> After 6+ years the white had discolored to an unattractive dull yellow, but it had the important advantage of being able to keep clean.  </li>
<li> would highly recommend this toothbrush.  </li>
<li> The hygenist gave me a high score on my dental hygiene.  </li>
<li> I highly recommend it.</li>
<li> I highly recommend it.</li>
<li> but I figured that if it was so highly recommended I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
<li> I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
<li> highly recommend this unit to anyone with recurring periodontal issues.  </li>
<li> Highly recommended.</li>

<li> While this brush may seem expensive, factor in 14 years of use and the cleanest teeth ever, and it really becomes a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to start shopping for a new one.</li>
<li> My teeth feel really clean after each use (as compared to a manual brush) and it stays charged for a long time.</li>
<li> I knew an electric toothbrush would make a significant difference my dental health, but my teeth look and feel much cleaner than I expected.    </li>
<li> Only an independent lab would know, but by my experience of 4yrs with the original Sonicare has done wonders for my teeth!</li>
<li> I first bought an a4100 which lacked a major feature; then I got this one.  </li>
<li> A single charge lasts many sessions and the unit simply drops into its charger as simple and sweet as you&#x27;d ever want.</li>
<li> I bought my first and only Sonicare model after very high recommendations by my periodontist.</li>
<li> * battery indicator - shows when charging (which old one had) and shows how much charge remains</li>
<li> The only complaint I have is that when you replace the toothbrush in the charger, it must be seated precisely to charge, otherwise it keeps blinking causing you to return to make sure it&#x27;s seated correctly.  </li>
<li> Not a big deal, but worth noting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Not a big deal, but worth noting.    </li>
<li> Pluses: Way powerful brush initially.</li>
<li> Personally, I don&#x27;t think the LEDs are worth it.  </li>
<li> After a few days with the Oral B, it has lost most of the yellowing.</li>
<li> but I don&#x27;t find it particularly necessary or useful.  </li>
<li> Now she even takes it with her on business trips rather than a normal toothbrush.    </li>
<li> /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s simply no complaint about the toothbrush at all except maybe the cost.</li>
<li> Battery lasts about 8 days in normal use (2 times a day).</li>
<li> Does a good job brushing, but will send you to the poor house.</li>
<li> new design looks attractive now, with its accenting blue rubber sides; however, that rubber is very likely going to fade and discolor relatively quickly, unlike the previous model which took a very long time before it started to look shabby.  </li>
<li> The new design looks attractive now, with its accenting blue rubber sides; however, that rubber is very likely going to fade and discolor relatively quickly, unlike the previous model which took a very long time before it started to look shabby.  </li>
<li> I was lucky enough to get one (the e7300 model), for about $80 from Amazon back when it was being first introduced in 2008.</li>
<li> Anyway, charging is apparently also by transformer action right through the plastic.</li>
<li> It works even better than the old one and cost a bit less.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s right next to your head.    </li>
<li> I had the original type for about 6 years - maybe it had gotten weak or maybe there is a difference, but this new one is really strong.  </li>
<li> I had my first one for 3 years before I felt it was to gross and bought a new one, but it still worked!  </li>
<li> , the Sonicare is a little pricey and the &amp;quot;sonic action&amp;quot; takes some getting used to, but the pay off of healthy teeth and gums far outweighs those considerations.</li>
<li> I live in Nevada.  </li>
<li> Admittedly, the new sides make it easier to grip.  </li>
<li> My daughter loves her new Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
<li> The new FlexCare model solves this.    </li>
<li> When I&#x27;m finished brushing, my teeth feel brand new...</li>
<li> I like the thinner toothbrush and the 30-second timer in this new model.  </li>
<li> We can&#x27;t live without our electric toothbrush and would urge everyone to buy this brand.</li>
<li> It has been about a month now with the new electric toothbrush</li>
<li> The new design eliminates all that slew of slime.</li>
<li> I just received this new model.</li>
<li> The new one exceeded my expectations.  </li>
<li> We upgraded to the new FLEXCARE</li>
<li> and I now have a brand new toothbrush.</li>
<li> this is my handle&#x27;s Swan Song, I won&#x27;t think twice before paying over $100 for a new one.</li>
<li> I am also considering this new toothbrush that claims to emit ultrasonic waves while brushing, which was featured on the Pop Sci magazine...</li>
<li> After I got my new toothbrush, my mom expressed to me the importance of taking care of it because it was pricey for \\&quot;just a toothbrush.\\&quot;</li>
<li> I have had this model over 2 years and it still works like new.</li>
<li> I had a problem with over-brushing before but now with this new Sonicare</li>
<li> but I wanted to upgrade to the new Activator.  </li>
<li> my mouth feels super clean after brushing and my gums have hardly ever bled since i started using this.</li>
<li> they could definitely tell the difference between my using a Sonicare vs. a regular brush (or a cheap electronic toothbrush knockoff).    </li>
<li> Our whole family used the same toothbrush, thanks to the interchangeable heads.</li>
<li> My old Sonicare Essence lasted quite a few years without any glitch until the batteries would not hold charge any more.</li>
<li> I was skeptical at first, but after using it for one month I am very glad that I purchased it.  </li>
<li> The brushing action of the Elite series is an improvement over the older models.</li>
<li> still don&#x27;t floss as I should, but my gums are pink, now and the pockets aren&#x27;t as deep and most have disappeared.  </li>
<li> I only wish it was available when I was younger.</li>
<li> but I see no good cleaning methods suggested, and the Sonicare website makes it sound like it&#x27;s a breeze to clean once a week: \\&quot;Wipe away any residue you find, including the area covered by the cuff, with a soft cloth or paper towel.</li>
<li> It was a little more than I wanted to spend on a toohbrush, but with the gums my mother gave me, I know its a worthy investment and will likely decrease my future dentist bills.</li>
<li> After my first generation Sonicare unit stopped working, I decided to go back to a manual toothbrush, since I didn&#x27;t want the expense of a new Sonicare.</li>
<li> She had a different model by a different manufacturer and this one definitely works much better.</li>
<li> After I started using the Sonicare, every time I went to the dental hygienist or ortho assistant (and these people were in different offices &amp; rotated, so the original recommending dentist was not getting a kick back)</li>
<li> Even if you prevent only one cavity (which going by my family&#x27;s history, it absolutely does), the Sonicare will pay for itself!</li>
<li> WOW!  </li>
<li> But no, the continued whiteness is just from regularly using the Sonicare Elite toothbrush (with Crest&#x27;s Rejeuvenating Effects toothpaste, if anyone is interested).   </li>
<li> The brush head is much smaller than the old dynosaur I had, and it doesn&#x27;t buzz as much, and doesn&#x27;t spray toothpaste around much at all.  </li>
<li> I bought this model as an upgrade to my old Sonicare (which gave me about 8 years of use!).  </li>
<li> It is angled and that makes it easier to use, so you&#x27;re able to get into areas you usually cannot.  </li>
<li> had my first post-Sonicare cleaning just last week.</li>
<li> It was answered by someone speaking perfect American English who, patiently, helped me recognize the &#x27;tones&#x27; the toothbrush was producing every 30 seconds - silly me, I was expecting to hear some &#x27;beep&#x27; while the toothbrush signals the 30-second via a change in the vibration pitch.is included.</li>

<li> I already have one and feel like it cleans my teeth better than an ordinary toothbrush.</li>
<li> This was my first electric toothbrush and after only two weeks of using it coffee stains are gone and my teeth are getting whiter every day.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it in the long run.</li>
<li> The Elite e7300 is my second Sonicare toothbrush (6 1/2 years until the first couldn&#x27;t be recharged).  </li>
<li> It will tickle your nose a bit at first, but you definitely get used to it, as you get used to the extreme clean it provides.</li>
<li> I had an old Sonicare for almost 5 years and the battery ... out on me, so I decided to get a new one.  </li>
<li> My old one sprang to life when I purchased the new one.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m curious to see how long this unit lasts, because it seems that many people complain of Sonicares dying after a year.  </li>
<li> , I&#x27;m not real keen about having black mold 3 inches from my mouth, even if it is trapped inside the \\&quot;guts\\&quot; of the brush head and not on the brushes/stem itself.dull yellow, but it had the important advantage of being able to keep clean.  </li>
<li> With the new one is so much easier to reach the back teeth.</li>
<li> However, I have a sneaking suspicion the rubber is going to fade and look old more quickly than my older model which was entirely white plastic except for a single small on/off</li>
<li> flossing is easier since using this tooth brush cleans better than the manual ones ( gross I know but much less gunk )</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;d like to have my original teeth as long as possible.</li>
<li> The gap isn&#x27;t large, but is visible to the naked eye.  </li>
<li> The gap isn&#x27;t large, but is visible to the naked eye.  </li>
<li> It certainly was in the last razor I purchased.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t they have engineers smart enough to figure that out?</li>
<li> Buy this or try two of those;   Less than three duds wins!</li>
<li> The technology clearly works.</li>
<li> This is a clear case of terminal helpfulness.     </li>
<li> This way I always know how much charge I have left and don&#x27;t have to keep it on the charger all of the time.</li>
<li> Your teeth really do feel like you just left the dentist.  </li>
<li> Given the need to conserve resources and the considerable expense of the brush</li>
<li> The thirty second timer is a really helpful tool.     </li>
<li> (which old one did not have)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> On my old model, I never had a mold problem - ever.  </li>
<li> However, I don&#x27;t ever recall dropping my old handle because it was overly slippery and</li>
<li> Now the crack has almost made a complete circle around the button.</li>
<li> Today it just died completely and it has not even been two years yet.</li>
<li> It is for real and uses the same heads as the Elite.  </li>
<li> The action is identical.  </li>
<li> Wish we had had this in the early 60&#x27;s when I was growing up.</li>
<li> I got a killer deal (50 percent off regular price), so that really influenced my decision.  </li>
<li> However, I also have sensitive gums and my dentist had been recommending one of these for a while.  </li>
<li> Not too far off the mark,</li>
<li> I was surprised that the Sonicare Elite&#x27;s reading was OFF THE CHART, producing over 200 milligauss.  </li>
<li> I really like the smaller handle with the rubber sides.  </li>
<li> I think I&#x27;m getting the hang of it, and I rather like the brushing action.</li>
<li> I really think it will save money on dental work in the future.</li>
<li> So far she has not been concerned.  </li>
<li> Our old one \\&quot;died\\&quot; and we had to order another one in a hurry.  </li>
<li> and I admit that I prefer it quite a bit to the old manual one.  </li>
<li> The battery did not die on me, but the rubber button that covers the power switch developed a tear and thus allowing water into the chamber where the electronics reside.</li>
<li> recently my old model died, refusing to take a charge after about 13 years.  </li>
<li> old Sonicare did not have the Quad Pacer feature which this does</li>
<li> If you are looking to replace your old one or want to get an powered toothbrush I would recommend.</li>
<li> nice feature is that it is less messy than my older model.  </li>
<li> I agree completely.  </li>
<li> I really appreciate the 30 second beeps, so I know to change quadrants.  </li>
<li> I used to toss my old one in my dopp kit, which is probably why it broke</li>
<li> I have since junked this thing and bought an Oral B Sonic Complete.</li>
<li> Oral B S-320 Sonic Complete Rechargeable Power Toothbrush]])</li>
<li> While the \\&quot;original\\&quot; brush head will not fit the Elite handle, the Elite brush head WILL fit the \\&quot;original\\&quot; handle.  </li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t reached for \\&quot;old</li>
<li> Granted, I hadn&#x27;t had a professional cleaning in over 2 years.</li>
<li> I have no complaints thus far.</li>
<li> I was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
<li> But the old one kept me out of the perio&#x27;s chair, and this one will too, and that&#x27;s what counts.    </li>
<li> but I guess applying common sense makes more sense here.</li>
<li> It is an addition to the old one</li>
<li> I have used a Sonicare toothbrush for about five years, and the old one was beginning to wear out.</li>
<li> The 2 minute cycle is marked by &#x27;tones&#x27; every 30 seconds</li>
<li> My one call to customer service went very well, back in 2005.</li>
<li> + My one call to customer service went very well, back in 2005.</li>
<li> Well basicly and um scientificly it spins realy fast so it polishes your teeth and gets all the junk out of the crevices.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t think the Quadpacer would be a big deal, but I really like this feature.  </li>
<li> No need to scrub your gums till they bleed, just guide the brush over your teeth and let the patented sonic action take care of the rest.  </li>
<li> I went to the dentist in early June.  </li>
<li> I replaced my old Sonicare with this one</li>
<li> With regular toothbrushes, I would apply too much force that all my bristles would bend outwards.</li>
<li> , my teeth felt much cleaner then when using a regular brush.</li>
<li> If your parents have dentures and they aren&#x27;t particularly old, take heed...and get thee to a store NOW and purchase this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> You can really see the difference, If you smoke the yellow starts to fade away.</li>
<li> The brush provides a professional cleaning every time you brush.</li>
<li> The Oral B S-320 Sonic Complete is lighter than the Sonicare Elite.  </li>
<li> 3 replacement heads for Oral B Sonic Complete are $18 on Amazon; 2 brush heads for the Sonicare system are between $23 and $28 on Amazon.  </li>
<li> Since using the Sonicare daily, I do not have as much build up</li>
<li> I use the Elite model for travel, but still use my Advance model for everyday cleaning and actually like it better</li>
<li> It is small, holds a charge for a long time and cleans your teeth and gums effectively.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s one of the few things I&#x27;ve purchased that I really think is worth the money.</li>
<li> Weird is good.</li>
<li> In order to minimize this, I take the head off after each use, shake the water out of the well, and allow the unit to air-out while it sits in the charger base-but the smell still happens, albeit more slowly.</li>
<li> a product as expensive as this, stay away unless replacing it every 15 months is within your plan as it does do a good job cleaning your teeth.</li>
<li> They stay clean much longer and my gums are no longer getting scrubbed too hard.  </li>
<li> My old regular toothbrush did not clean my teeth half as good.</li>
<li> had the original Sonicare a few years ago, but it died on me.</li>
<li> I imagine the 7500 will give you similar results to the 7300, so it just comes down to deciding whether or not to spend the extra bucks for some cute lights.  </li>
<li> It seemed like a decent electric toothbrush except that crud would collect in the handle- gross.  </li>
<li> Her first concern was that the brush was smaller than her prior model.  </li>
<li> but the brush actually ramps itself up over the first ten or so</li>
<li> It does a much better job at getting into small spaces and cleaning back teeth.</li>
<li> If you have an older model, definitely consider upgrading to the Elite.  </li>
<li> next 3-month checkup after starting to use my Sonicare was the first one in my life where I had no cavities, no work to be done, and no bleeding gums.  </li>
<li> this is my second one I purchased, had the older model for 4 years.</li>
<li> It is easy to use, travels well in the little case, and can hold a charge for several days if you are away from your charger.  </li>
<li> Also, it is a little pricey, but doing a little bit comparison shopping to find a better price really pays off.  </li>
<li> was hoping the Elite series  would have improved on the older Advance series design that was hard to keep clean but not so.</li>
<li> in all, I highly recommend the Sonicare, especially for people with dental problems.</li>
<li> It is not a normal size,but i&#x27;m sure it can be replaced with a little bit of research.  </li>
<li> * charger - the new charger has open sides, unlike the old model which was a sealed \\&quot;well\\&quot; that would trap water and give rise to gunk build up.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;d to seal the cleft on the button with tape, but no way to get back to normal function.</li>
<li> The brush head is small enough that I can get a very thorough brushing without causing harm to my gums, and the quadpacer feature is a helpful reminder to brush for 2 full minutes.</li>
<li> Hopefully, our next trip to the dentist will show that this toothbrush is as we both believe removing more plague than the oral-b. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While the toothbrush is more expensive than the oral-B, the refills are not far from the same.  </li>
<li> The carry case will outlast the toothbrush if they only last a few years like many people are saying.</li>
<li> The tickle factor was only the first couple of uses and then it moved past that - but try to avoid hitting your teeth with the plastic part because you&#x27;ll feel the vibrations right through your skull.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll be going back to a new Braun.</li>
<li> The new plastic travel case is obviously cheaper to make and a money saver for Philips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> The new 7300 features a brush head that is like a regular toothbrush in size and shape.</li>
<li> and they send me a brand new Sonic (different model) within 4 days.  </li>
<li> I can say that now I feel less self-conscious when I smile.  </li>
<li> It is so much easier brushing your teeth with Sonicare then with a regular manual toothbrush, we will never go back to manual brush.</li>
<li> My ten year old daughter who hates going to the dentist loves to use it!</li>
<li> I do feel like my teeth are cleaned better used this toothbrush than anything I&#x27;ve every tried outside a dentist&#x27;s cleaning, but it&#x27;s a pretty expensive option for a toothbrush.</li>
<li> My dentist has said that it has made a major difference in the amount of plaque, etc.</li>
<li> /&gt;For what you pay for the unit this is a major design flaw IMO.</li>
<li> Little pricey but worth the money</li>
<li> It finally pooped out after many years of use and several hard falls onto my ceramic tile bathroom floor.</li>
<li> In fact I never would have thought of upgrading except for the fact that I was doing lots of traveling and the older models didn&#x27;t keep their charge very long.   </li>
<li> I would recommend the Oral-B Sonic complete toothbrush which cleans as well as Sonicare, has a better brush (larger, smother), is easier to clean, and is less expensive.</li>
<li> but i am not sure whether it really whitens the teeth, i don&#x27;t notice much of a difference there.  </li>
<li> barely any plaque to scrape off at all.</li>
<li> * Handle - my old handle was constructed entirely of plastic, with no rubberized sides.  </li>
<li> Thats because of the fact that I charged and drained the battery completely on the initial charge and continued to do so</li>
<li> I recently had a professional teeth cleaning.  </li>
<li> When I realized it had been nearly 16 months, I finally screwed up the courage to go.</li>
<li> I find the 7300 far easier to maneuver, but that&#x27;s just my personal experience.</li>
<li> you frequently travel internationally, like me, you should note that the unit holds its charge for up to 2 weeks.</li>
<li> Three months was too much --   for the cheaper brush was crushed.   </li>
<li> but when i decided to give this a try, it changed the way i looked at my cross action toothbrush.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare brushes for, apparently, 7-8 years</li>
<li> My husband has sensitive gums therefore, it is a struggle for my him to brush and floss regularly.  </li>
<li> But, its only been a week so far</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a geek... and often find myself in love with the newest toy or gadget just to have my heart broken when it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
<li> The dental tech recommended this unit, and after using it for a few months, I returned to the Dentist and was given a very positive diagnosis.  </li>
<li> The hygienist had to scale (and scale, and scale) by hand - because my teeth and gums were very sensitive, and because I had such deep &amp;quot;pockets&amp;quot; (yes, gum disease!)</li>
<li> Gives you the clean feeling a regular toothbrush doesn&#x27;t usually give you.  </li>
<li> : you have to keep the threads clean as water gets in and causes the gunk; brush seems kinda small would prefer a larger brush; the settings and timings are too gimicky for me</li>
<li> The toothbrush vibrated very weakly yet made a very noisy rattling sound.  </li>
<li> In my opinion, the new model is a poor design and the company is going to have a significant problem until they redesign the brush heads and eliminate this rubber seal entirely, reverting back to a completely encapsulated design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> There&#x27;s been absolutely no mechanical problems with any part of it, or any \\&quot;cosmetic\\&quot; flaws, after 4 months of use, still looks brand new!</li>
<li> The standard brush head on the 4700 was a little big to easily reach my back teeth (but I have a pretty small mouth.)</li>
<li> The thing I don&#x27;t like about both sonicare and CVS brushes is that they don&#x27;t use regular rechargable batteries so when their battery dies in a few years you will have to throw away the whole unit and get a new one.</li>
<li> (I don&#x27;t disagree at all) but seem to overlook the poor design of the brushhead that allows gunk to build up quickly - even with a reasonably thorough \\&quot;cleaning\\&quot; following Sonicare&#x27;s recommendations.</li>
<li> I am petite, and found that some of the other models to be too big and less comfortable to hold.    </li>
<li> When it wears out apparently your only option is to discard the unit.  </li>
<li> br /&gt;We have used the oral-B toothbrush for several years, however, my teeth have not ever felt as clean before and I am somewhat of a fanatic when it comes to brushing.  </li>
<li> And remember to clean the whole unit at least once a week, as water &amp; toothpaste can seep down into the inner workings.</li>
<li> I thought those simple little rotary toothbrushes were pretty nifty when they came out</li>
<li> I had this product for the pass 2.5 years and guess what, the brush is very weak compare the how it was originally since the battery is older.</li>
<li> First impressions are that Philips went for glitz over quality and has added all kinds of marginally useful or even useless \\&quot;features\\</li>
<li> I replaced it only because the non-user-replaceable battery finally gave up the ghost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general</li>
<li> On a subsequent visit to my dentist for a cleaning, I was in so much pain when the hygenist was scraping the plaque and tartar off of my teeth, that I had tears rolling down my face, and she offered me novacane.  </li>
<li> My husband went on a business trip for a week and took a regular toothbrush, thinking it wouldn&#x27;t be that much of a difference (remember he&#x27;s had the Sonicare less than a month).  </li>
<li> &quot;  I think the new Extreme should work well with rechargable AA.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m gotten better though, so there&#x27;s usually just a little foam dribble now!</li>
<li> The only thing that I dislike about my Sonicare Elite 7300 is that water gets collected on the inside part of the handle and if you don&#x27;t detach your brush and dry it out or clean it out, it could start to smell or get hard water stains.</li>
<li> Some of the downsides include a battery that is not replaceable (a NiCd battery which unfortunately can suffer from the memory effect if not charged correctly), it doesn&#x27;t circulate toothpaste around the mouth as well for that clean fresh breath, and I suppose it is a little on the pricey side.  </li>
<li> This was very important for me as I have a very painful form of neuropathy/nerve disease, so it hurts to hold or manipulate a regular toothbrush,Sonicare allows me to effectively clean my teeth and tongue.</li>
<li> In the original unit, the handle goes well over an inch into the base and there is only one way it will fit.</li>
<li> thing that takes getting used to is the amount of foam the brush generates due to its sonic action</li>
<li> I bought two Sonicare Elite 7300 toothbrushes - one for my husband and I and the other for my 10yr old son.</li>
<li> So I looked at other products and found the Oral B S-320 Sonic Complete system.  </li>
<li> Instead, I&#x27;m going to focus here strictly on comparing the new Elite model to the previous model which used so-called \\&quot;standard\\&quot; sonicare brush heads rather than \\&quot;elite\\&quot; brush</li>
<li> the new model, however, I began to see the appearance of black mold within 2-4 weeks of purchase.  </li>
<li> * Handle seal - the handle&#x27;s cover has a very small gap around the circumference, right below the threads where the brush head attaches.  </li>
<li> * Handle seal - the handle&#x27;s cover has a very small gap around the circumference, right below the threads where the brush head attaches.  </li>
<li> The first time I used it was rather comedic - I tried to stop the brush (the on/off button is hard to push), took the brush out of my mouth before it finished and promptly splashed everything around me (including myself).</li>
<li> I also really like the new thin, angled brush head</li>
<li> The one drawback so far is that the travel case has a flimsy plastic latch on it that looks like it may only last a few times opening and closing.</li>
<li> The battery lasts long enough to take the brush with you on a two week trip.  </li>
<li> It took me a long time to make the switch from a regular toothbrush to an electric one.  </li>
<li> one day the brush just stop charging and no matter how long it is left on the charger</li>
<li> I only noticed very little difference in using this sonicare model and my old manual toothbrush...not enough to run out and spend $100.00 on another bursh next time.  </li>
<li> Again, the only drawback I can see if the on/off button - it really needs to be pushed hard.  </li>
<li> Overall a major improvement over any other toothbrush!  </li>
<li> In the original model, I could at least turn off the 30-second reminders by holding the on/off button for a few seconds -- simple.</li>
<li> /&gt;First, let&#x27;s talk about the relatively few things I like about the new model:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Brushing with the Sonicare 7300 is like brushing with a new toothbrush everyday.   </li>
<li> Now, I&#x27;ve taken to removing the brush head after every use to allow everything to air dry properly.  </li>
<li> Now, I&#x27;ve taken to removing the brush head after every use to allow everything to air dry properly.  </li>
<li> so it&#x27;s easy to put it in wrong.</li>
<li> , it is pricey, but far less costly than lots of fillings, root canals, bridges, etc.</li>
<li> but I wouldn&#x27;t put something near my mouth festering with bacteria and black mold.</li>
<li> I was sold by the Sonic toothbrush ad frequently shown on TV and after juggling between the few different brands out there, eventually I picked up the Philips Sonicare 7300.</li>
<li> but if you&#x27;re only replacing them every 6 months, it&#x27;s really not that big of a deal.</li>
<li> I was annoyed by the very first page of the manual.</li>
<li> Water seeps into the hollow compartment and is very hard to clean.</li>
<li> The condition of my gums was so much improved and there was hardly any buildup of plaque or tartar.  </li>
<li> I have no idea if this is dangerous, but it&#x27;s more than 10x stronger than a hair dryer -- and</li>
<li> - I find that the brush turns off before I&#x27;m finished brushing, but this is a minor annoyance.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited this long before purchasing this.  </li>
<li> It didn&#x27;t take long to get used to the power of the brush since it will build up the intensity over a week or 2 for easier transition from manual to powered brush.     </li>
<li> Two minor complaints are the noise it makes</li>
<li> It hasn&#x27;t been happening at all for a long time.</li>
<li> , my mouth feels like I just left the dentist (minus the pain and lectures on tooth decay).  </li>
<li> A long time ago my husband and I used one of those water jet tooth brushes.</li>
<li> Keeps the charge a long time too.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time</li>
<li> had used the Sensonic to help control a minor periodontal condition.  </li>
<li> I hate to see it because Oral B served me good.</li>
<li> The big black mark (and I do mean black literally) is that there is a significant problem with mold build-up on this</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried using rubbing alcohol and a cotton swab to clean it, but it&#x27;s still disgusting because nothing will fit into those tiny crevices.</li>
<li> I had tried older versions of this product a few years ago and found them awkward, but this model is truly comfortable to use.</li>
<li> this point I am still not sure on whether to get a new one or not because of this coincidence, I also like to know if there are other users who had or not had the same problem.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t have to wonder if you brushed long enough it brushes for 2 minutes and cuts off (mindless</li>
<li> My wife thought it a bit expensive when we first bought it, but now (because I travel) we actually bought a SECOND one.  </li>
<li> The Elite e7300 is lighter than the Advantage and somewhat easier to use, due to the smaller diameter of the shaft.</li>
<li> But on the other hand, some people like larger things stuck in their mouth, so it that&#x27;s the case, go for the $20 savings and get the 4300.  </li>
<li> Performs way above what I expected!</li>
<li> The reviewers who complain about the product being difficult to clean or about grime or build-up under the nut probably did not read the instruction manual.</li>
<li> People accuse me of being a walking commercial, but when you find something this great - you&#x27;ve just got to share the joy.&lt;br /&gt;Before Sonicare, visiting my dentist was always a really horrible experience.</li>
<li> I rinse the brushhead, wipe it as dry as I can and remove it from the handle  after each use to air</li>
<li> dry-</li>
<li> I have been using the sonicare for several years and I should have notified everyone with the trouble with this unit at an earlier date.</li>
<li> The charger is only 110V and can be a trouble when traveling outside US.    </li>
<li> I had no new cavities ever since and my dentist is no longer worried about my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I bought the model which comes with 2 heads for my husband and myself and the single head model for my daughter and one for my son who is away at college.  </li>
<li> and then some on a single charge.</li>
<li> I have used this toothbrush for over 3 years, and have never had a single problem with it.</li>
<li> My dentist and I agree that Sonicare product use improves dental health, making regular checkups &amp; cleaning a minor event (compared to previous de-scaling and stain removal sessions).  </li>
<li> We previously had the old model and when the battery ran down we had to throw the unit away (after recyling the battery of course).  </li>
<li> Sure enough, I ran it (the base, not the brush) through a dish cycle last night.  </li>
<li> I thought the timed cleaning cycle would take too long or that my permanent partial might be damaged by it.</li>
<li> I had been in the chair only a few short minutes when, after picking at my teeth a little and blinking her eyes a lot, the hygienist abruptly left the room.</li>
<li> The only thing we had a problem with was my son&#x27;s brush started to get dirty looking inside so now he separates the brushead after cleaning his teeth instead of leaving it all as one and both the charger and brush stay clean</li>
<li> I was about to throw out the 3rd one until i pressed the button and held it down as if I were resetting it and it worked, but I need to do that EVERY time now.</li>
<li> It tells me to make sure the handle is properly seated in the base, because if it is put in wrong, the charging light may still come on, but it won&#x27;t charge.</li>
<li> The new design seems like it will stay cleaner and inhibit model or mildew...at least on the charger base itself&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* angled brush head - the angle of the \\&quot;elite\\&quot; design makes it easier to clean behind your teeth and is used even in most non-electric toothbrushes today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The two minute cycle is really not that long and using it on my partial hasn&#x27;t caused a problem.   </li>
<li> I also have crowded teeth due to my wisdom teeth, which make it especially hard to clean in the back of my mouth.</li>
<li> This unit was designed to fail early so that you would buy a new one.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s honestly almost impossible to get the battery without destroying your toothbrush... which I did.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s not waterproof, so eventually the batteries get wet and that just makes a big mess.  </li>
<li> Only wish the toothbrush heads would be a little cheaper.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a hard plastic with soft, bendable plastic serving as the hinge.</li>
<li> They both told me that the tooth brush went dead at around the same time, a little bit later than the warranty ends.</li>
<li> The only negative was the brush head and handle was considerably larger than the Elite 7300.  </li>
<li> I think that is how I killed the battery last time after on two years.  </li>
<li> (\\&quot;Tired of hearing you talk about it\\&quot; was how I believe they put it) because as much as I wanted one, I couldn&#x27;t justify spending $120 on a toothbrush.  </li>
<li> The replacement CVS brush heads are way cheaper than the sonicare ones which appparently are made of gold, otherwise I can&#x27;t understand why I am expected to pay $25-$35 for</li>
<li> As the brush head enters its third, fourth or fifth month of service I can only assume that the changes for decreased performance would increase.  </li>
<li> I know it&#x27;s expensive, but your teeth are worth it.  </li>
<li> (save only a few).     </li>
<li> and then it totally stopped working; the green button started to tear inwards about 2 months ago and now it will not turn on nor recharge.</li>
<li> It took a few days before I was accustomed to the vibration of the brush on my lips, but that was my only problem.  </li>
<li> did have a Sonicare about 10 yrs ago but never really used it cause I couldnt build up to it</li>
<li> /&gt;Whenever you have an appliance like this in a wet environment you have to take care of it.</li>
<li> [...]Please note that Sonicare will protect your teeth and it is money well spent.</li>
<li> and I was not ready to start.</li>
<li> The charging stand is minimal</li>
<li> We ended up buying another brand of electronic toothbrush but still weren&#x27;t getting the results we expected.  </li>
<li> Sorry if I am confusing you more.</li>
<li> This is my second Elite, my other lasted 6 years of everyday use by two people.</li>
<li> The Extreme does not have a 30 sec warning, ...Not needed.  </li>
<li> This is an obvious location for moisture ingression, since when you stand the toothbrush upright, water will drip down to the little \\&quot;ledge\\&quot; formed in this location and pool there.  </li>
<li> This is an obvious location for moisture ingression, since when you stand the toothbrush upright, water will drip down to the little \\&quot;ledge\\&quot; formed in this location and pool there.  </li>
<li> The outside part of the toothbrush isn&#x27;t too difficult, but the inside that you can see when the head of the tootbrush is removed is ridiculous to clean.</li>
<li> THE OTHER HAS NOT ARRIVED YET AS OF FEBRUARY 23.</li>
<li> Travel case and other BS aside.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve read other people&#x27;s complaints about this on the internet</li>
<li> On the other hand, every time I brush this toothbrush makes my teeth feel like I just came from the dentist.</li>
<li> I hope other users write a review telling of this problem.</li>
<li> I just picked up The Extreme by Sonicare and it uses identical technology, with 2 AA batteries.  </li>
<li> Sonicare Elite seems softer and nicer than the other brands.  </li>
<li> and you only need to use a small amount of toothpaste per use.</li>
<li> a lot cheaper than Wal*Mart which are roughly around $23.00!</li>
<li> I agree with other reviews.  </li>
<li> Other than that</li>
<li> No more tennis elbow to get to the back teeth</li>
<li> There may be other electric toothbrushes out there that are &amp;quot;better&amp;quot; than the Sonicare Elite</li>
<li> And the other big plus for me is the fact that years and years of abusing my teeth and gums with a manual toothbrush (using excessive pressure)</li>
<li> Money well spent, in my opinion!</li>
<li> Therefore the sonicare brushes with the grain of your teeth while holding the brush horozontally, unlike any other brush on the market.</li>
<li> like I did with other brushes.  </li>
<li> (head a little larger and speed a little slower).</li>
<li> However, when I look at the evolution of power brushes, it is the other manufacturers who are chasing Sonicare.</li>
<li> /&gt;Oh, one other thing:  </li>
<li> I have never used any of the other \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; toothbrushes.</li>
<li> Granted, this may be in part due to the smaller/shorter bristles.  </li>
<li> I will not use any other toothbrush.  </li>
<li> Endlessly we sparred.   </li>
<li> but it&#x27;s not a pretty site.</li>
<li> When they arrived, while they were pretty difficult to get out of the packaging (use scissors)</li>
<li> There is a small palstic cap opposite the ON switch,kind of rectangular.  </li>
<li> Other than that, i would recommend this to anyone looking for a sonic brush.</li>
<li> This the third time we&#x27;ve purchased this product over the past six or seven years.</li>
<li> I have never had a cavity or any other sort of problems with my teeth</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for several years and my gum problems are no more.</li>
<li> and I think it is due to the difference in toothbrush design.      </li>
<li> My previous travel case was made of nylon, had some foam padding for protection, and closed with a wraparound zipper, which I think protects just as well and lasts longer.</li>
<li> Spent over $130.00 and the on-off switch died in less than one year.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s small enough to get to the back teeth and other hard to reach areas.  </li>
<li> It was a little expensive, but after brushing with it just once - I knew my teeth were miles cleaner right away.</li>
<li> It is almost impossible to get it into all the crevices to clean it thoroughly even with Qtips and other implements.</li>
<li> Humidity is the least of our worries and my house runs conistently drier than normal, particularly in the winter when it is cold</li>
<li> In addition, the noise of the Sonicare is less audible than other electric toothbrushes, so I don&#x27;t worry about waking up my roommates when I brush my teeth before bed.   </li>
<li> So whenever the battery&#x27;s strength finally fades, I hard after 1.5-2 years that it dies</li>
<li> Hopefully, the replacement toothbrush that I bought will last at least 6 months.</li>
<li> The only complaint I have is that they don&#x27;t make one in a travel size.</li>
<li> the Sonicare takes some getting used to for newbies because it may tickle and feel weird, but it has a ramp-up feature that gradually increases the speed during the first few uses.</li>
<li> With this toothbrush, it&#x27;s really difficult to apply a lot of pressure on the toothbrush because it&#x27;s already vibrating so much.</li>
<li> While the Elite also requires cleaning, it seems that the seal that separates the base of the head from the arm holding the bristles seals much better.</li>
<li> I shared my secret, the SonicCare, and my dentist was not at all surprised.  </li>
<li> But that&#x27;s not the most annoying problem.</li>
<li> This model has a hideous design where the saliva and other brushing liquids seep down into the inner mechanisms of the hand piece and pool up in a really disgusting way and requires you to take it apart and clean off inner crevices made up of metal and plastic parts.</li>
<li> And, I&#x27;m not real keen about having black mold 3 inches from my mouth, even if it is trapped inside the \\&quot;guts\\&quot; of the brush head and not on the brushes/stem itself.</li>
<li> We got two Sonicare toothbrushes on my dentists recommendation  a year ago because regualr brushing was wearing down my tooth enamel at the gum line.</li>
<li> The effect is the unit shuts off after about 30 seconds of use; holding down the on / off switch buys another 10 seconds or so; then 5 seconds; then nothing.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
<li> I like the thirty-second beeps and 2-minute shut down.</li>
<li> The second is I have bad insurance and its hard finding a dentist that takes it, or one that will clean and examine your teeth during one visit.</li>
<li> The only real drawback I&#x27;ve found is brushing my tongue - brushing it with the toothbrush on sprays toothpaste all over the bathroom, and brushing it with the toothbrush off (like an old fashioned manual toothbrush) is annoying because the toothbrush head is very small.  </li>
<li> Previously I used a Sonicare brush for two years before it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge any longer.</li>
<li> Previous to that</li>
<li> * BLACK MOLD -</li>
<li> Black mold residue stuff appeared where the toothbrush head goes.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s exactly (as a previous reviewer noted)</li>
<li> I also like that I can make my brushing sessions slightly longer as well.</li>
<li> Previously I&#x27;d been using the $6 Crest disposables, and I despise going to the dentist and having my gums bleed, so</li>
<li> There are newer versions for less.  </li>
<li> I purchased at the dentist a year and a half ago.  </li>
<li> Also, black \\&quot;moldy\\&quot; appearing deposits accumulate in the handle \\&quot;well\\&quot; which, also, never occured with the \\&quot;original\\&quot;.  </li>
<li> /&gt;2) if you currently have an \\&quot;original\\&quot; that is on its last legs then buy an Elite (again be wary of the rust)&lt;br /&gt;...</li>
<li> I got the 7300 because of the price - much less than the 7500.   </li>
<li> But I have no idea what is going on as I have had to replace 3 of these in less than 1 years time.</li>
<li> I bught them at my dentist for half the price</li>
<li> The gums DO NOT RECEDE because of the Sonicare: you still need to floss and remove plaque build up (but less thereoff); this point is made since some people seem to blame this technology for dental issues on here.</li>
<li> RS980 versions with the UV sanitizer and the design flaw has been corrected (plus replacement brush heads are half the price).</li>
<li> My previous visit to the dentist (in Nov 2007)</li>
<li> I also noticed some receded gums have now returned to their previous state.     </li>
<li> So beware, if you put your hard-earned dollars into this expensive product, it may only last three years and the manufacturer will not lift a finger to ensure you get the impression that this is just a buy and throw-away product.  </li>
<li> /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Since it is slightly after the 2 year warranty there would be no service.</li>
<li> He likes this one so well that all the others have been trashed and his professional dental cleanings are much less painful and less frequent.  </li>
<li> After around 18 months the battery took less and less of a charge until after around 26 months</li>
<li> the other hand, if you can fall asleep for days on end without brushing and emerge without a cavity or sore gums, you may get by with plain, old-fashioned brushing and flossing, even if you forget a time or two.</li>
<li> For is this not true:   </li>
<li> On my dentist&#x27;s recommendation, I purchased a 7300 about a year ago (at full price, ouch!), and I&#x27;ve never regretted it (even though I hate spending money).   </li>
<li> If bad teeth run in your family, you are prone to cavities or lax in your dental care, you absolutely need one of these and you will save hundreds of dollars in the long run.</li>
<li> Actually, I have no problem with this \\&quot;feature\\&quot; if some people are unable to figure out how to brush without a built-in timer as long as the company provides a way to turn the infernal thing off.</li>
<li> Needless to say, my gums are very sensitive.</li>
<li> Our battery powered $5 electric toothbrush produced no significant fields.</li>
<li> and the hygienist always comments on how little plaque there is.)</li>
<li> Lasted a little over a year.  </li>
<li> so it takes up little room on the sink.  </li>
<li> The handle has lots of little crevices where gunk can accumulate.</li>
<li> Obviously it is out of warranty, but this type of failure should not happen until past 5 years.  </li>
<li> The only bad things that I can say about it is that it does take a little getting used to at first, but now using a regular toothbrush feels weird to me.</li>
<li> A row of little, green LED&#x27;s tell you how charged the battery</li>
<li> The toothbrush is angled at the end making it easier to hold and to reach the tough spots in the back of your mouth.  </li>
<li> had a tough time deciding on the different Elite lines, because I didn&#x27;t find any helpful info on the difference between the models.  </li>
<li> It was also awkward, and I gave up and went back to a regular toothbrush.  </li>
<li> Another reviewer mentioned the mold, I can see how that could happen since there are a few areas that water and stuff could gather.</li>
<li> and unfortunately it can&#x27;t be disabled</li>
<li> Now my entire family uses Sonicare exclusively including my poor starving-student baby brother and my mother who has severe carpotunnel.  </li>
<li> You can&#x27;t see it if you never take off the head, but if you are frequently switching heads, it is extremely difficult NOT to notice.</li>
<li> About a year after I got it, the edge around the green power button on the handle began to crack.</li>
<li> Been using it for a few weeks.   </li>
<li> If you don&#x27;t have this tooth brush your missing out.&lt;br</li>
<li> Unlike few reviews where the battery lost its charge after few years, mine held charge for at-least 10 days even on the day it died.</li>
<li> After a few uses, I am operating on autopilot.</li>
<li> I have done this a few times.</li>
<li> I have the charger at the back of the sink behind the radio and out of the way.</li>
<li> If mine somehow got lost, stolen or broken, I&#x27;d have to buy another one the same day.  </li>
<li> I got used to this after a few days though.</li>
<li> The only problem is the \\&quot;desposits\\&quot; collected behind the brush and the handle.</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t help, still dead.  </li>
<li> The fact that I don&#x27;t have to waste money on batteries for my toothbrush since the Sonicare comes with a rechargeable battery is also an advantage.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
<li> Big problem if you travel a lot or when several people use the same base.  </li>
<li> I took mine without the charging base on a 4-day trip recently during which I shared it with a friend (i.e., 4 uses per day) and it lasted the whole trip</li>
<li> However, I&#x27;m afraid these modest improvements do not eclipse the serious problem noted above; namely, mold growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> However, I&#x27;m afraid these modest improvements do not eclipse the serious problem noted above; namely, mold growth.    </li>
<li> And the timer function sounds as though it would be infuriating, but it turns out to be useful; just don&#x27;t take it so seriously.</li>
<li> /&gt; Keeping the unit clean can be annoying because the well into which you screw on the head accumulates water which eventually starts to discolor and smell like mold/mildew.</li>
<li> If you don&#x27;t remove the brush head from the base after each use to clean the interior mold starts to build.  </li>
<li> Manual and rotary toothbrushes would sometimes hit a vulnerable nerve and cause major pain.</li>
<li> Once you use this technology a normal / manual toothbrush will make your mouth seem dirty after brushing</li>
<li> He says that it will close pockets and help end or effectively slow down the degerative process of bone loss.</li>
<li> This quickly causes a gunk build up in both the base of the brush head and the power unit.</li>
<li> The timer can be a little annoying when you&#x27;re exhausted and just want to brush as fast as possible, but that&#x27;s just me being lazy</li>
<li> After less than one year, the bottom began to disintegrate, possibly because of constant moisture in the charging base.</li>
<li> and there is very little moisture in the air and</li>
<li> I hope the new one lasts a while, because it was expensive!</li>
<li> I had an older model a while back, and hated the way it buzzed, and sprayed toothpaste all over the place.  </li>
<li> Problems &amp; pain in my teeth and are now things of the past.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m not confident it will alleviate the mold growth.  </li>
<li> and I&#x27;m not confident it will alleviate the mold growth.  </li>
<li> I disabled the gradual start feature (they tell you how!)</li>
<li> My teeth became noticeably whiter in not much more than a couple of weeks.  </li>
<li> This is for people who are either on the fence about which power toothbrush to buy or for those who think that power toothbrushes are for lazy people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
<li> Do they think I might leave it on or am too lazy to turn it off myself.</li>
<li> Be careful you don&#x27;t damage the Sonicare or your hands when wrestling with this devilish and unnecessary covering.</li>
<li> and they both failed the same way</li>
<li> It hasn&#x27;t failed yet only because I stopped using it.  </li>
<li> but I usually use two or three sessions each time brushing.</li>
<li> I was not sure of the culprit</li>
<li> I personally think it&#x27;s too expensive for a toothbrush.</li>
<li> a small foot print and the tooth brush already lasted a 3 day weekend at the ski hill without the charger.  </li>
<li> I have owned 4 Braun electric shavers over the past 24 years.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare for a bit over 10 years and never had any problems other than poor battery life.  </li>
<li> Since the price for the base systems is similar the savings from the toothbrushes for the Oral B is quite substantial, especially if several people are using the system.    </li>
<li> Worse, the base is too small, too light, and too shallow.</li>
<li> The removable brush head has areas that are really hard to get to.  </li>
<li> The kit includes a hard plastic case and a stand for a two additional brush heads.      </li>
<li> She was a hard sell</li>
<li> It seemed like I always had another little cavity somewhere, and to make things worse, there was the constant look of disappointment from my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I had to find a solution.</li>
<li> (I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s.)  </li>
<li> One reviewer complained about having to wait.</li>
<li> Our battery is dying at two years- seems to be a common problem.  </li>
<li> negative thing that i read was that the battery cannot be replaced.  </li>
<li> Lately, the duration has been shortened to 3 months while the cost of a pair has gone up about $5 a piece.  </li>
<li> I started using the Sonicare E7300 in late March of 2008.  </li>
<li> Another plus: The battery stays charged for at least 7 days, so for any trip shorter than a week, we would not even pack the charger.    </li>
<li> After using this model for a year, we were receiving negative feedback from our dental hygienist.  </li>
<li> I have had other electric toothbrushes where the batteries get corroded and the brush becomes useless, but the Sonicare has a sealed compartment of rechargeable batteries, so that is not a problem.</li>
<li> Maybe some Mean Time Before Failure? &lt;</li>
<li> With this unit, the base only holds the handle by about a half inch</li>
<li> We were sorely disappointed by the fact that the screw on brush heads were flimsy and didn&#x27;t screw down on the base unit securely.  </li>
<li> flows into the opening of the screw on brush heads and you will find a stinking slimy residue in there unless you take the head off every 2 days for a serious boiling.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s ridiculous.  </li>
<li> The brushheads are a little expensive</li>
<li> However, the above experience suggests they have some bad electronics or brush heads in the distribution</li>
<li> Two years ago, her gums were in such bad shape, she had been referred to a specialist.  </li>
<li> Not good.    </li>
<li> Not good.    </li>
<li> The Sonicare base is completely sealed and waterproof.  </li>
<li> But then my dental hygienist pointed out that it was also brushing away the base of my gums with its back-and-forth action</li>
<li> AND IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG THERE IS NO EASY WAY TO LET THEM KNOW THAT.</li>
<li> My dentist let me know that my tooth enamel was wearing away, since I was brushing too hard!</li>
<li> If you are the same you should go for a less expensive base model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> This is just lazy or careless design work.     </li>
<li> The travel case that comes with it is not very impressive.</li>
<li> but I no longer have to subject myself to the dreadful &#x27;deep cleaning&#x27;.</li>
<li> Ever since I started using it, the number of cavities and the amount of tartar and junk on my teeth has decreased, and has virtually been elimintated now.</li>
<li> There are [unnecessary?]</li>
<li> I think it may actually have to do with a rubber seal that is now placed around the base of the brush stem.  </li>
<li> Even though I floss every day, I still had plaque build-up behind my bottom front teeth with the Sonicare.  </li>
<li> Personally, I find the \\&quot;timer signal\\&quot; every 30 seconds annoying, too.</li>
<li> sometimes buy gadgets and get tired when their novelty wears off, but that hasn&#x27;t happened with the Sonicare</li>
<li> I have not experienced any of the problems mentioned here - but even if I did....</li>
<li> Upon calling the manufacturer, we were informed that the battery life should be 5 to 7 years; the warranty is only 2 years; the battery cannot be replaced and all we can do is throw away our still-functioning base and purchase a brand-new unit.  </li>
<li> I have stored it on the charging base, as directed, and only now is the battery showing its age.  </li>
<li> This is an awful high price for this product.  </li>
<li> Just plain bad quality.</li>
<li> We found the transfer of the ultra-sonic vibrations were dampened by the fact that the brush heads didn&#x27;t remain tightly connected to the base unit.  </li>
<li> but that&#x27;s a little annoying.  </li>
<li> I was skeptical of the sonic technology</li>
<li> Then, the switch randomly worked for electric problem inside.</li>
<li> now this brush seems useless to me.   </li>
<li> (The heads do get expensive)</li>
<li> I know weird</li>
<li> * Brush heads are expensive.</li>
<li> I was wrong.</li>
<li> It looks to me like it was designed to fail.     </li>
<li> (but be wary of the rusting problem)&lt;br</li>
<li> However, it is annoying if you like to brush your tongue like I do, because then you have to turn it on for another few seconds to do that</li>

<li> fail three times before I do   </li>
<li> With the risk of this reading like one of those fake &#x27;</li>

    <li> My hygienist recommended the Philips Sonicare toothbrush to me a while back, and am I ever glad I listened to her. It WORKS! I was lucky enough to get one (the e7300 model), for about $80 from Amazon back when it was being first introduced in 2008. Ever since I started using it, the number of cavities and the amount of tartar and junk on my teeth has decreased, and has virtually been elimintated now. Having some replacement brush heads makes a lot of sense too, doesn&#x27;t it? It does feel pretty weird to use it at first. It&#x27;s kind of tingly, but you do get used to it. My teeth have never been cleaner, and I don&#x27;t remember the last time I had a CAVITY-FREE checkup! Now, my last 3 checkups have been flawless. Problems &amp; pain in my teeth and are now things of the past. Those Dutch designers know their stuff! (&#x27;Philips&#x27; is a Netherlands based company). So do yourself a big favor and BUY ONE. Clean your teeth with SOUND WAVES! It&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
    <li> ORDERED TWO UNITS FROM AMAZON.COM OF THE SONICARE ELITE ON JANUARY 14. ONE ARRIVE PROMPTLY. THE OTHER HAS NOT ARRIVED YET AS OF FEBRUARY 23. I AM OBVIOUSLY DISSAPOINTED. I AM A REGULAR CUSTOMER OF AMAZON AND IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG THERE IS NO EASY WAY TO LET THEM KNOW THAT. MAY BE THEY WILL READ THIS COMMENT?&lt;BR&gt;AND SEND THE BRUSH. MY CREDIT CARD HAS BEEN CHARGED.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 of these for for my wife and I.  If I had noticed that there was a model 7500 with 2 power brushes I would have purchased that saving a lot.  The model is pricey, but works great and is easier to use than the previous heavier model.  One thing that I don&#x27;t like is that the battery is not replaceable.  We previously had the old model and when the battery ran down we had to throw the unit away (after recyling the battery of course).  You should be able to replace the rechargeable battery.    &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The unit is great though.</li>
    <li> I changed from my Braun Oral-B to the Sonicare Elite.  While it&#x27;s true, it does a great job of cleaning teeth, it&#x27;s a pain to keep clean.  The removable brush head has areas that are really hard to get to.  Even with a thorough cleaning after every use, it looks like \\&quot;scum\\&quot; builds up in the moving parts area of the brush head.  Look out bacteria and stuff.  I&#x27;m now trying to drop the brush head in &#x27;efferdent&#x27; weekly.  Seems to work - but who ever designed this thing, did not have cleanliness and convenience in mind!  I&#x27;ll be going back to a new Braun.</li>
    <li> This is my second Sonicare toothbrush. The travel case that comes with it is not very impressive. It&#x27;s a hard plastic with soft, bendable plastic serving as the hinge. It will protect your Sonic power handle and brush head, but I imagine the hinge will break after several uses. My previous travel case was made of nylon, had some foam padding for protection, and closed with a wraparound zipper, which I think protects just as well and lasts longer. The new plastic travel case is obviously cheaper to make and a money saver for Philips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like everything else about Sonicare. It does what it advertises, which is why I bought another after my first one ran out of battery.</li>
    <li> If you want, see my review of the last electric toothbrush I had. It died almost immediately after the nineteen month review. Have had this thing for approx nine months. It is much better. Travel case and other BS aside. It cost too much like everything thats worth a damn. Really, my dentist smiles when I go in. Of course, now that I think about it, I was like money in the bank before this thing. Maybe it&#x27;s a different kind of smile now.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a gift for Christmas 2006. Needless to say, the recipient is VERY impressed with the way it cleans her teeth. She had a different model by a different manufacturer and this one definitely works much better. The one drawback so far is that the travel case has a flimsy plastic latch on it that looks like it may only last a few times opening and closing. We will see. Overall, this is a very solid product with just the amount of bells and whistles and not a lot of \\&quot;extras\\&quot; that are not needed.</li>
    <li> Yeah it is a cliche but overall my mouth feels much better, I find it easier to brush for recommended length and really want to make sure I take care of my mouth.  I have noticed my boyfriend&#x27;s teeth look much better as well.  He was using another brand but this one really has improved his teeth.  He also seems to brush his teeth more with this one.</li>
    <li> Take it from me, this brush is worth the money.    Previously I used a Sonicare brush for two years before it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge any longer. After it died, I went back to a traditional brush. I just bought my new Sonicare and it works great.    My teeth feel smooth and my mouth feels refreshed. Kind of like when the dentist cleans your teeth.     But this toothbrush is better than my original:  1.) The barrel of the brush is smaller making it easier to hold.  2.) The toothbrush is angled at the end making it easier to hold and to reach the tough spots in the back of your mouth.  3.) What I really like it the battery charge level LEDs on the barrel. This way I always know how much charge I have left and don&#x27;t have to keep it on the charger all of the time. I think that is how I killed the battery last time after on two years.  4.) The 2 speed settings are nice, but I&#x27;ll never use them.    This brush is an \\&quot;Elite\\&quot; model. That means it&#x27;s in the top tier of Sonicare products. The tier below this is Essence. What I like about this model is that it&#x27;s the same price as their top-of-the-line Essence brush but it&#x27;s a better unit. It offers more features and it&#x27;s the same price, COOL!     Another reviewer mentioned the mold, I can see how that could happen since there are a few areas that water and stuff could gather. Just clean the brush before putting it away and you should be fine.    This is a great brush at a great price. Buy this one before any of the Essence models.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of the sonic technology but it really seems to work.  Your teeth really do feel like you just left the dentist.  The timer that tells you to change sections of your mouth is nice too.  The battery lasts long enough to take the brush with you on a two week trip.  I have no complaints about this product at all!</li>
    <li> I LOVE the way my teeth feel after using this toothbrush. But I&#x27;ve had it for over 6 months and the handle/base is disgusting. There are [unnecessary?] crevices in the handle where the brush head attaches and it&#x27;s a haven for bacteria and mold. Yep, mold is growing in the handle of my toothbrush. I&#x27;ve tried using rubbing alcohol and a cotton swab to clean it, but it&#x27;s still disgusting because nothing will fit into those tiny crevices. I&#x27;ve read other people&#x27;s complaints about this on the internet but I see no good cleaning methods suggested, and the Sonicare website makes it sound like it&#x27;s a breeze to clean once a week: \\&quot;Wipe away any residue you find, including the area covered by the cuff, with a soft cloth or paper towel. To clean your handle, run a damp cloth around the recessed area once a week.\\&quot; If it were only that easy.    On the other hand, every time I brush this toothbrush makes my teeth feel like I just came from the dentist. And I just had my first dentist appointment since using the Sonicare and cleaning my teeth was a breeze for the hygenist...barely any plaque to scrape off at all. (The prior appointment was an excrutiating 45 minutes of scraping and sore gums for days after.)    Please note that if you&#x27;re not used to using a powerful electric toothbrush, it will take you about 2 weeks to get fully used to this toothbrush. The first time will be a shock and you&#x27;ll wonder how brushing your teeth with that toothbrush could ever be pleasurable. But try it for 2 weeks before making a final decision.     I would have given this toothbrush 5 stars easily if it weren&#x27;t for the cleaning issue.</li>
    <li> I had heard a lot about the sonicare brush from dental hygienists and read a number of reviews before deciding to buy it.  I have to agree that it does an amazing job.  I bought an inexpensive electric toothbrush first just to see if I liked the idea compared with hand brushing, and was quite happy with it.  It did a good job, but the sonicare is in a league of it&#x27;s own.      The e7300 has a battery charge indicator which is useful if you don&#x27;t leave the brush on the charger all the time.  The rechargeable battery is a nicad and I believe they last longer if you don&#x27;t charge them continuously.  The instructions claim a charge will last for two weeks of use, but I&#x27;ve found eight or nine days (brushing twice per day) is about it.  This model has a 2 minute timer built-in and unfortunately it can&#x27;t be disabled - I find that the brush turns off before I&#x27;m finished brushing, but this is a minor annoyance.  The kit includes a hard plastic case and a stand for a two additional brush heads.      There is one significant downside which is that the battery cannot be replaced.  When it wears out apparently your only option is to discard the unit.  The instructions describe how to remove the battery so that it may be safely recycled, but that&#x27;s all.  Given the need to conserve resources and the considerable expense of the brush it is irresponsible to have to throw it away after a couple of years.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wait to go to the dentist so he can see what a wonderful difference it makes when using a great toothbrush system.  I don&#x27;t know why I waited this long before purchasing this.  Great product and it really cleans and whitens your teeth!</li>
    <li> This is my first electric toothbrush so i cant fairly compare it to other models, but i will say that my teeth feel and look much cleaner than they did when i was brushing manaully. My gum health has rapidly improved as well.     The brush is easily cleaned, reaches the back of the mouth easily, and is comfortable to use. The thirty second timer is a really helpful tool.     One downside of using an electric brush is the need to use a tongue scraper... I used to just brush my tongue, but that is not so easily done with this brush.</li>
    <li> I have owned my Elite model for about 6 months now.  Previous to that, I was the owner of the \\&quot;original\\&quot; Sonicare toothbrush for about 7 years, which used the standard heads rather than the angled \\&quot;elite\\&quot; brush heads.  I replaced it only because the non-user-replaceable battery finally gave up the ghost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, all the sonicare models do an outstanding job of keeping teeth cleaned, if used properly.  I like the sonic action better than rotary or slower-speed mechanical motion.  The sonicare keeps my teeth feeling polished.  The timer also forces me to brush for a full 2 minutes - 30 seconds for each quadrant of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As such, I am not going to spend a lot of time commenting on the effectiveness of the sonicare approach in general (which I think is excellent) or in comparing it to other brands.  Instead, I&#x27;m going to focus here strictly on comparing the new Elite model to the previous model which used so-called \\&quot;standard\\&quot; sonicare brush heads rather than \\&quot;elite\\&quot; brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, let&#x27;s talk about the relatively few things I like about the new model:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* battery indicator - shows when charging (which old one had) and shows how much charge remains (which old one did not have)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* styling - mine is blue/white and looks attractive with its rubberized side grips.  However, I have a sneaking suspicion the rubber is going to fade and look old more quickly than my older model which was entirely white plastic except for a single small on/off button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* charger - the new charger has open sides, unlike the old model which was a sealed \\&quot;well\\&quot; that would trap water and give rise to gunk build up.  The new design seems like it will stay cleaner and inhibit model or mildew...at least on the charger base itself&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* angled brush head - the angle of the \\&quot;elite\\&quot; design makes it easier to clean behind your teeth and is used even in most non-electric toothbrushes today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortuately, that is about it in terms of improvements.  The big black mark (and I do mean black literally) is that there is a significant problem with mold build-up on this design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* BLACK MOLD - On my old model, I never had a mold problem - ever.  Also, the mold problem is not a factor of my environment.  I live in Nevada.  Humidity is the least of our worries and my house runs conistently drier than normal, particularly in the winter when it is cold and there is very little moisture in the air and the forced-air furnace is running.  Many people have to use humidifiers (I don&#x27;t use one) to keep the house comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my old model, I never removed the brush heads except to change them and perhaps once a month to clean the built-up toothpaste that accumulated around the collar that secured the head to the handle.  I can honestly say that in 6+ years, there was never a hint of a mold problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the new model, however, I began to see the appearance of black mold within 2-4 weeks of purchase.  I think it may actually have to do with a rubber seal that is now placed around the base of the brush stem.  Water can seep in and remain trapped more easily than on the old model which had no opening at that location.  A sanitizer won&#x27;t help, either, because the location where the mold is growing is not likely to be exposed to the UV light in the charger.  It focuses on the brush stem and bristles, while the mold is in a sort of \\&quot;cavern\\&quot; that the light won&#x27;t reach.  In my opinion, the new model is a poor design and the company is going to have a significant problem until they redesign the brush heads and eliminate this rubber seal entirely, reverting back to a completely encapsulated design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Handle - my old handle was constructed entirely of plastic, with no rubberized sides.  Admittedly, the new sides make it easier to grip.  However, I don&#x27;t ever recall dropping my old handle because it was overly slippery and my old handle sayed nice and clean becauseit was entirely of smooth plastic.  After 6+ years the white had discolored to an unattractive dull yellow, but it had the important advantage of being able to keep clean.  Any white plastic is bound to discolor over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new design looks attractive now, with its accenting blue rubber sides; however, that rubber is very likely going to fade and discolor relatively quickly, unlike the previous model which took a very long time before it started to look shabby.  Also, toothpaste sticks to the rubber more readily than to the smooth plastic of the old model, making it slightly more difficult to keep clean.  Not a big deal, but worth noting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Handle seal - the handle&#x27;s cover has a very small gap around the circumference, right below the threads where the brush head attaches.  This is an obvious location for moisture ingression, since when you stand the toothbrush upright, water will drip down to the little \\&quot;ledge\\&quot; formed in this location and pool there.  The gap isn&#x27;t large, but is visible to the naked eye.  If I can see it, so can water molecules.  In time, I suspect this will spell a problem for the internals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the new model is more attractive, has a battery indicator, and the angled brush head is slightly easier to use.  However, I&#x27;m afraid these modest improvements do not eclipse the serious problem noted above; namely, mold growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never used to have to take my brush head off, except when toothpaste built up and actually started to inhibit the sonic vibration of the brush head.  Now, I&#x27;ve taken to removing the brush head after every use to allow everything to air dry properly.  It&#x27;s a bigger hassle and I&#x27;m not confident it will alleviate the mold growth.  After all, I think most people are like me and want to focus on maintaining their TEETH - not their toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, I&#x27;m not real keen about having black mold 3 inches from my mouth, even if it is trapped inside the \\&quot;guts\\&quot; of the brush head and not on the brushes/stem itself.dull yellow, but it had the important advantage of being able to keep clean.

    <li> I have used this product before and have had fantastic results with it! Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Upon my dentist&#x27;s recommendation, I bought a Sonicare toothbrush when I got braces more than 3 years ago.  (I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s.)  At the time the toothbrush was about $200.  This was a lot of money, but I agreed that if I was going to spend $6000 on braces another $200 would be worth it if it meant the fixed teeth wouldn&#x27;t be cavity ridden when the braces came off.  (Braces &#x3D; A LOT! of nooks for food build up &#x3D; cavities.)    After I started using the Sonicare, every time I went to the dental hygienist or ortho assistant (and these people were in different offices &amp; rotated, so the original recommending dentist was not getting a kick back) they could definitely tell the difference between my using a Sonicare vs. a regular brush (or a cheap electronic toothbrush knockoff).    I have had my braces off for more than a year (no post-braces cavities), and the dental hygienists still remark on what good health my teeth are in because of the Sonicare toothbrush I use.    Now my entire family uses Sonicare exclusively including my poor starving-student baby brother and my mother who has severe carpotunnel.  (She can handle the vibrations about 90% of the time, but the Sonicare is still much easier for her to use than a regular toothbrush--and definitely more effective.)    Consider a Sonicare an investment in your oral health and spend the money!  Even if you prevent only one cavity (which going by my family&#x27;s history, it absolutely does), the Sonicare will pay for itself!</li>
    <li> We first bought this toothbrush through our dentist and it seemed worth the price tag. Our whole family used the same toothbrush, thanks to the interchangeable heads. At first, the buzzing was VERY strong, which kind of made it funny to watch my sister get the giggles (if you are ticklish, WATCH OUT!) The toothbrush works well and keeps my teeth clean. It has two settings for power and has a sturdy design. But after a while, something gross appeared. Black mold residue stuff appeared where the toothbrush head goes. You can&#x27;t see it if you never take off the head, but if you are frequently switching heads, it is extremely difficult NOT to notice. The outside part of the toothbrush isn&#x27;t too difficult, but the inside that you can see when the head of the tootbrush is removed is ridiculous to clean. But, if you can get over your fear of that (it&#x27;s never hurt me!) then this is a good toothbrush and will keep your chompers squeaky clean!</li>
    <li> I got this product in 9/2008. It worked well but only for about a year. About a year after I got it, the edge around the green power button on the handle began to crack. Now the crack has almost made a complete circle around the button. All this time, it was still functional so I didn&#x27;t give it much thought about replacing it. Today it just died completely and it has not even been two years yet. My old Sonicare Essence lasted quite a few years without any glitch until the batteries would not hold charge any more. I would go back to the Essence but I am definitely not getting another fanicer model of Sonicare.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves her new Sonicare toothbrush.  Her dentist had recommended it, and I found it at a great price.</li>
    <li> I think this model has been discontinued.  Mine lasted about 5 years.  It seemed like a decent electric toothbrush except that crud would collect in the handle- gross.  The new FlexCare model solves this.    I would give the brush 4 stars except that it turns out Sonicare no longer sends you a postage-paid mailer to recycle the batteries.  I&#x27;d recycle them myself except they&#x27;re impossible to remove from the housing and I hurt my hand trying.  These older models use NiCad so they really should be recycled.</li>
    <li> I have been using the sonicare for several years and I should have notified everyone with the trouble with this unit at an earlier date. As far as getting a good brushing it is fantastic but it has a design flaw that I would have thought they would have fixed long ago.Everyone I know who has this toothbrush has had the rubber on off switch collapse into the unit. After my third sonicare I will not purchase another until that design weakness is remedied.I love the way it cleans my teeth and I will miss using it.I hope other users write a review telling of this problem. Sometimes there is strength in numbers.</li>
    <li> one year after my purchase, the top button made of rub wore away. so, water can flow into side! Then, the switch randomly worked for electric problem inside. I&#x27;d to seal the cleft on the button with tape, but no way to get back to normal function. now this brush seems useless to me.   Try to protect the button with particular care.</li>
    <li> Is It the best toothbrush? Only an independent lab would know, but by my experience of 4yrs with the original Sonicare has done wonders for my teeth! Recomended by my dentist, it has performed beyond my expectations. It really did clean as advertised. This was very important for me as I have a very painful form of neuropathy/nerve disease, so it hurts to hold or manipulate a regular toothbrush,Sonicare allows me to effectively clean my teeth and tongue.Yes you do need to clean the tongue, just don&#x27;t gag yourself.      My dentist had me coming in every 3mo for cleaning and that wasn&#x27;t getting it. Now I go once a year and there isn&#x27;t much to clean. It&#x27;s amazing the difference! My teeth stay whiter, my breath fresher and no sign of gum disease at 56 yo. Thats for a person who can&#x27;t hold a brush without pain.(Great for people with arthritis, MS, or kids who don&#x27;t understand how to brush.)      The timer is a great idea! One reviewer complained about having to wait. Just ask any dentist it takes that much time to adequatly message the gums, a very important part of brushing.      CAUTION: As with any electric brush, you can overbrush causing premature wear to the suface of your teeth. Erosion is the term used by dentist. So if you use any brush and your dentist remarks about erosion on exam, your over brushing. Back off on the pressure, it does not take much pressure to clean effectively with Sonicare.      If there is a better brush buy it, but my experience shows the original Sonicare works great! (The heads do get expensive)</li>
    <li> The toothbrush that came with the Sonicare Elite did not work properly after only 3 months.  The toothbrush vibrated very weakly yet made a very noisy rattling sound.  Hopefully, the replacement toothbrush that I bought will last at least 6 months.</li>
    <li> About 2 years ago, my dental hygenist recommended this toothbrush to me, and I didn&#x27;t buy it at the time, because I didn&#x27;t really want to spend that kind of money on a toothbrush. On a subsequent visit to my dentist for a cleaning, I was in so much pain when the hygenist was scraping the plaque and tartar off of my teeth, that I had tears rolling down my face, and she offered me novacane.  After that visit, I did a little more research into the Sonicare and based on all of the positive reviews from both dentists and patients, I decided to go ahead and buy one.  The next time I went to the dentist for a cleaning, I was in the chair for literally 5 minutes, and there was no pain at all!  The condition of my gums was so much improved and there was hardly any buildup of plaque or tartar.  I was very amazed.  When I told the hygenist that I had been using the Sonicare, she said that she could tell by the condition of my teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this toothbrush.  The only bad things that I can say about it is that it does take a little getting used to at first, but now using a regular toothbrush feels weird to me. Also, it is a little pricey, but doing a little bit comparison shopping to find a better price really pays off.  I bought mine originally from an Amazon Marketplace vendor, and I was able to get a great price, much lower than buying it in the store.  I&#x27;m planning on getting one for each of my parents as birthday gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really is a great toothbrush, and I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ve managed without it for so long!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a geek... and often find myself in love with the newest toy or gadget just to have my heart broken when it doesn&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;d had my eye on the Sonicares for almost two years when someone actually bought me one (\\&quot;Tired of hearing you talk about it\\&quot; was how I believe they put it) because as much as I wanted one, I couldn&#x27;t justify spending $120 on a toothbrush.  All I can say is \\&quot;wow!\\&quot;  I used to brush once a day (I know, bad me) and floss about once a week (bad me again...).  Now I&#x27;m using the Sonicare about three times a day because it&#x27;s JUST THAT GREAT.  When I&#x27;m finished brushing, my teeth feel brand new... it&#x27;s exactly (as a previous reviewer noted) like I&#x27;ve just gotten out of the dentist&#x27;s chair.  I never thought I&#x27;d be so verbose over a toothbrush, but these are phenomenal.  I&#x27;d recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush.  I does a wonderful job cleaning and makes my teeth appear whiter.  It is easy to use and easy to charge.  The only complaint I have is that they don&#x27;t make one in a travel size.</li>
    <li> I love this tootbrush.  I was skeptical at first, but after using it for one month I am very glad that I purchased it.  I can see a noticeable improvement in the color of my teeth and they feel so clean after use.  I recommend the Sonicare.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for only about 2 weeks now. It works great. My dentist recommended it as I have Periodontal disease (Gum disease ). He says that it will close pockets and help end or effectively slow down the degerative process of bone loss. This model has timer for 4 quaderants of the mouth; upper left/right, lower left/right. Designed to reach farther into the back of the mouth. Much better than the older models.</li>
    <li> First we purchased an e7300.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The timer did not work and the unit would turn itself off repeatedly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Called Sonicare who confirmed it did not work and I replaced it with an e5300.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The timer did not work and the unit would turn itself off repeatedly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Called Sonicare who confirmed it did not work and I took it back for a refund this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose these are good toothbrushes.  I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare for a bit over 10 years and never had any problems other than poor battery life.  However, the above experience suggests they have some bad electronics or brush heads in the distribution pipeline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or, now that Sonicare is owned by Phillips, quality has been compromised.  It certainly was in the last razor I purchased.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is different than the Braun I am used to, but my teeth seem cleaner.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used the Elite for the last two years.  My wife and I share the brush and it has done wonders on our teeth and gums.  Our battery is dying at two years- seems to be a common problem.  No fix.  I just picked up The Extreme by Sonicare and it uses identical technology, with 2 AA batteries.  for only 30 dollars?  It is for real and uses the same heads as the Elite.  The action is identical.  The Extreme does not have a 30 sec warning, ...Not needed.  I am unhappy with \\&quot;disposible products\\&quot;  I think the new Extreme should work well with rechargable AA.</li>
    <li> I had my first one for 3 years before I felt it was to gross and bought a new one, but it still worked!  Little pricey but worth the money</li>
    <li> My first one lasted 7 years and then the battery gave out. I really liked the QuadPacer feature and basically went looking for the cheapest model that had the QP. So I bought the e7300 (after much searching, Amazon had the best price). The e7300 is lighter and more comfortable than my old 5300, and I think it does a better job cleaning my teeth.    If you have never used a SonicCare, let me tell you what it is like. You know that feeling you get when have your teeth cleaned by the dentist? Imagine having that feeling every day. This is what SonicCare does. Need I say more?</li>
    <li> it is everything everyone says it is. it really works to take off plaque. My ten year old daughter who hates going to the dentist loves to use it! And I have had no problems with the battery holding charge.</li>
    <li> The Sonicare system has given me back my tooth enamel. After my first generation Sonicare unit stopped working, I decided to go back to a manual toothbrush, since I didn&#x27;t want the expense of a new Sonicare. My dentist let me know that my tooth enamel was wearing away, since I was brushing too hard! He recommended the Philips Sonicare. I decided to purchase the Elite series and my teeth are already feeling cleaner and looking healthier.  I like the improvements with the LED display, the newer contoured brushes, and the power and speed of the unit.  Wish we had had this in the early 60&#x27;s when I was growing up. I believe my teeth would have benefitted immensely.</li>
    <li> I had this product for the pass 2.5 years and guess what, the brush is very weak compare the how it was originally since the battery is older. But after a change, the 1st and the 2nd brush is still great. Now I got that out of the way, I love this brush, its like coming out of the dentist after a teeth clean.    Pluses: Way powerful brush initially. Clean teeth feels great.    Minuses: Battery life will diminish over time as well as power... :( also the brushes are very expensive. So buy them in bulk and save.    only if I can replace the battery for like 20$ I would give it a 5 star.  Also</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush! I received one as a gift and bought one a year later as a gift for my mom.  My teeth feel really clean after each use (as compared to a manual brush) and it stays charged for a long time. It didn&#x27;t take long to get used to the power of the brush since it will build up the intensity over a week or 2 for easier transition from manual to powered brush.     Make sure to use the travel case it comes with if you plan to take it on overnight trips. If you leave the toothbrush together during travel, the brush head may get bent resulting in the toothbrush making a very loud rattling sound when in use. Also, if you are using a whitening toothpaste put a towel over your chest and shoulder until you get used to the feel of the brush. Otherwise, you may end up with discoloration on your shirt from toothpaste splatter.</li>
    <li> It was recommended by our dentist.  Sonicare Elite seems softer and nicer than the other brands.  We like it.</li>
    <li> It took me a long time to make the switch from a regular toothbrush to an electric one.  I had tried the Crest spin brush before.  You know the one, you put in a couple of AA batteries and it supposedly gives you a great clean.  Well, it&#x27;s crap.  It&#x27;s not waterproof, so eventually the batteries get wet and that just makes a big mess.  But I digress.  I received my Sonicare by mail after ordering it from Amazon.  I got a killer deal (50 percent off regular price), so that really influenced my decision.  However, I also have sensitive gums and my dentist had been recommending one of these for a while.  I charged it up and started to use it. And my teeth have never felt cleaner!  The Sonicare e7300 has a digital battery display, as well as a 2-minute timer that lets you know every 30 seconds that you need to move on to a different area.  I never timed my brushing before, but I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s the best way to keep your teeth healthy.  I had excellent oral hygiene before.  Now, I&#x27;ve reached the pinnacle with my Sonicare.    I mentioned before the problem with lesser electric toothbrushes.  The Sonicare base is completely sealed and waterproof.  I&#x27;ve had mine for a little over a month now and decided to see if the promise that it&#x27;s dishwasher safe was true.  Sure enough, I ran it (the base, not the brush) through a dish cycle last night.  It works just fine, and my toothbrush looks brand new.  I recommend this product to everyone.  Two minor complaints are the noise it makes (it&#x27;s a high-pitched whine, but if you know physics, you know vibration through a medium produces sound) and battery life.  It says you get two weeks&#x27; use out of one charge, to make it easy to travel with it.  I get about 12 days out of one charge.  Not too far off the mark, but that&#x27;s a little annoying.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s perfect!  Pick one up today.  You&#x27;ll have a dentist clean feeling twice a day, without all the poking and prodding.</li>
    <li> I love the toothbrush, although it does have a strong buzzing vibration to it.    One day I was measuring electro-magnetic fields using the \\&quot;Extech 480823\\&quot; meter, which I bought from Amazon.  I was surprised that the Sonicare Elite&#x27;s reading was OFF THE CHART, producing over 200 milligauss.  I have no idea if this is dangerous, but it&#x27;s more than 10x stronger than a hair dryer -- and it&#x27;s right next to your head.    I would like to know if the Braun Oral B is similar.  Can anyone take a measurement?  Our battery powered $5 electric toothbrush produced no significant fields.</li>
    <li> The Sonicare e7300 is great. It does a better job with brushing than a manual toothbrush. It certainly helps with plaque control. This is a good investment.</li>
    <li> works great, teeth feel cleaner than with a regular tooth brush. i can also see a difference after using the sonicare, my teeth are noticably whiter.</li>
    <li> This is my second sonicare I have purchased.  I really like the smaller handle with the rubber sides.  I like the thinner toothbrush and the 30-second timer in this new model.  The light indicates how much battery life is remaining.  Very pleased with my new sonicare and all the improvements since my older version.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this toothbrush!!  Like everything else, take care of it and keep it clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for about 6 months now and it has made my teeth feel fresh and polished after every use.  it&#x27;s also very easy to take apart for road trips. The small brushhead is great for getign around to your back teeth and you only need to use a small amount of toothpaste per use. &lt;br /&gt;One negative thing that i read was that the battery cannot be replaced.  So whenever the battery&#x27;s strength finally fades, I hard after 1.5-2 years that it dies and you have to buy a whole new toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I bought my Sonicare Elite a couple of months ago &amp;amp; am very satisfied with the results. My teeth feel so clean &amp;amp; my gums are getting more pink. I have braces &amp;amp; I want to tell you that my Sonicare does not harm them in any way, infact I found it easier to brush with my Sonicare than the manual toothbrush I was using. By it you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!&lt;br /&gt;P.S. You can by the Sonicare Elite replacement heads at Amazon.com for only $19.99 (and that&#x27;s for two) a lot cheaper than Wal*Mart which are roughly around $23.00!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an engineer, and this may be the most beautiful machine I&#x27;ve ever seen. The handle is permanently, hermetically sealed. The head has what appear to be magnets at the end of some good-sized struts, and apparently the electronics generate an oscillating magnetic field right through the plastic to shake them. But we&#x27;re not talking wimpy here. I disabled the gradual start feature (they tell you how!) to see what I was getting into, and you&#x27;ve got to do this just right or the tickling of your lips will be unbearable. I think I&#x27;m getting the hang of it, and I rather like the brushing action. Anyway, charging is apparently also by transformer action right through the plastic. Just a fabulous design. And the timer function sounds as though it would be infuriating, but it turns out to be useful; just don&#x27;t take it so seriously. One caution, though: As I recall, when I stopped brushing long ago and got 9 cavities, several were on the chewing surfaces, so best to hit those too.&lt;br /&gt;[Months later] The tickling is strictly a temporary problem. It hasn&#x27;t been happening at all for a long time. This is a very nice product. And were you wondering how it beeps? Well, there&#x27;s enough of a sounding board in it that the vibration makes sound waves, so some genius figured, hey, just switch to a much higher vibration rate of the main mechanism, and that&#x27;s a beep. All still hermetically sealed.</li>
    <li> We have used Sonicare Power Toothbrushes for a number of years and have found them to be an excellent product.  The brushing action of the Elite series is an improvement over the older models.</li>
    <li> In December I had a series of gum grafts done on my upper and lower gums. (ouch!) Needless to say, my gums are very sensitive. The Sonicare Elite is a great solution. I have been using the toothbrush for a month now and I am very pleased. The brush head is small enough that I can get a very thorough brushing without causing harm to my gums, and the quadpacer feature is a helpful reminder to brush for 2 full minutes. It was a little more than I wanted to spend on a toohbrush, but with the gums my mother gave me, I know its a worthy investment and will likely decrease my future dentist bills.</li>
    <li> My dental hygenist recommended Sonicare Elite because I was brushing too vigorously and making my gums receed. No matter what toothbrush or paste, including straight baking soda, I tried, they never felt clean enough.  I took her advice and got one that day.  WOW!  I couldn&#x27;t believe how clean my teeth were after 2 minutes.  They stay clean much longer and my gums are no longer getting scrubbed too hard.  Sonicare is so gentle on your gums and just glides over your teeth.  I got a pack of extra heads and my husband tried it and said his teeth felt as clean as leaving the dentist.  The extra heads are not what I thought they would be like.  You get the collers that screw on the main unit, not just the toothbrush head.  That&#x27;s kindof nice for hygenical purposes though. I agree with other reviews.  You probably will still need a way to brush your tongue.  Sonicare just doesn&#x27;t seem to work for that.  Overall a major improvement over any other toothbrush!  I really think it will save money on dental work in the future.</li>
    <li> I was instructed to get a sonic care by my dentist.  Found the best price on amazon.  This model is excellent.  Stays charged for weeks and brushes so much better that the Crest battery brush I was using.  Had it for several months now and still very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have been extremely impressed with my Sonicare Elite, which I bought one month ago. I knew an electric toothbrush would make a significant difference my dental health, but my teeth look and feel much cleaner than I expected.    What most impresses me about the Sonicare, however, is how well thought out the design is (no doubt thanks to numerous preceeding trial and errors). I had tried older versions of this product a few years ago and found them awkward, but this model is truly comfortable to use. I can actually get to all of my teeth at all angles easily. I also like that I can make my brushing sessions slightly longer as well. And it is surprisingly portable-- I travel a lot, so this is a big plus for me.    The reviewers who complain about the product being difficult to clean or about grime or build-up under the nut probably did not read the instruction manual. The instructions specify how to clean under the nut easily (the brush head pops out). I&#x27;m a bit neurotic about cleanliness myself, and I have found it to be very easy to clean and quite sanitary.    All in all, I&#x27;m a convert.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my wife.  She wore out her Sonicare.  So for she has been happy with this one.  Her first concern was that the brush was smaller than her prior model.  So far she has not been concerned.  Amazon was as fast an efficent as always and their price was the best. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I do feel like my teeth are cleaned better used this toothbrush than anything I&#x27;ve every tried outside a dentist&#x27;s cleaning, but it&#x27;s a pretty expensive option for a toothbrush.</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;m writing to review the 7300, mine was a much older version.  After 14 years, my sonicare has finally gone off to the great dentist in the sky. While this brush may seem expensive, factor in 14 years of use and the cleanest teeth ever, and it really becomes a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to start shopping for a new one.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brush for over 3 years and my dental checkups have been great and I noticed whiter teeth after using for 3-4 months.  My only problem with the brush is that the battery died after 3 years and I had to buy another one as there was no way to replace the battery.  Other than that a great product that does what it says it does.</li>
    <li> Love both of the Sonicares.  Still have the older version.  With the new one is so much easier to reach the back teeth.</li>
    <li> I used the Sonicare Elite for several years, buying the hype that it was cleaning my teeth better than I could.  But then my dental hygienist pointed out that it was also brushing away the base of my gums with its back-and-forth action--she showed me the linear ridges it has made in my gums.  I don&#x27;t apply alot of pressure when brushing, so this was upsetting, especially since the damage is permanent.  She&#x27;d been trying to get me to switch to the Oral B for ages, so when my sister-in-law (also a hygienist) recommended the Oral B, I went out and got one.  The circular action doesn&#x27;t wear away the gum line, and my teeth are significantly cleaner.  Even though I floss every day, I still had plaque build-up behind my bottom front teeth with the Sonicare.  With the Oral B, it&#x27;s gone.  And with the variety of brushing styles that automatically switch when you change a brush head (several options are included!), it&#x27;s a lot more bang for your buck.</li>
    <li> Big fan of the Sonicare - it has helped my teeth and gum health return to excellent.  I had the original type for about 6 years - maybe it had gotten weak or maybe there is a difference, but this new one is really strong.  It took me a couple of months to get used to the increased intensity of this brush. It does have a way to reduce the intensity and I did reduce the power on it for about 2 months, but am used to it now.   I really do like the thinner neck and would buy again.</li>
    <li> We have used this brand of electric toothbrush for several years.  Our old one \\&quot;died\\&quot; and we had to order another one in a hurry.  The shipping was fast and ordering was easy.  We can&#x27;t live without our electric toothbrush and would urge everyone to buy this brand.</li>
    <li> Love this product, I am so glad that I listened to my dentist and ordered this product.</li>
    <li> Been using it for a few weeks.   Easy on gums, gets teeth clean.   I think it&#x27;s even getting them whiter than when i used a regular toothbrush.  But I could be imagining things of course, seeing how I fantasize about everything.  In fact, my teeth could be getting dirtier and discolored, but in my head, I might be thinking the opposite.   You know the theories how everyone&#x27;s perception of reality is different.  So there, maybe that is at play here. But overall, good toothbrush, worth the money.   I won&#x27;t be giving you all any more updates, unless all of my teeth fall out due to the usage of this product.</li>
    <li> This purchase was to replace a toothbrush that died after 6-7 years.  It is a great toothbrush and the Amazon offered agreat price.</li>
    <li> Philips Sonicare Elite has been my favorite power toothbrush for over 10 years now.  This Elite e7300 was actually my second -- yes, the first one lasted 10 years! The mark of a great product is when you can answer \\&quot;Yes\\&quot; to the question \\&quot;Would I buy it again?\\&quot;.  In this case, I did to both.    All the dentists that I know have recommended the Sonicare.  More important than just cleaning your teeth, it helps maintain healthy gums.  As you get older you realize how really important that is!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for three years and it cleans well. But I have to question the price at $9,999.00. But then again, clean teeth are priceless.    Don&#x27;t forget to floss! (daily)</li>
    <li> I LOVE this tooth brush. Absolutely leaves your mouth feeling fresh and massaged. I have always loved to brush my teeth. I know weird huh. Weird is good. I will never go back to a regular toothbrush now that I have this.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are cleaner, fresher, and even whiter. I can rave on and on about the benefits of this tooth brush but I will limit it to the following:&lt;br /&gt;*  flossing is easier since using this tooth brush cleans better than the manual ones ( gross I know but much less gunk )&lt;br /&gt;*  My teeth feel polished and are whiter&lt;br /&gt;*  breath stays fresher longer ( may be just me but it is fresher longer)&lt;br /&gt;*  Don&#x27;t have to wonder if you brushed long enough it brushes for 2 minutes and cuts off (mindless fun)&lt;br /&gt;*  No more tennis elbow to get to the back teeth, this brush gently cleans the backs with minimum motion on your part.&lt;br /&gt;*  You will tongue your teeth more because they will feel smooth and polished.&lt;br /&gt;Okay that&#x27;s about it. If you don&#x27;t have this tooth brush your missing out.&lt;br /&gt;PS I used to brush with baking soda and peroxide (dip brush in peroxide and then baking soda) once a week to keep my teeth stain free and white. Now I do it once a month. It tastes bad but your mouth will feel luxurious.</li>
    <li> There may be other electric toothbrushes out there that are &amp;quot;better&amp;quot; than the Sonicare Elite but I will say, with no reservations, that this is the absolute best toothbrush I have ever used. I thought those simple little rotary toothbrushes were pretty nifty when they came out but they were not truly up to the challenge of getting my teeth really clean and stain-free. Based on positive reviews and a tempting Gold Box offer, I gave the Sonicare Elite a chance. The best dental investment I have ever made! Yes, it will tickle at first when you just start using it but the brush actually ramps itself up over the first ten or so (forget the exact number) uses to allow you time to get accustomed to it. The tickle factor was only the first couple of uses and then it moved past that - but try to avoid hitting your teeth with the plastic part because you&#x27;ll feel the vibrations right through your skull. The stains that were developing immediately began to disappear and my teeth looked much whiter and felt wonderfully clean in just a couple of weeks without any &amp;quot;extra whitening&amp;quot; toothpaste. The improvement was pure Sonicare. Other things I love about it is the fact that it indicates when it is time to switch quadrants. I found that not only am I spending the proper time brushing my teeth now (without overdoing it) but this feature also keeps me more mindful of HOW I&#x27;m brushing my teeth. The timer effortlessly helps you be more consistent in your brushing behavior. And the other big plus for me is the fact that years and years of abusing my teeth and gums with a manual toothbrush (using excessive pressure) has caused my gums to erode under some of my teeth. Manual and rotary toothbrushes would sometimes hit a vulnerable nerve and cause major pain. I feared that would happen with the Sonicare but for some reason the Elite has never caused me any discomfort. A single charge lasts many sessions and the unit simply drops into its charger as simple and sweet as you&#x27;d ever want. The head is compact and the neck is slender so it gets into the tighter areas with ease. My brushing sessions are now more consistent and pain-free and my teeth are noticeably whiter and they feel exceptionally clean. Money well spent, in my opinion!</li>
    <li> Never thought I&#x27;d say this about a toothbrush, but the Sonicare Elite has got to be one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.  I had always thought that it was just a gadget made for people who had too much money or who simply had to have the latest electronic gadgets.  Boy was I wrong!  On my dentist&#x27;s recommendation, I purchased a 7300 about a year ago (at full price, ouch!), and I&#x27;ve never regretted it (even though I hate spending money).   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;12 months later, I still marvel at how smooth and clean my teeth feel after each brushing.  At my last 6-month checkup, my dentist literally exclaimed with joy at the lack of tartar build up, and the cleaning itself was a breeze.  She also commented that I must have used my followup Zoom! application at home because my teeth were still a bright white almost a year after the in office Zoom! treatment.  But no, the continued whiteness is just from regularly using the Sonicare Elite toothbrush (with Crest&#x27;s Rejeuvenating Effects toothpaste, if anyone is interested).   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, I no longer have any gum bleeding or soreness, my gum lines have stopped receding, and heck, it even helped eliminate some causes of bad breath to boot!  (Not saying I had bad breath, mind you... :)  But, of course, the main reason to get the Elite is because it will make your teeth cleaner and healthier than they&#x27;ve ever been before. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No, I&#x27;ll never go back to a manual toothbrush.  Even though it&#x27;s pricey, the Sonicare Elite is easily worth it.  If you care about your teeth and want to keep them for the rest of your life, get the Sonicare Elite.  I imagine the 7500 will give you similar results to the 7300, so it just comes down to deciding whether or not to spend the extra bucks for some cute lights.  Personally, I don&#x27;t think the LEDs are worth it.  Go with the 7300, and you&#x27;ll never look back.  Just make sure to clean it as per the maintenance instructions and you&#x27;ll be happy with it.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush does a fair job when the brush heads are new; however, they get \\&quot;mushy\\&quot; rather quickly and at $12.50 each you will go broke replacing them! I have purchased a Braun Oral-B Triumph to replace it and it has been a much more economical alternative and functions just as well, if not better.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this product since I had some gum recession.  As an extra bonus to helping my gums, my teeth are definitely whiter and shine after brushing.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.  It is very expensive as are the replacement heads.  The only complaint I have is that when you replace the toothbrush in the charger, it must be seated precisely to charge, otherwise it keeps blinking causing you to return to make sure it&#x27;s seated correctly.  You&#x27;d think that this task could have been made easier with all the technology available.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Model after reading reviews about the various models and have been very happy with the purchase.  It does an exceptional job of cleaning the backs of the teeth and well as the front surfaces.  I recently went to the dentist for my 6 mo. checkup and they had the same model sitting on their counter to recommend to their patients.  The hygenist gave me a high score on my dental hygiene.  We now own 3 of these toothbrushes.  I bought the model which comes with 2 heads for my husband and myself and the single head model for my daughter and one for my son who is away at college.  I can&#x27;t think of any drawbacks to this model.  I like the timer and I like the slim head which is easy to maneuver around the teeth.  It stays charged for around 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I bought this in October for 136 dollars and I feel it has been worth the money thus far.  Now to see the same model for 100, anyone who is unsure whether or not it&#x27;s a good investment, I assure you, you will enjoy brushing your teeth.  As others have said, your teeth truely feel like you came from the dentist, and it is very gentle on your gums.  My dentist was impressed and I boasted about my sonicare.  The hygenist who works with her instantly remarked at how much she loved her sonicare.  Someone in another review remarked that you can&#x27;t brush your tongue with it, but if you really stiffen your tounge out it cleans it completely, much more efficiently than a manual brush or tongue scraper.  If you&#x27;re wondering how it works, an electromagnet in the handle causes two magnets on the end of the brush head to twist the metal shaft in the brush head back and fourth tens of thousands of times per minute.  Therefore the sonicare brushes with the grain of your teeth while holding the brush horozontally, unlike any other brush on the market.</li>
    <li> Previously I&#x27;d been using the $6 Crest disposables, and I despise going to the dentist and having my gums bleed, so I LOVE this toothbrush. &lt;br /&gt;I never get the buildup on the inside of my front teeth like I did with other brushes.  Every day is dentist-clean.  If you can afford it - get one.</li>
    <li> This is an awful high price for this product.  There are newer versions for less.  Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> This product works exactly as my dentist said it would.  I&#x27;m very glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Teeth feel a great deal cleaner and it charges and cleans up very easily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Sonicare toothbrush of one kind or another for many years. My dentist has said that it has made a major difference in the amount of plaque, etc. (Used to have to have my teeth cleaned every 3 months -- now I do it every 6 months and the hygienist always comments on how little plaque there is.) I use the Elite model for travel, but still use my Advance model for everyday cleaning and actually like it better (head a little larger and speed a little slower).</li>
    <li> I have this for over a year and it is a great purchase.</li>
    <li> It has been about a month now with the new electric toothbrush and I admit that I prefer it quite a bit to the old manual one.  My teeth became noticeably whiter in not much more than a couple of weeks.  My gums feel better and the massage you can give them with this toothbrush is quite a treat.  Some of the downsides include a battery that is not replaceable (a NiCd battery which unfortunately can suffer from the memory effect if not charged correctly), it doesn&#x27;t circulate toothpaste around the mouth as well for that clean fresh breath, and I suppose it is a little on the pricey side.  I am, however, happy that I finally got one and I don&#x27;t in any way regret the purchase.</li>
    <li> This item is just as my dentist described.  After brushing for the programmed 2 minutes, your teeth feel very clean and refreshed.  Very easy to use, maintain and keep clean.  I will never go back to a manual toothbrush again.  My dentist recommended sonicare because I was not getting my gumline top and bottom clean enough, and cavities were starting to form.  This is the first sonicare I have owned but it will definitely not be my last.  It stays charged for about 2 weeks also which is great.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Sonicare Elite for my daughter who, at the time, was having periodontal problems.  She loves the Elite and although she did eventually have gum surgery, her periodontal problems actually improved prior to the surgery.</li>
    <li> I love my Sonicare e7300.  Everytime I use it, my mouth feels like I just left the dentist (minus the pain and lectures on tooth decay).  Battery life is about a week per charge, and takes 12-14 hours to recharge fully.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a replacement for a Sonicare Standard that lasted eight years. Great product. Wouldn&#x27;t brush my teeth with anything else.</li>
    <li> The Sonic Care makes my teeth feel so clean!  It really does a great job cleaning and without damaging my gums.</li>
    <li> This is the third Soniccare tooth system in our household.  The e system Soniccare makes your teeth and gums tingle.  I wuold tell anyone I know to try a Soniccare toothbrush for the best mouth care there is.</li>
    <li> Manual brushing can&#x27;t achieve so many strokes/minute like the sonic type brushes. The result is they really work better than manual (just my experimental observation) - teeth are cleaner yet not as clean and smooth as after dental cleaning despite the marketing claims. Don&#x27;t delude yourself - sonic brushes can&#x27;t clean between the teeth despite the fantastic marketing claims about the &#x27;ultrasonic technology&#x27; lol. You will need flosing, interdental brushes or better water jet for that. Sonic vibrating brushes are gentler on the gums compared to the rotating brushes.    After using the sonicare brush for a month, I&#x27;ve replaced it with the CVS sonic brush which to my opinion cleans better - bigger brush and better contact with teeth. The only &#x27;advantages&#x27; of sonicare is that its timer beeps every 30 seconds while the CVS timer just turns off the brush after 2 minutes of brushing (you can start it again to continue brushing) and sonicare has a charge indicator while CVS hasn&#x27;t. The biggest advantage of CVS is the significantly lower price for the unit, which includes the charger, a UV sanitizer and 3 brush heads. The replacement CVS brush heads are way cheaper than the sonicare ones which appparently are made of gold, otherwise I can&#x27;t understand why I am expected to pay $25-$35 for two plastic brush heads LOL     The thing I don&#x27;t like about both sonicare and CVS brushes is that they don&#x27;t use regular rechargable batteries so when their battery dies in a few years you will have to throw away the whole unit and get a new one.</li>
    <li> Very good toothbrush, heads hold up well from use and I think it does a better job cleaning my teeth than the Oral-B I used before buying this product.</li>
    <li> After cleaning my teeth for almost 4 years and 8 months, my sonicare Elite 7300 buzzed its last vibe yesterday. The battery did not die on me, but the rubber button that covers the power switch developed a tear and thus allowing water into the chamber where the electronics reside. Unlike few reviews where the battery lost its charge after few years, mine held charge for at-least 10 days even on the day it died. Thats because of the fact that I charged and drained the battery completely on the initial charge and continued to do so once every couple of months or so.    While its a great product, i had few issues with this brush:    * The brush head cavity can fill up with water and gunk and can harbor bacteria unless its cleaned every week. More frequently if you brush while in the shower.  * While operating in the tooth brush for a couple of month abroad, the magnet in the brush head fell off.   * Brush heads are expensive. When i bought the brush, the cost of a pair was around $20 and they were supposed to last for 6 months. Lately, the duration has been shortened to 3 months while the cost of a pair has gone up about $5 a piece.  * The brush heads were made of plastic, metal, rubber and magnets. Made me feel so-not-green while throwing them away.   * The charger is only 110V and can be a trouble when traveling outside US.    Even with all these shortcomings, elite 7300 is a great dental hygiene product that was way better than manual brushing. I would buy this product in a heartbeat, but the newer [[ASIN:B0013TVEWA Philips Sonicare Flexcare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush]] series seems to solve most of the issues that I faced with the elite series. So, if you are on a moderate budget for a squeaky clean teeth and don&#x27;t mind shelling out a couple of \\&quot;jacksons\\&quot; a year for brush heads, this is the tooth brush you need to get.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd Sonicare I&#x27;ve owned over the last several years. The others worked fine but eventually the batterys started to wear out so I&#x27;d buy another. This one is the best so far. This one gives you all you could ask for in the basics without getting any fancy up-grades. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have been a Sonicare fan for many years. recently my old model died, refusing to take a charge after about 13 years.  The new style, bent head and shaped brush, seems even better.  Worth the update even if your old style is still working!</li>
    <li> I had an old Sonicare for almost 5 years and the battery ... out on me, so I decided to get a new one.  I didn&#x27;t know about the Elite until I went to buy it.  I&#x27;ve had it for almost a week and it is defintely better than my old one.  &lt;br /&gt;My old Sonicare did not have the Quad Pacer feature which this does and I like it a lot.  I also really like the new thin, angled brush head and I believe the claims that the Elite is 20% more effective than older models.  My teeth almost feel like I just had them polished after brushing.  If you are looking to replace your old one or want to get an powered toothbrush I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I only noticed very little difference in using this sonicare model and my old manual toothbrush...not enough to run out and spend $100.00 on another bursh next time.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons:  1.) Toothbrush is quite noisy. &lt;br /&gt;2.) Don&#x27;t toss your manual toothbrush away, the Ni-Cd battery in this sonicare handle takes 24 hrs. for a full charge!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll keep this short. This is for people who are either on the fence about which power toothbrush to buy or for those who think that power toothbrushes are for lazy people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can only appreciate how much cleaner your teeth are and how much better your gums feel by using this device. This review cannot do it justice. Suffice it to say that I too used to think that the old-fashioned brush was all I ever needed. I was wrong. Your teeth will be cleaner and your gums will be healthier. You will actually enjoy brushing your teeth - look forward to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should disclose that as power toothbushes go, I have only ever used Sonicare, and started with the original design. It finally pooped out after many years of use and several hard falls onto my ceramic tile bathroom floor. This new unit is even better than the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have no experience with others, I cannot tell you unequivocally that Sonicare&#x27;s better than its competitors.  However, when I look at the evolution of power brushes, it is the other manufacturers who are chasing Sonicare. I would also say that it is simply hard for me to believe any brush could work better or feel better than the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get one. You need it. You can always return it if you don&#x27;t like it, right? I promise you won&#x27;t want to.</li>
    <li> I had one of the older Sonicare models before the Elite came out.  Great toothbrush.  In fact I never would have thought of upgrading except for the fact that I was doing lots of traveling and the older models didn&#x27;t keep their charge very long.   I am really glad I made the change.  All of the Sonicare toothbrushes apparently have better batteries now.  I have taken my Elite for trips in excess of two weeks, using it twice most days.  There are, however, lots of other features which make this a better brush.  Most importantly is the size and shape of the head.  The original Sonicare and the current Advance models have a large head which extends straight from the main body of the toothbrush.  The Elite series has a smaller head and comes off of the body of the brush at a more ergonomically functional angle.  Smaller is better in terms of doing a good job of cleaning. The first time I used my old Sonicare I was amazed.  I had a similar reaction when I upgraded to the Elite.  It does a much better job at getting into small spaces and cleaning back teeth. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Another nice feature is that it is less messy than my older model.  If you don&#x27;t clean the underside of the head on older models, they get pretty gross very quickly.  While the Elite also requires cleaning, it seems that the seal that separates the base of the head from the arm holding the bristles seals much better. Definitely a cleaner medicine cabinet.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One hundred dollars seems like a lot for a toothbrush.  However, given how this brush really saves teeth and preserves their attractiveness, it is really a bargain.  If you don&#x27;t have a Sonicare, order one today.  If you have an older model, definitely consider upgrading to the Elite.  This is a wonderful product! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Okay, I have to admit it seems expensive, but sometimes you have to pay a premium price to get a premium product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned a 7800 I purchased at the dentist a year and a half ago.  The only problem I have with this toothbrush is that I am additcted to it.  I go into a panic if I don&#x27;t have it with me on a trip.  (I travel a lot).  My wife thought it a bit expensive when we first bought it, but now (because I travel) we actually bought a SECOND one.  Now we both have it full time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My teeth are whiter, cleaner than ever before.  I initially bought the 7800 after getting my teeth cleaned at the dentist.  A year later, I was in and out of the hygenist chair in just 15 minutes.  They asked me what I was doing different.  I said I was using the toothbrush they recommended, the Sonicare. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Oh, one other thing:  when I talked to the hygenist about this toothbrush, she said she gets to try them all, and she continues to use the sonicare as her number one choice.  I agree completely.  GREAT TOOTHBRUSH.  Spend the money, you&#x27;ll be happy you did.</li>
    <li> I have had mine for a year and it still works great.  My teeth just don&#x27;t feel clean unless I use my Sonicare.  My teeth are much whiter now too.</li>
    <li> I feel that this product does a better job of cleaning and whitening my teeth than any other product I have used.  I tried the strips, which only whitened.  I&#x27;ve tried the battery operated brushes, which are just OK.  This made a difference in the look and feel of my teeth.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I visited my dentist after using this item twice a day for six months and, for the first time ever, received high praise for my admirable oral care.  I shared my secret, the SonicCare, and my dentist was not at all surprised.  Truthfully, this is a marvelous instrument for getting and maintaining healthy teeth and most importantly gums. Use this along with those little brushes that go between teeth to get rid of plaque, and you will be very happy.  This is well worth the investment.  I really appreciate the 30 second beeps, so I know to change quadrants.  It is easy to use, travels well in the little case, and can hold a charge for several days if you are away from your charger.  Just be sure to replace the brush every 6 months, it really does make a difference.  And remember to clean the whole unit at least once a week, as water &amp; toothpaste can seep down into the inner workings.</li>
    <li> I bought the original Sonicare when it first came out -- 20 years ago? I don&#x27;t remember. The technology clearly works. My dentist reports a significant improvement in plaque. I have never used any of the other \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; toothbrushes. I imagine they work as well.     My original Sonicare just started acting up. It still works, but I think the battery is dying. So I bought the e7300. First impressions are that Philips went for glitz over quality and has added all kinds of marginally useful or even useless \\&quot;features\\&quot; so they can engage in marketing hype and jack up the price. It looks to be more cheaply made. I would be surprised if this unit lasts even a fraction of the 20 years of the original unit. It looks to me like it was designed to fail.     I was annoyed by the very first page of the manual. It tells me to make sure the handle is properly seated in the base, because if it is put in wrong, the charging light may still come on, but it won&#x27;t charge. What kind of engineering is this? If it&#x27;s not charging, don&#x27;t turn the light on. Don&#x27;t they have engineers smart enough to figure that out? So I tested it. Sure enough, you can put the handle in any which way and the charging light comes on. This is just lazy or careless design work.     Worse, the base is too small, too light, and too shallow. In the original unit, the handle goes well over an inch into the base and there is only one way it will fit. With this unit, the base only holds the handle by about a half inch so it&#x27;s easy to put it in wrong. And sure enough, no matter how you put it in, even half falling out, the charging light lights up. Looks like it was designed by the marketing department?     Then there&#x27;s the idiotic 2-minute shutoff. I can see zero benefits and several disadvantages. First of all, why are they shutting it off after 2 minutes? Do they think I might leave it on or am too lazy to turn it off myself. This is a clear case of terminal helpfulness.     But that&#x27;s not the most annoying problem. You do NOT want to take the thing out of your mouth while it is running or you will spray toothpaste and spit everywhere. After a few uses, I am operating on autopilot. When I finish brushing, I click the on/off button to turn it off and remove it from my mouth in one simultaneous motion. If you happen to finish brushing just as the thing shuts off (after 2 minutes), clicking the on/off button will actually turn it back on as you are removing it from your mouth. Now you will have a nice little task of cleaning the mirror, the sink, your shirt, the wall, the floor... Nice. #@$%#$@!!! I have done this a few times. Not good.    Personally, I find the \\&quot;timer signal\\&quot; every 30 seconds annoying, too. I just want a simple on/off button. It&#x27;s a toothbrush, not the control panel for a heart-lung machine. KISS. Actually, I have no problem with this \\&quot;feature\\&quot; if some people are unable to figure out how to brush without a built-in timer as long as the company provides a way to turn the infernal thing off. But clearly they think they know what I need better than I do.    In the original model, I could at least turn off the 30-second reminders by holding the on/off button for a few seconds -- simple. With this \\&quot;improved\\&quot; model, they have added a \\&quot;dual speed\\&quot; button, but it only works while in the charger. Now that&#x27;s convenient. I have the charger at the back of the sink behind the radio and out of the way. Now I have to move the charger to where I can actually see it. My guess is that they are again protecting me from myself so I won&#x27;t accidentally change the settings while I am using the unit. Did they test this on morons? Did they test it at all?    The ultimate insult to injury is in the instructions on recycling the battery. I am told to first deplete the battery. I am to do this by removing the unit from the charger, turning it on, and letting it run until it stops. But it stops every 2 minutes! Since they brag that the unit can be used for 2 weeks (twice a day) on a full charge, they are really asking me to stand there for an hour (2x2x14 minutes) and restart the unit 28 times. Like that is going to happen.    On the bright side, it comes with a very nice travel case. I used to toss my old one in my dopp kit, which is probably why it broke and I bought this piece of junk.    Summary: The technology works. This unit was designed to fail early so that you would buy a new one. I give it 3 stars for cleaning teeth and 0 stars for arrogant, cheap design and being overpriced.    07/30/10 I have since junked this thing and bought an Oral B Sonic Complete. ([[ASIN:B0002M50Z6 Oral B S-320 Sonic Complete Rechargeable Power Toothbrush]]) What a difference. The Oral B is well designed (with one minor annoyance) and it cleans better. I have a mouth guard. I clean it every morning. It had become yellowed over the years. After a few days with the Oral B, it has lost most of the yellowing. I am downgrading the Sonicare to a 1 in comparison to the Oral B. Check it out.</li>
    <li> I had an older model sonicare that i thought was great for a long time in fact i still have it use it for travel, anyway i think the elite 7300 power toothbrush is a great product and does just what it says, and if lasts half as long as my other sonicare i will buy another sonicare product.</li>
    <li> great design allows reaching way back on the molars. very quick way to do an excellent brushing job.</li>
    <li> ...but I&#x27;ll say it anyway.  This is an excellent product.  I bought the 7300 model...I only wish everything I buy was of this quality and effectiveness.  Everyone I tell about Sonicare says something like &amp;quot;Oh,yes, it&#x27;s supposed to get your teeth whiter&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Yeah, I have one of those where the brush spins.&amp;quot;  I then explain to them that no, it&#x27;s not a spinning brush, and no, I don&#x27;t use it because it makes my teeth whiter (although it does).  When my dentist sold me my first Sonicare, he told me that in his opinion using Sonicare is like having microsurgery for gum disease, without the trauma and expense.&lt;br /&gt;My next 3-month checkup after starting to use my Sonicare was the first one in my life where I had no cavities, no work to be done, and no bleeding gums.  I&#x27;ve had several similar checkups since then.  I attribute these results to Sonicare since that was the only change I made in my dental regimen.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t already have a Sonicare, buy one.  You won&#x27;t regret it.  Buy one for everyone you love.  It may sound like a lot of money for a toothbrush, but it&#x27;s worth way more than what it costs.  I&#x27;ve already saved thousands in dental bills by using Sonicare.  If mine somehow got lost, stolen or broken, I&#x27;d have to buy another one the same day.  I&#x27;ll never be without one again.</li>
    <li> As an owner of an \\&quot;original\\&quot; Sonicare (on my second actually) I am writing this review more from the perspective of whether the Elite is worth $[$$]+ as an \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;First, from an aesthetic and ergonomic point on view the Elite is a big step forward.  The handle is lighter and has a tapered shape with a rubber grip.  More importantly the brush head is smaller and is more of a diamond shape rather than the \\&quot;original\\&quot; rectangle.  The brush head \\&quot;neck\\&quot; is also angled to provide easier access to the back teeth and \\&quot;flexes\\&quot; both horizontally and vertically.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the Elite just does not seem as \\&quot;powerful\\&quot; as the original.  This is based not only on my subjective opinion of the \\&quot;feel\\&quot; while brushing but also on an objective \\&quot;look\\&quot; at the brush head while powered on.  Whereas the original has bristles that travel through a 90 degree arc, the Elite bristles barely travel at all.  Granted, this may be in part due to the smaller/shorter bristles.  Sonicare claims that the Elite is actually better from a functional point of view and I cannot say otherwise, so I will give them the benefit of the doubt.  (yes, i tested with the \\&quot;beginner mode\\&quot; turned off)&lt;br /&gt;Also, after six weeks of usage, one of the magnets on the Elite brush head appears to have rusted significantly.  This was never a problem with the \\&quot;original\\&quot; Sonicare brush heads.  Whether this affects performance or not I cannot say.  As the brush head enters its third, fourth or fifth month of service I can only assume that the changes for decreased performance would increase.  Also, black \\&quot;moldy\\&quot; appearing deposits accumulate in the handle \\&quot;well\\&quot; which, also, never occured with the \\&quot;original\\&quot;.  My guess here is that water is allowed to accumulate inside the brush head and handle well because of the flexible rubber housing (between the brush head \\&quot;nut\\&quot; and \\&quot;neck\\&quot;) allows for the 360 degree \\&quot;flex\\&quot; I mentioned earlier-this housing is not sealed.  When I inquired, Sonicare denied(not having seen theunit) that what I was seeing was rust, and referred me to the cleaning instructions.  Take that for what it is worth...&lt;br /&gt;I have found one interesting thing... While the \\&quot;original\\&quot; brush head will not fit the Elite handle, the Elite brush head WILL fit the \\&quot;original\\&quot; handle.  I detect no difference in the brushing experience using that combination.&lt;br /&gt;My recommendations therefore are:&lt;br /&gt;1) if you have never had a Sonicare then by all means buy the \\&quot;Elite\\&quot;... (but be wary of the rusting problem)&lt;br /&gt;2) if you currently have an \\&quot;original\\&quot; that is on its last legs then buy an Elite (again be wary of the rust)&lt;br /&gt;...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Elite 7300 for about a week now.  I really do enjoy it - my teeth feel like I&#x27;ve just been to the dentist.  I have fillings on the front of my teeth, and food frequently gets caught on the rough surfaces.  Not anymore!  The only real drawback I&#x27;ve found is brushing my tongue - brushing it with the toothbrush on sprays toothpaste all over the bathroom, and brushing it with the toothbrush off (like an old fashioned manual toothbrush) is annoying because the toothbrush head is very small.  LOVE the 2 minute timer, and I just can&#x27;t say enough that I LOVE how my teeth feel. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I had a tough time deciding on the different Elite lines, because I didn&#x27;t find any helpful info on the difference between the models.  So I&#x27;m going to tell you. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The 7800 allows you to change the pre-programmed 2 minute brushing time to 2 1/2 minutes.  It also comes with a \\&quot;luxury brush holder\\&quot; - a wall mount kit.  Also has a dual speed control and different charger indicator.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The 7500 comes with the stuff above, except not the timer change option.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The 7300 does not come with any of that, and works just fine.  No need to spend the extra cash - it&#x27;s fine just the way it is.</li>
    <li> I had an older model a while back, and hated the way it buzzed, and sprayed toothpaste all over the place.  It was also awkward, and I gave up and went back to a regular toothbrush.  But, then I lost dental insurance, and wanted to be able to keep my teeth cleaner between visits, so started shopping Amazon again.  It&#x27;s so great to be able to read reviews. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy with this toothbrush.  It&#x27;s light, and the word \\&quot;elegant\\&quot; actually comes to mind.  The brush head is much smaller than the old dynosaur I had, and it doesn&#x27;t buzz as much, and doesn&#x27;t spray toothpaste around much at all.  I haven&#x27;t reached for \\&quot;old faithful\\&quot; since I bought this model.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush based on the other good reviews and it was worth it!!  I can&#x27;t go into detail in design because for me it doesn&#x27;t matter.  I have owned electric toothbrushes, but they were about 30 bucks or so.  I got the 7300 because of the price - much less than the 7500.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It has been a wonderful experience.  I have been using it for about 2 months and my dentist is amazed.  I had periodontal disease (?)  My gums were a wretched horror and the condition is totally reversed.  My dentsist wanted to do a scaling and now it is not necessary.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I still don&#x27;t floss as I should, but my gums are pink, now and the pockets aren&#x27;t as deep and most have disappeared.  I give this product two thumbs up and I will buy another one in the future.</li>
    <li> I bit the bullet and bought this toothbrush a couple months ago because my dentist diagnosed me with periodontal disease after he found about 5 cavities, recessed gums, and 32 sites of bleeding along my gumline. Granted, I hadn&#x27;t had a professional cleaning in over 2 years. I also have crowded teeth due to my wisdom teeth, which make it especially hard to clean in the back of my mouth. I decided to buy the Sonicare as an investment, after paying around $1,000 for all the fillings, cleanings, and root planing &amp; scaling he had to do over the course of 2 months to treat my disease. Well, I think it worked because last week I went for a follow-up and the hygienist said that my teeth looked noticeably cleaner, AND my periodontal pockets had shrunken and the number of bleeding sites had reduced from 32 to 4!  I can&#x27;t attribute all of this to the Sonicare because I&#x27;m sure their treatment and my longer brushing sessions due to the Sonicare&#x27;s timer helped a lot too, but I&#x27;m confident that at least part of the improvement was due to the Sonicare&#x27;s superior cleaning. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I had the original Sonicare a few years ago, but it died on me. I&#x27;m glad I upgraded to this new one because it reaches the rear, hard-to-reach areas much easier than the last one, thanks to the slimmer head and angled brush.  That&#x27;s especially important for someone like me whose rear teeth are the most vulnerable to problems. The new model is also lighter, looks sleeker, and has a rubber grip (I love the tactile feel of those). The 7300 has a charge indicator, which frankly I don&#x27;t feel is a big deal because I always return the brush to its charging unit after use anyway. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Using the Sonicare takes some getting used to for newbies because it may tickle and feel weird, but it has a ramp-up feature that gradually increases the speed during the first few uses. Once you get used to it though, it&#x27;s nothing. I enjoy the invigorating feeling of it, and my mouth just feels so clean afterwards. Theunit has a pacer that makes sure you spend 30 seconds on each of the 4 sections of your mouth, which is good because it forces you to brush correctly. However, it is annoying if you like to brush your tongue like I do, because then you have to turn it on for another few seconds to do that (you get used to it though)-I believe the higher model allows you to customize the timer to allow for additional brush time.  The timer can be a little annoying when you&#x27;re exhausted and just want to brush as fast as possible, but that&#x27;s just me being lazy-I always feel a surge of guilt when I turn it off prematurely, which may be a good thing because my teeth and gums (and wallet) will probably thank me in the long run for brushing properly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Another thing that takes getting used to is the amount of foam the brush generates due to its sonic action-I like to keep my mouth slightly open when I&#x27;m brushing so I can make sure I&#x27;m getting all the areas and am angling the brush correctly (they recommend keeping it at around a 30 degree angle to your tooth surface), so in the beginning I would drool toothpaste foam each time. I&#x27;m gotten better though, so there&#x27;s usually just a little foam dribble now! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not only does my mouth feel spotless after using the Sonicare, but my teeth have gotten noticeably whiter too-several people have commented on that. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I sometimes buy gadgets and get tired when their novelty wears off, but that hasn&#x27;t happened with the Sonicare-I have used it virtually daily for the last couple of months and am hooked.  I traveled once and left it at home, and I felt so caveman-like sticking that big blunt old-fashioned toothbrush in my mouth during that time.  Not to mention that my mouth didn&#x27;t feel as clean. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have a set that came with extra heads, a head storage stand, and a deluxe travel case.  Each head has a different colored band around the neck, which is great because you can share it with your partner and keep trackof which head is whose.  The case is a nice touch for traveling-I took mine without the charging base on a 4-day trip recently during which I shared it with a friend (i.e., 4 uses per day) and it lasted the whole trip and then some on a single charge. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Keeping the unit clean can be annoying because the well into which you screw on the head accumulates water which eventually starts to discolor and smell like mold/mildew. In order to minimize this, I take the head off after each use, shake the water out of the well, and allow the unit to air-out while it sits in the charger base-but the smell still happens, albeit more slowly. Therefore, every couple of weeks, I clean the well and my brush head with a bleach solution to disinfect and deodorize everything.  I&#x27;m curious to see how long this unit lasts, because it seems that many people complain of Sonicares dying after a year.  My original one lasted over a year, but I used it very infrequently (never got hooked on it). I hope the new one lasts a while, because it was expensive! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All in all, I highly recommend the Sonicare, especially for people with dental problems. Don&#x27;t waste your money on the original (\\&quot;Advanced\\&quot;) model because this one is so much better.</li>
    <li> A long time ago my husband and I used one of those water jet tooth brushes. I liked the way it cleaned but it was kind of a hassle to prep and clean. For some reason we retired it and never went back. We got two Sonicare toothbrushes on my dentists recommendation  a year ago because regualr brushing was wearing down my tooth enamel at the gum line. The design is very well thought out, reasonably comfortable to use, and from my recent dentist vist -- results are good too. There are a couple of things I&#x27;d like to see impoved some how: easier cleaning of the inside of the handle and brush where they attach, and lower the cost of the replacement brushes.  Over all, though, its a top notch product. Like others have said, I also like the 2 minute pacing timer.</li>
    <li> All I can say is that it works.  When you turn it on it vibrates (a lot) which created an intense tickling sensation on the inside of my cheeks and gums. I got used to this after a few days though. So far I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent toothbrush.  It&#x27;s small enough to get to the back teeth and other hard to reach areas.  At my last dental check-up, my gums had improved and I know it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m using the Sonicare toothbrush.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have the older model of the Sonicare Elite e series. I bought 3 of these this year as Christmas presents.  I will not use any other toothbrush.  I recently had a professional teeth cleaning.  They said that my teeth and gums were in great shape. I don&#x27;t remember the last time(5yrs +) that I had had a cleaning before that.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I bought this model as an upgrade to my old Sonicare (which gave me about 8 years of use!).  The e7300 is greatly improved: faster brush; lighter handle; and tapered to reach backsides of teeth much better.  After a week of using this model, my teeth feel like I&#x27;ve just had them cleaned at the dentist (but without the sore gums).  Highly recommended and well worth the money, considering the benefits to oral health.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I purchase this product.  I&#x27;m very happy with this toothbrush and it truly makes a difference when used daily. Gives you the clean feeling a regular toothbrush doesn&#x27;t usually give you.  I have no complaints thus far. Only wish the toothbrush heads would be a little cheaper.</li>
    <li> This brush cleans very well! You will see and feel a big difference once using an electric toothbrush.   My problem with this toothbrush is that the brush connects to the handle by screwing the brush onto the handle. Water seeps into the hollow compartment and is very hard to clean. I would recommend the Oral-B Sonic complete toothbrush which cleans as well as Sonicare, has a better brush (larger, smother), is easier to clean, and is less expensive.</li>
    <li> Do yourself a favor and buy the Sonicare Flex Care. The newer Flex Care models are an upgrade without the screw-on design flaw of this Sonicare model. This model has a hideous design where the saliva and other brushing liquids seep down into the inner mechanisms of the hand piece and pool up in a really disgusting way and requires you to take it apart and clean off inner crevices made up of metal and plastic parts. The new design eliminates all that slew of slime. This brushing action is fantastic, just like the new one, but this design stinks...literally.</li>
    <li> The Sonicare Elite e7300 power toothbrush is a wonderful product which cleans your teeth extremely well.  When we go to the dentist&#x27;s office for our 6 mo. check ups the hygienest says it&#x27;s so easy for her to clean our teeth because we use the electric toothbrush. It does the work for you ...no need to scrub your teeth!</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush. It has really helped my gums (in addition to flossing) according to my dental hygienist. It also leaves my teeth feeling fresh and clean after each brushing.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT product - we love the small brush head and it&#x27;s light weight.  Keeps the charge a long time too.</li>
    <li> I have used the older model Sonicare for quite wome time;it was good but bulky and heavy, so I expected more of the same with the Sonicare Elite.  But this Elite model is GREAT.  It&#x27;s easier to handle and even feels lighter.  It is angled and that makes it easier to use, so you&#x27;re able to get into areas you usually cannot.  Your teeth and mouth feel very clean.  So much better than the model before it. I was very pleasantly surprised. I know it&#x27;s expensive, but your teeth are worth it.  This Elite sonicare really looks after your teeth in a very nice way.  I heartily recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought an Elite 7500 model because that&#x27;s what the store had, but I don&#x27;t think there were many differences in the 7300 and the 7500. I wish I&#x27;d had this toothbrush a year or more ago. Maybe I wouldn&#x27;t have the degree of gum disease I do now. I bought my first and only Sonicare model after very high recommendations by my periodontist. After being examined by her the first time in June, I went back after having used the Sonicare consistently in September. The difference in the two exam&#x27;s results was phenomenal! The dentist couldn&#x27;t stop remarking over it! I had pockets of some degree or another around 80% of my teeth; on the 2nd visit, this had been reduced to about 10%, it was that effective on my teeth AND gums. I love the \\&quot;massage\\&quot; feeling while I&#x27;m brushing too. There&#x27;s been absolutely no mechanical problems with any part of it, or any \\&quot;cosmetic\\&quot; flaws, after 4 months of use, still looks brand new! I now have TWO dentists raving about the condition of my teeth! (And my primary dentist is NOT known for his raving.)</li>
    <li> We have owned 3 Sonicare toothbrushes; each one wears out after about 15 months of use.  What happens is the timer or the on / off switch seems to go bad.  The effect is the unit shuts off after about 30 seconds of use; holding down the on / off switch buys another 10 seconds or so; then 5 seconds; then nothing.&lt;br /&gt;For a product as expensive as this, stay away unless replacing it every 15 months is within your plan as it does do a good job cleaning your teeth.</li>
    <li> I have been brushing with Sonicare for just over a year now - starting with the 4700, and now with the 7300. I cannot praise Sonicare enough! People accuse me of being a walking commercial, but when you find something this great - you&#x27;ve just got to share the joy.&lt;br /&gt;Before Sonicare, visiting my dentist was always a really horrible experience. Despite my best efforts with my previous electric brush, all too often it would take two appointments just for a routine cleaning. The hygienist had to scale (and scale, and scale) by hand - because my teeth and gums were very sensitive, and because I had such deep &amp;quot;pockets&amp;quot; (yes, gum disease!) that the electronic scaler could not do the whole job anyway. I needed gas to make it through! It seemed like I always had another little cavity somewhere, and to make things worse, there was the constant look of disappointment from my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I had to find a solution. I spoke to a co-worker who raved about his Sonicare 4700. I decided to give it a try. It was a little expensive, but after brushing with it just once - I knew my teeth were miles cleaner right away. The &amp;quot;sonic&amp;quot; part took some getting used to, but I was determined. After a week or so, the brush&#x27;s strong massaging action began to feel really good, and I actually looked forward to brushing. &lt;br /&gt;In one week, my teeth were much whiter. As time went by, my gums became pink and healthy looking. Who knew blood did not have to accompany brushing?&lt;br /&gt;Still, even though I knew things were improving, I put off going in for cleaning. All things considered, can you blame me? When I realized it had been nearly 16 months, I finally screwed up the courage to go. &lt;br /&gt;I had my first post-Sonicare cleaning just last week. I had been in the chair only a few short minutes when, after picking at my teeth a little and blinking her eyes a lot, the hygienist abruptly left the room. I moaned to myself, &amp;quot;What, does she need a jack hammer?&amp;quot;Turned out she couldn&#x27;t find any more to scale, and she was so amazed she brought in the dentist! &lt;br /&gt;With Sonicare, I have finally conquered calculus. Even better, all traces of gum disease are GONE!!! &amp;quot;Pockets&amp;quot; that were &amp;quot;6&amp;quot;, are now &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; - perfect! When I left the office, my dentist smiled at me and said, &amp;quot;Great job!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;I think both Sonicare models are terrific. The standard brush head on the 4700 was a little big to easily reach my back teeth (but I have a pretty small mouth.) Buying the &amp;quot;compact&amp;quot; head reduced that problem. The new 7300 features a brush head that is like a regular toothbrush in size and shape. I find the 7300 far easier to maneuver, but that&#x27;s just my personal experience. The cleaning function seems equal. &lt;br /&gt;Sure, the Sonicare is a little pricey and the &amp;quot;sonic action&amp;quot; takes some getting used to, but the pay off of healthy teeth and gums far outweighs those considerations. My 4700 obviously worked great (and still does), but the new 7300&#x27;s smaller brush and lighter handle are really a perfect fit for me. I have not experienced any of the problems mentioned here - but even if I did.... I&#x27;d buy another Sonicare without a moment&#x27;s hesitation.</li>
    <li> Good buy especially for the money.  I like the two minute timer &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This new slightly angled brush head is great. I have used a Sonicare for about 4 years and the new design is much better. &lt;br /&gt;Sonicare use has really improved my gums which had been bleeding and  receeding.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Sonicare toothbrush for 3 years -- and recently upgraded to the Sonicare Elite 7300.  The brush head is smaller and more comfortable to use -- and it gets my teeth as white as they can be.  No need for whitening strips and other products if you&#x27;re using the Sonicare, that&#x27;s for sure. My dentist says my teeth/gums have never been healthier!</li>
    <li> I went into the dentist and he was horrified with how bad my teeth were. He told me that if I didn&#x27;t do something fast, I was going to lose most of my teeth. My pockets were 6&#x27;7 and 7&#x27;s. My checkup last week they are 2&#x27;s. I had 8 cavities filled, and a couple deep cleanings, and this toothbrush is what&#x27;s helping with the repair and maintenance of my teeth. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Appears to do a fine job brushing my teeth, and is quite easy to use.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended the Sonicare toothbrush at my most recent visit. I was a bit taken aback by the price but I figured that if it was so highly recommended I&#x27;d give it a try. I love it! My teeth feel as clean as they did right after my dental check-up. And the Smartimer and Quadpacer features that come with the e7300 are awesome. Now I&#x27;m sure that every part of my mouth is getting the attention it deserves. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you frequently travel internationally, like me, you should note that the unit holds its charge for up to 2 weeks. So you can leave the charger home for short trips. For longer trips, you should buy a separate charger for the region you&#x27;re headed to (e.g Europe uses a 210-240V charger).</li>
    <li> I have used Sonicare for years. It produces wonderful results in dental hygiene. I just received this new model. The entire package is encased in an impenetrable hard-plastic clamshell with no way to get in. You will need cutting tools and gloves. Be careful you don&#x27;t damage the Sonicare or your hands when wrestling with this devilish and unnecessary covering. I didn&#x27;t wear gloves and cut my hand on one of the razor-sharp plastic edges.  5 Stars for the Sonicare itself; 1 Star for the Packaging producing the 3 star result.</li>
    <li> This replaced a 9YO Sonicare that died in an interstate move.  I first bought an a4100 which lacked a major feature; then I got this one.  My only surprise with this one is the brushes themselves; the heads are smaller (that&#x27;s a good thing), but the bristles seem to be firmer (not so sure about that), and that&#x27;s true of the more colorful compact heads, too.  But the old one kept me out of the perio&#x27;s chair, and this one will too, and that&#x27;s what counts.    18 months later: The on-button has a flexible covering that has now perforated at the top, allowing moisture to get inside the barrel.  I&#x27;ve covered it with clear tape and so far so good, but I have doubts about its longevity.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush really cleans my teeth well.  I have never felt my teeth so thoroughly clean before.  It&#x27;s very easy to use - Just push the power button when you are ready to brush, put the brush against your teeth, move the brush around your mouth and let the brush do the rest of the work. It comes with a default 2-minute timer setting for each brushing job but if you want to brush longer, you can just push the power button again.  You can also adjust the brush speed but I don&#x27;t find it particularly necessary or useful.  The manufacturer recommends change brush head every six months but I guess applying common sense makes more sense here.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush.  It is small, holds a charge for a long time and cleans your teeth and gums effectively.  I don&#x27;t like the fact that they charge you an arm and a leg for head replacements.  This is the classic razor/razorblade product approach.</li>
    <li> The Philips Sonicare Elite e7300 is an excellent product.  After the first time using it, it felt like I just had my teeth professionally cleaned.  I am going to buy one for each of my children. I would highly recommend this product.  Great for the health of your teeth and gums.  Simply Excellent.</li>
    <li> Too many reviews;   I&#x27;ll do this one in Haiku!   Let&#x27;s dive into it.     Saw all prior views   of Sonicare customers   Amazon provides.     Key to the debate:   whether cheaper is better,   or price wins the day.     Higher on dollars --   e7300 (\\&quot;e seventy-three hundred\\&quot;) --   this very brush here.    Then there is this brush ([[ASIN:B000FEIOHW Philips Sonicare Xtreme e3000 Power Toothbrush (Blue)]])  Cheaper, with features to match   (save only a few).     We bought both brushes,   one each for my wife and me.   Experimented.     Used both Sonicares.   Brushed ev&#x27;ry night, she and I.   Same treatment, same care.     Endlessly we sparred.   Three months later, here we are.   One emerged victor.     Three months was too much --   for the cheaper brush was crushed.   Suddenly it died.     No water damage,   no mishandling, no neglect.   It just died -- kaput!     Here is my advice:   for relability   shun the cheaper brush.     Yet consider thus:   THIS costs three times more than THAT.   It should give you pause.     You&#x27;ll likely agree:   THAT must fail three times &#x27;fore we  declare this the best.     For is this not true:   fail three times before I do   end up losing out?     The price of this, though   more reliable, cannot   beat the other&#x27;s cost.     Friend, it&#x27;s up to you.   Buy this or try two of those;   Less than three duds wins!</li>
    <li> This is my second SONICARE product.  It is an addition to the old one my wife and I have used daily for five years. It works even better than the old one and cost a bit less. Very satisfied!!!!    WEROGERS</li>
    <li> I have used the Sonicare brand toothbrush forever it seems, I loved this thing and every time i put on a new brush head it was that great feeling you can&#x27;t get from a regular toothbrush. But I have no idea what is going on as I have had to replace 3 of these in less than 1 years time. The first time I thought it was a fluke but after 3 times I am wondering what the heck brand of batteries are in these things. I was about to throw out the 3rd one until i pressed the button and held it down as if I were resetting it and it worked, but I need to do that EVERY time now. Done with sonicare going to try Oral B.</li>
    <li> Re: Philips Sonicare Elite e7300 Power Toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;I had this for about 6 months and then it totally stopped working; the green button started to tear inwards about 2 months ago and now it will not turn on nor recharge.</li>
    <li> My Oral-B electric died and I got this one. I love it! It gets my teeth so clean. The battery also lasts for a much longer time.    Great toothbrush!</li>
    <li> I was very sceptical about spending this kind of money on a toothbrush, but this one is worth it. It does virtually all the work for you&#x27;; when done brushing you feel like you had a thorough cleaning. It is extremely easy to operate and program. I still feel this is brush quite pricey, but overall I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I liked it enough to buy two more for my family I bught them at my dentist for half the price</li>
    <li> I have used a Sonicare toothbrush for about five years, and the old one was beginning to wear out. Based on my experience, I wanted another Sonicare.  The new one exceeded my expectations.  The new angled head fit my mouth better, it is lighter, and much more comfortable.  I am completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush is GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!  It feels like you&#x27;ve been to the dentist everytime I use it!  I love it!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am well please with the electric brush and recieve it right away.         &lt;br /&gt;                                              Thank You.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush is perfect.  The picture shows toothbrush, charger, travel case and stand with second head, which was not in my package.</li>
    <li> I bought the Elite a month ago to replace an Advantage model that quit after a couple years. (We have another Advantage that is going strong after around four or five years). The Elite e7300 is lighter than the Advantage and somewhat easier to use, due to the smaller diameter of the shaft. I can&#x27;t speak to its durability yet, but I&#x27;m happy so far with its design and how it cleans my teeth. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I was used to the battery operated Oral B cross-action toothbrush but when i decided to give this a try, it changed the way i looked at my cross action toothbrush. It was that much better and my teeth definitely has this sensation after I brush my teeth.</li>
    <li> What a great toothbrush. I have one and my wife has one. She was a hard sell but once she used it for a week she was SOLD! Now she even takes it with her on business trips rather than a normal toothbrush.    I have had mine for over 2 years and it still work great. The battery doesn&#x27;t last the 2 weeks it used to but it still only needs to be charged once a week or so. Not bad at all.    It is worth the money so pull the trigger.</li>
    <li> The Philips Sonicare Elite Toothbrush is wonderful.  I had an older model of the Sonicare and decided to upgrade  to this model.  I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
    <li> I have used this toothbrush for over 3 years, and have never had a single problem with it.</li>
    <li> Actually, great brushing action.  Very pleased with that.  But product life is horrible.  Spent over $130.00 and the on-off switch died in less than one year.  Just plain bad quality.</li>
    <li> A great electric toothbrush. Does a terrific job of leaving teeth feeling clean. However, it has only four 30-second cycles per use. For the slightly greater price I would recommend the model that has five 30-second cycles so that it is possible to clean the chewing surfaces of the back teeth without having to turn it on again.</li>
    <li> Everyone in my family has the Sonicare. We purchased 4 after our dental hygienist recommended the technology.&lt;br /&gt;This was 3 years ago. What have we experienced in those 3 years?&lt;br /&gt;1. Once you use this technology a normal / manual toothbrush will make your mouth seem dirty after brushing&lt;br /&gt;2. The automated timing and beeps, if followed properly, will &#x27;remind&#x27; you to brush thoroughly&lt;br /&gt;3. The gums DO NOT RECEDE because of the Sonicare: you still need to floss and remove plaque build up (but less thereoff); this point is made since some people seem to blame this technology for dental issues on here. Ask your dentist!&lt;br /&gt;4. The have ONE SERIOUSLY DISGUSTING DESIGN FLAW: saliva, toothpaste etc. flows into the opening of the screw on brush heads and you will find a stinking slimy residue in there unless you take the head off every 2 days for a serious boiling. This is the one reason we removed stars.&lt;br /&gt;5. We upgraded to the new FLEXCARE RS980 versions with the UV sanitizer and the design flaw has been corrected (plus replacement brush heads are half the price).</li>
    <li> I bought this specific model in Dec. 2005 and it&#x27;s as good as (almost) new today. Prior to this Sonicare I had an earlier model which I used for about 4-5 years. With the risk of this reading like one of those fake &#x27;I lost 500 pounds in 2 months&#x27; ads, the fact is that, prior to me starting to use Sonicare I was having some gum problems and I had cavities. I had no new cavities ever since and my dentist is no longer worried about my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A necessary warning: it should be noted that Sonicare is not be good for everyone. My wife, for example, can&#x27;t stand the vibrating brush while I love it and so do the kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not going to discuss the technology here - it&#x27;s well explained in the product description section. What is worth noting is that, speaking for my self, my teeth have never been cleaner or healthier. I still do twice-per-year dentist cleaning sessions but I no longer have to subject myself to the dreadful &#x27;deep cleaning&#x27;. I&#x27;ve used Sonicare brushes for, apparently, 7-8 years and I am likely to continue using it until something better becomes available but I doubt that &#x27;something better&#x27; exists today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On this particular model:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ The 2 minute cycle is marked by &#x27;tones&#x27; every 30 seconds so you know when to switch to the next &#x27;quadrant&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;+ There is a button that switches from hi-vibe to lo-vibe. I always use it at max power but it&#x27;s good to know that you have the option.&lt;br /&gt;+ A row of little, green LED&#x27;s tell you how charged the battery is.&lt;br /&gt;- The body has rubber grips over its native plastic. After less than one year, the bottom began to disintegrate, possibly because of constant moisture in the charging base. 4 years later, only the bottom is affected but it&#x27;s not a pretty site. I&#x27;d like it better with plastic all-over.&lt;br /&gt;+ One full charge should keep you going for one week. After all these years of using it twice-daily, it still runs for one week after a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D; You will need to replace the brush head every six months or so.&lt;br /&gt;+ A carrying case is included. I found it very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;+ My one call to customer service went very well, back in 2005. It was answered by someone speaking perfect American English who, patiently, helped me recognize the &#x27;tones&#x27; the toothbrush was producing every 30 seconds - silly me, I was expecting to hear some &#x27;beep&#x27; while the toothbrush signals the 30-second via a change in the vibration pitch.is included.

    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time and I really feel good whit this tooth brush. It greatly remove all dirty things in my mouth and easy to unse and brush.  What a Good Product !!!</li>
    <li> This is the worlds best toothbrush. It give you a dentis clean feel every time you use it. Its great! But 109 bucks you say? Think about every time you go to the dentist. Can you think of anything better then that dentist clean feel? NOw your thinking this guy&#x27;s stupid how could it give you a dentis clean feel heards how. Well basicly and um scientificly it spins realy fast so it polishes your teeth and gets all the junk out of the crevices.</li>
    <li> I waited many months before purchasing this toothbrush, mainly because of the price.  I have been quite happy with this toothbrush since I received it and started using it.  It took a few days before I was accustomed to the vibration of the brush on my lips, but that was my only problem.  I appreciate the timer because I know I am getting the recommended brushing time in.  I have had the brush for three months and find I need to replace my brush.  The recommended replacement with the system is 6 months.  I guess I brush more than normal.</li>
    <li> I had been thinking a while about purchasing a Sonicare Elite 7300 toothbrush but had been apprehensive about it for various reasons.  I thought the timed cleaning cycle would take too long or that my permanent partial might be damaged by it. The deciding point came when my husband was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s.  He had difficulty using a manual toothbrush and though an electric one would help, so I purchased two toothbrushes from Amazon, one for each of us.  When they arrived, while they were pretty difficult to get out of the packaging (use scissors) but they were easy to put together and we charged them up the 24 hours they required.  The first time I used it was rather comedic - I tried to stop the brush (the on/off button is hard to push), took the brush out of my mouth before it finished and promptly splashed everything around me (including myself). But even with the first use, I have to say that my teeth have never felt better or looked cleaner.  The two minute cycle is really not that long and using it on my partial hasn&#x27;t caused a problem.   I find that I brush better with it, targeting spots that I hadn&#x27;t before with a manual toothbrush. I can say that now I feel less self-conscious when I smile.  My husband also found that it worked for him too - it&#x27;s very light and the handle is well shaped for him to hold.  Again, the only drawback I can see if the on/off button - it really needs to be pushed hard.  It&#x27;s one of the few things I&#x27;ve purchased that I really think is worth the money.</li>
    <li> I read here people throwing them out because battery died.I just bought this brush and already took the handle apart and got to the battery.  There is a small palstic cap opposite the ON switch,kind of rectangular.  Take it out and pull the head of the brush.  The inside of it comes out and you&#x27;ll see the battery.It is not a normal size,but i&#x27;m sure it can be replaced with a little bit of research.  I hope this information helps.</li>
    <li> I bought two Sonicare Elite 7300 toothbrushes - one for my husband and I and the other for my 10yr old son. He was always getting comments at the dentist that his hygiene was bad and he needed to brush more and if I didnt actually stand over him he only brushed for 20 seconds. After 3 months he went back to the dentist and they gave him an excellent report. In fact they could find no problems!! They said his teeth were in fantastic shape and they no longer had that yellow film.  Of course we had already noticed that! This brush is terrific. My son even likes to look in the mirror at how white his teeth are now. Plus he uses it till it shuts off after 2 mins &lt;br /&gt;I did have a Sonicare about 10 yrs ago but never really used it cause I couldnt build up to it - the vibrations were too strong but I didnt have any of those problems this time. &lt;br /&gt;This brush is wonderful. The only thing we had a problem with was my son&#x27;s brush started to get dirty looking inside so now he separates the brushead after cleaning his teeth instead of leaving it all as one and both the charger and brush stay clean</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet.  My old one sprang to life when I purchased the new one.</li>
    <li> I bought the electric toothbrush for my husband. I already have one and feel like it cleans my teeth better than an ordinary toothbrush. It does take some getting used to (as any electric toothbrush would, I think). It was recommended by my dentist.</li>
    <li> I had a Sonicare for years but this model is better than before, it stays charged for days without charging (when traveling), it cleanes  great! A++++ another great product from Sonicare!</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this product to me several years ago. I still am amazed at the compliments I receive on my teeth after using it all these years! Strangers I meet compliment me on how white my teeth are and what a great smile I have! I occasionally use my tooth whitener, but I use the Sonic Elite toothbrush twice a day and it truly makes a huge difference in the appearance of my teeth. I bought this for my son who is investing in his teeth. I am sure it will enhance the dental treatments he has received and will make him feel more confident as he meets new people.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush. I can&#x27;t describe how clean it makes my mouth feel... it is great. The built-in timer is really nice, so that I know how much time I&#x27;ve spent on my mouth. I have had other electric toothbrushes where the batteries get corroded and the brush becomes useless, but the Sonicare has a sealed compartment of rechargeable batteries, so that is not a problem. This was great for when I had braces, and it is really awesome now that I got my braces off. I know that these brushes are pricey, but they are worth it. Once you use this brush, if you go back to using a regular toothbrush you will realize how dirty your mouth still feels afterwards.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Sonicare Elite e7300, my third.  My wife and I both love them and I use one just for my business travel so I don&#x27;t have to pack up my home unit. I had an earlier version Philips but not the Elite and it died after about five years. Amazon had the best price by far and I compared prices with the local Military Exchange too.  BTW my Dentist loves it too!</li>
    <li> I initally bought my husband a Sonicare for Christmas at a department store, but happened upon a two-pack of the e7700 series at a warehouse club - for the same price!  Lucky me, I got to have one, too!  We both love this toothbrush.  My husband went on a business trip for a week and took a regular toothbrush, thinking it wouldn&#x27;t be that much of a difference (remember he&#x27;s had the Sonicare less than a month).  Well, he couldn&#x27;t wait to get home to use his Sonicare.    The angled head is great, and does a wonderful job cleaning your back teeth.  I didn&#x27;t think the Quadpacer would be a big deal, but I really like this feature.  Each time I use the Sonicare, my mouth feels soooo clean.    There were several Sonicare brushes available when I went shopping, but I chose this one because it is more slim-line than some of the other models.  The handle is a nice size, and not too big (diameter-wise).  I am petite, and found that some of the other models to be too big and less comfortable to hold.    If you want a fantastic toothbrush that makes your mouth feel like you just had a professional cleaning - I highly reccommend this brush.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush leaves your mouth feeling clean and invigorated.  No need to scrub your gums till they bleed, just guide the brush over your teeth and let the patented sonic action take care of the rest.  Easy to read battery meter shows when recharging is needed.  Handy built in timer lets you know when to switch to the next quadrant of your mouth.  I definatly get a better clean than with conventional brushes.  Replacement heads are a bit pricey buy you only need to change them twice a year.</li>
    <li> I had never used a Sonicare toothbrush until my friend recommended it.  My previous visit to the dentist (in Nov 2007) I was diagnosed with gingivitis and gum pocketing on several of my teeth.  I have to floss multiple times every day and water pick to keep my gums healthy.      I started using the Sonicare E7300 in late March of 2008.  I went to the dentist in early June.  All of the pocketing had gone.  I do not have to floss as much as I did before.  I also noticed some receded gums have now returned to their previous state.     This will save me thousands of dollars in scaling and planing and dental work that I would have had in the future when my teeth started to fall out from the periodontal disease.     This toothbrush was worth every penny and will save me much money (and pain) I would have had at the dentist&#x27;s office in the future.</li>
    <li> We had the 5500 series then it died. So now we bought the 7300 series and my husband  told  me he liked it better then the 5500 series.  The 7300 has the feature of the quad interval timer, which is very helpful.  We like that it beeps when you need to brush to another area of your mouth    It is so much easier brushing your teeth with Sonicare then with a regular manual toothbrush, we will never go back to manual brush.</li>
    <li> I replaced my old Sonicare with this one and i found this one to be much better. It is smaller, easier to handle, does not drip, easier to clean and does  great job on cleaning the teeth and gums</li>
    <li> Likes:  Feels like your teeth are much cleaner; faster to brush teeth&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes: you have to keep the threads clean as water gets in and causes the gunk; brush seems kinda small would prefer a larger brush; the settings and timings are too gimicky for me I just like to brush for a couple minutes and be done. If you are the same you should go for a less expensive base model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever you have an appliance like this in a wet environment you have to take care of it. After about a year of owning I noticed the power button starting to peel off from the handle (it is rubber). Since it has a two year warranty I called customer service and they send me a brand new Sonic (different model) within 4 days.  Great customer service and I now have a brand new toothbrush. Works for me!</li>
    <li> I have been using this brush for over 7 months now. It cleans very well. Solid brush that gets the job done. The only problem is the \\&quot;desposits\\&quot; collected behind the brush and the handle. Other than that, i would recommend this to anyone looking for a sonic brush.</li>
    <li> I have had two Sonicare toothbrushes and they both failed the same way, the on-off button wore out in about 1 year. Does a good job brushing, but will send you to the poor house. Also, as noted in several reviews, once the batteries are done so is the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be purchasing a third unit.</li>
    <li> The Philips Sonicare Elite e7300 Power Toothbrush from Philips Sonicare is a great toothbrush.  This product is highly effective at cleaning and maintaining a happy healthy smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the 2-minute Smartimer and 30-second Quadpacer interval timer because it helps to ensure that you brush all four quadrants of your mouth evenly and thoroughly.  I don&#x27;t like the Brush Head design because it accumulates germs and bacteria if not dissembled and thoroughly cleaned on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and a great value, it will provide many years of use and preventative care for your teeth.  I would however recommend a newer version of the Sonicare Toothbrush that use the Brush Heads with push on connectors, making it easier to clean and maintain.</li>
    <li> My Sonicare Elite lasted 2 or 3 years.  The cover came off of the on/off switch.  That means that water can get in and ruin the electronics.  It hasn&#x27;t failed yet only because I stopped using it.  I contacted Phillips support on line chat.  Nice people, but no offer to replace the unit.  Obviously it is out of warranty, but this type of failure should not happen until past 5 years.  [...]Please note that Sonicare will protect your teeth and it is money well spent.</li>
    <li> Excellent toothbrush. It went strong for a good 10 years before the battery finally quit on me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m buying another.</li>
    <li> This is my second toothbrush so that I can have one when I travel.  I LOVE it!  I have always had problem teeth and this toothbrush gets my teeth really clean!  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I purchased this toothbrush based on my sister-in-law&#x27;s experience.  Two years ago, her gums were in such bad shape, she had been referred to a specialist.  On his recommendation, she began to use the Sonicare toothbrush followed by a 60 second Listerine rinse.  By the next checkup, her dentist said the problem had been arrested.  She waltzes in and out of the dentist now with virtually no plaque, no sign of gum disease and a great smile.  Sounded good to me so I bought the toothbrush.  I like the thirty-second beeps and 2-minute shut down. Both make me much more conscious of putting in the time to do a thorough job of brushing.  Only problem I&#x27;ve encountered is the sound of the toothbrush scares my dog.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a worth while investment.  Our dentist recommended it to us and suggested we get the Elite 7300. My husband has sensitive gums therefore, it is a struggle for my him to brush and floss regularly.  With this toothbrush, he is able to get all the plague from around his gumline so that his teeth do not bleed anymore when brushing or flossing.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We have used the oral-B toothbrush for several years, however, my teeth have not ever felt as clean before and I am somewhat of a fanatic when it comes to brushing.  Hopefully, our next trip to the dentist will show that this toothbrush is as we both believe removing more plague than the oral-b. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While the toothbrush is more expensive than the oral-B, the refills are not far from the same.  I would definitely recommend this product and am going to suggest to our family and friends that they purchase one.</li>
    <li> Following the recommendation of friends, we bought our very first electric toothbrush and have been very satisfied with the quality of the brushing.  We have, however, been sorely disappointed by the shelf-life of this product.  Had we known how short the product life is we would not have invested the money into a Sonicare product.  The set with two heads cost over $100.  Every 6 months we bought two replacement heads for over $20.  Three years into using the product, the battery died.  Upon calling the manufacturer, we were informed that the battery life should be 5 to 7 years; the warranty is only 2 years; the battery cannot be replaced and all we can do is throw away our still-functioning base and purchase a brand-new unit.  So beware, if you put your hard-earned dollars into this expensive product, it may only last three years and the manufacturer will not lift a finger to ensure you get the impression that this is just a buy and throw-away product.  Based on this experience we have no desire to invest in another Sonicare product.</li>
    <li> When Consumer Reports gave Sonicare Elite its highest recommendation in December, 2003, I balked at the price, but found one on sale at Target.  This spring I took it on 3 two-week trips, and it worked until I returned home to recharge it.  I have stored it on the charging base, as directed, and only now is the battery showing its age.  I am trying to \\&quot;train\\&quot; it off the base, to retain its charge, but the warning buzz kicks in after about 5 days. &lt;br /&gt;Even so, that&#x27;s impressive longevity.  How many electric products can you use twice-a-day for 3 1/2 years without replacing them?  &lt;br /&gt;We are so satisfied with this product that we don&#x27;t flinch at the price of the replacement heads.  If we&#x27;re vigilant, we can find &#x27;em on-sale several times a year.   &lt;br /&gt;If this is my handle&#x27;s Swan Song, I won&#x27;t think twice before paying over $100 for a new one.</li>
    <li> I was sold by the Sonic toothbrush ad frequently shown on TV and after juggling between the few different brands out there, eventually I picked up the Philips Sonicare 7300. The result is noticable, especially to my dentist. He did compliment on the product and mention how most of his sonic toothbrush patients have comparably cleaner gum/teeth, but of course, that could just mean that people who use these ivory toothbrushs do care more about their oral hygiene than others. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s simply no complaint about the toothbrush at all except maybe the cost. The system itself is quite expensive as well as the replacement head. I do appreciate the pause on the timer that it breaks each session into 4 equal times meant for the bottom/upper/inner/outer side of the teeth but I usually use two or three sessions each time brushing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately one day the brush just stop charging and no matter how long it is left on the charger it simply refuses to be charged. I was not sure of the culprit and I called up the Sonicare tech support. The tech support guys helped me reset it and told me to leave it on the set for 24+ hours to achieve a full charge. Didn&#x27;t help, still dead.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Since it is slightly after the 2 year warranty there would be no service. I called up 2 friends whom I recommended the Sonicare to, asking if I could borrow the charger to see if my toothbrush will charge on their charger. They both told me that the tooth brush went dead at around the same time, a little bit later than the warranty ends. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At this point I am still not sure on whether to get a new one or not because of this coincidence, I also like to know if there are other users who had or not had the same problem. Maybe some Mean Time Before Failure? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As an alternative I am also considering this new toothbrush that claims to emit ultrasonic waves while brushing, which was featured on the Pop Sci magazine...</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace my Teledyne Sensonic toothbrush which broke.  The Sensonic uses a similar high-speed vibration technology, but an entirely different mechanical design.  The Sonicare design provides much more power and durability.  The part that broke on my Sensonic is an integral part of the brush head on the Sonicare, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about that anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had used the Sensonic to help control a minor periodontal condition.  When it broke, after a year of manual brushing I was in bad shape with the Dentist.  The dental tech recommended this unit, and after using it for a few months, I returned to the Dentist and was given a very positive diagnosis.  It really helped improve the health of my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this unit to anyone with recurring periodontal issues.  This thing really works.</li>
    <li> This brush is a replacement for the Oral B brush I was using. This brush gets your teeth cleaner then the Oral B. I would recommend this brush to everyone. My dentist recommends Sonicare tooth brush and so do I.</li>
    <li> I was using Oral B for 3 years and switched to sonicare just to try something different. I think sonicare is better because of different motion than oral b. Well both are good brushes than manual brushing. I would choose sonicare. I hate to see it because Oral B served me good. Sorry if I am confusing you more.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sister for Christmas. She likes the \\&quot;out of the dentists office\\&quot; feeling. It&#x27;s fast and good quality. I personally think it&#x27;s too expensive for a toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This was my first electric toothbrush and after only two weeks of using it coffee stains are gone and my teeth are getting whiter every day.  The Quad-Pacer (or whatever it is called) is a must and makes brushing your teeth much more consistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charger stand has a small foot print and the tooth brush already lasted a 3 day weekend at the ski hill without the charger.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never use another toothbrush again!  I love that it runs on a segmented timer to keep me honest about the time I spend brushing.    It will tickle your nose a bit at first, but you definitely get used to it, as you get used to the extreme clean it provides.</li>
    <li> Love it!  All sonicare power toothbrushes are amazing!  It leaves you feeling like you just came from the dentist!</li>
    <li> This is great. I look forward to brushing my teeth and am amazed at how good my mouth feels after using the brush each morning.</li>
    <li> This the third time we&#x27;ve purchased this product over the past six or seven years. It&#x27;s a great product, does a great job of preventing decay and other tooth problems when used  twice a day as directed. It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it in the long run. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Here are two things Phillips will not tell you about their Sonicare toothbrushes and heads.     1) The collar that holds the toothbrush to the handle will disintegrate in a couple of months. That&#x27;s what prompted this review, because they would not replace mine after it fell apart two weeks after purchasing a replacement.     They manufacturer these things to disintegrate so you will continue to buy replacements - planned obsolescence. However, I suspect their China supplier is skimping on the plastic specifications and they fall apart in weeks instead of months. (Do you think China would really do that?)    2) UNPLUG your base until you need to charge the toothbrush.  If you charge it up overnight, then unplug the base, the toothbrush will work for four brushings per day for about a month.  Then, when it signals or stops, plug the base in to charge it.     This method will allow your toothbrush to work for five years or longer. If you keep the base plugged in all the time, these NiCad batteries develop memory and will stop functioning after 18 to 24 months.    A bonus, if you travel a lot as I do, you don&#x27;t have to pack the charger.  Just make sure it&#x27;s topped off and you&#x27;re good for a month&#x27;s vacation.</li>
    <li> Ever since receiving my Philips Sonicare Elite 7300 toothbrush for Christmas a couple of years ago, I have come to expect great products from the Philips Corporation. I had expressed to my parents that I wanted a good electric toothbrush because I feel that taking care of my teeth is extremely important. I have never had a cavity or any other sort of problems with my teeth and I was not ready to start. After I got my new toothbrush, my mom expressed to me the importance of taking care of it because it was pricey for \\&quot;just a toothbrush.\\&quot; My cousin Jenny, who is in her second year in dental school, said that buying a Sonicare toothbrush was the best thing you could do for your teeth as recommended by her professors and colleagues, so my mom thought that I might as well try it and be the guinea pig of the family.    I am so glad that I got this specific toothbrush because no regular toothbrush gives me the cleanliness feeling that my Sonicare toothbrush gives me after brushing. After using the Sonicare 7300, my friends and family have all said my teeth look brighter and whiter. I know I haven&#x27;t changed my toothpaste (Colgate Total...also recommended by my cousin), so it must be the toothbrush. The thing I love most about my Sonicare is that I don&#x27;t have to brush hard. With regular toothbrushes, I would apply too much force that all my bristles would bend outwards. With this toothbrush, it&#x27;s really difficult to apply a lot of pressure on the toothbrush because it&#x27;s already vibrating so much. The force is about 10x the regular Crest and Oral-B brushes they sell in the stores. My dentist has even commented on how the receding of my gumline has stopped. Brushing with the Sonicare 7300 is like brushing with a new toothbrush everyday.   I also love the fact that the toothbrush has the quad pacer. This feature tells you to switch to a different region in your mouth (i.e. top front, top back, bottom front, bottom back). The fact that I don&#x27;t have to waste money on batteries for my toothbrush since the Sonicare comes with a rechargeable battery is also an advantage. The toothbrush heads&#x27; bristles are curved to get in-between your teeth and to clean the surface of a tooth. After brushing with the Sonicare 7300, I like to pass my tongue across the front and back of all my teeth and it feels like I just got my teeth cleaned by a hygienist. In addition, the noise of the Sonicare is less audible than other electric toothbrushes, so I don&#x27;t worry about waking up my roommates when I brush my teeth before bed.   The only thing that I dislike about my Sonicare Elite 7300 is that water gets collected on the inside part of the handle and if you don&#x27;t detach your brush and dry it out or clean it out, it could start to smell or get hard water stains. I have learned that cleaning it out with vinegar fixes the problem. Also, if you&#x27;re the type of person that likes to see your teeth while you&#x27;re brushing, the vibration force of the brush will cause you to get speckles of toothpaste to fly on your mirror, which is a huge pet-peeve of my moms. To fix this, I simply don&#x27;t brush with my mouth open or without my lips enclosed on my Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for several years and my gum problems are no more. My dental hygienist can really tell the difference. Since my dental health improved so much and so quickly, my husband also got one and he&#x27;s very happy too. I&#x27;d NEVER go back to using a regular toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Lasted a little over a year.  I tried to follow the instructions to replace the battery on my own but it&#x27;s honestly almost impossible to get the battery without destroying your toothbrush... which I did.  It&#x27;s ridiculous.  If you&#x27;re going to make a battery operated toothbrush, you should make the battery  easily accessible to people.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  One of the cheaper brands will work just fine.</li>
    <li> Love it for 6 years.  Top notch wonderful for keeping the kids brushing.  Keep it up Soincare for us all</li>
    <li> Glad I made the switch to Sonicare. I have had this model over 2 years and it still works like new. My teeth feel great and I have not been getting any cavities.</li>
    <li> I bought several of those inexpensive spinbrushes when they came out and I have to admit, my teeth felt much cleaner then when using a regular brush. Two things spurred me to get the Sonicare. The first was my dentist had an operation and is out of the picture for a couple of months, right when its time to get a cleaning. The second is I have bad insurance and its hard finding a dentist that takes it, or one that will clean and examine your teeth during one visit. I had seen the commerical and decided to give it a try. I noticed whiter teeth in 2 days!!! No lie. I am using a whitening toothpaste with it, but it is the same toothpaste I have been using for months. My mouth feels like when you leave the dentist, except for the tartar build up around the inside of my lower front teeth. But, its only been a week so far so I&#x27;ll see what happens. I will get my teeth cleaned next month and I know it will be much easier then if I was still using my spinbrush.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this model from a recommendation of friend/dentist after being quite unhappy with another electric toothbrush purchase. Even after the first night of usage, I noticed a difference in the cleanliness of my teeth.    My kids, who both have a mouthful of braces, use this toothbrush as well and both love it. Their orthodontist has even made comments on how clean their teeth were. That&#x27;s enough to make any parent happy.</li>
    <li> My husband is \\&quot;Mr. Picky\\&quot; when it comes to toothbrushes.  He likes this one so well that all the others have been trashed and his professional dental cleanings are much less painful and less frequent.  If he could build a savings account as fast as he builds plaque, we&#x27;d be very comfortable indeed.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t own one of these, you should.  I bought the Advance 4700 for my son and I tried it.  OH MY!!!! I&#x27;m hooked!  The only negative was the brush head and handle was considerably larger than the Elite 7300.  I see the price has dropped on the 4300 to around $79. A friend has the 7300 and the ergonomic design of the handle and skinner brush head makes it really much more comfortable.  But on the other hand, some people like larger things stuck in their mouth, so it that&#x27;s the case, go for the $20 savings and get the 4300.  All I can say is, I want to go brush my teeth right now.  You won&#x27;t be sorry with either!</li>
    <li> At first I thought that maybe spending $100 on a toothbrush seemed liked a lot, but then I realized that these are my teeth and I want to have them forever. I&#x27;ve only used the brush for a couple days but I already love it. I had a problem with over-brushing before but now with this new Sonicare I can barely feel the brush on my teeth, but my teeth feel really really clean afterwards. The brushheads are a little expensive but if you&#x27;re only replacing them every 6 months, it&#x27;s really not that big of a deal.</li>
    <li> If bad teeth run in your family, you are prone to cavities or lax in your dental care, you absolutely need one of these and you will save hundreds of dollars in the long run. You&#x27;d be wise to purchase one if your kids are rather lax in their care, eat candy (even if they have to sneak to the neighbors&#x27; house to get it) and need to be watched like a hawk to get them to brush regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, if you can fall asleep for days on end without brushing and emerge without a cavity or sore gums, you may get by with plain, old-fashioned brushing and flossing, even if you forget a time or two. Perhaps you&#x27;ve got strong teeth. If so, I envy you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My family, however, needs all the help it can get, with teeth that decay easily, even if we avoid sweets. With the latest research indicating that tooth decay raises one&#x27;s risk of HEART disease, this item may truly be a lifesaver, not just a way to stave off cavities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For us, the purchase of this has paid off handsomely in the long run. We now emerge from dental appointments without a long list of cavities in need of fillings and there is no plaque on our teeth (most of the time). It has truly helped a great deal. It does more than we can do ourselves and I say that as someone who flossed and brushed regularly. Even so, I got cavities. After buying this, I haven&#x27;t had one in ages. I was skeptical. I am skeptical no longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is pricey, but far less costly than lots of fillings, root canals, bridges, etc. If your parents have dentures and they aren&#x27;t particularly old, take heed...and get thee to a store NOW and purchase this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to have my original teeth as long as possible. Maybe you feel the same. If so, this is a wise investment.</li>
    <li> Our dentist recommended sonicare toothbrushes years ago and we&#x27;ve been using them ever since.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the toothbrush, its easy to use and I love the \\&quot;timer\\&quot; aspect.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is great, it is like goning to the Dentist evry day. My old regular toothbrush did not clean my teeth half as good. You can really see the difference, If you smoke the yellow starts to fade away. It IS Great.</li>
    <li> PROS: Sonicare cleans better than manual brushing... and requires less wrist/hand movement. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;CONS: $$</li>
    <li> dont get the  \\&quot;Better Together\\&quot; &lt;br /&gt;     Buy this item with Sonicare Advance (A-Series) Replacement Brush Head, Standard (2-Pack) by Sonicare today!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The heads are the A-Series which dont work with the version.  Only the E-Series works.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now im told i need to wait for MARKETING to get back to me about this.  So i guess i will need to waite for MARKETING then another 10 days to get it replaced.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Learn from my mistake. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for two years, and have been very happy with it. It was recommended by a dentist, and despite the expense, I am not sorry I splurged. The brush provides a professional cleaning every time you brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised there aren&#x27;t more complaints from users on how the brushhead&#x27;s design traps toothpaste and mouth gunk (yuck!) inside its plastic shell- which can&#x27;t be totally taken apart enough to get at the inner workings. Everyone is oohing and ahhing over the toothbrush&#x27;s great performance (I don&#x27;t disagree at all) but seem to overlook the poor design of the brushhead that allows gunk to build up quickly - even with a reasonably thorough \\&quot;cleaning\\&quot; following Sonicare&#x27;s recommendations. They say nothing in the cleaning instructions on how to get into the areas beyond reach in the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping the Elite series  would have improved on the older Advance series design that was hard to keep clean but not so. I don&#x27;t know about most people but I wouldn&#x27;t put something near my mouth festering with bacteria and black mold. I rinse the brushhead, wipe it as dry as I can and remove it from the handle  after each use to air dry- but it isn&#x27;t watertight so despite best efforts stuff will get into the inner part of the brush/magnet unit that is factory sealed (I&#x27;m not talking about the removable threaded part that screws into the handle). I have ended up taking apart the factory sealed part by bending the plastic tabs and giving the inner parts a good hot water bath and scrubbing with a q-tip. But the unit obviously isn&#x27;t designed for the user to easily do this.  Maybe Sonicare figures their customers will be discarding the brushhead in 3-6 months or whatever they recommend so no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what you pay for the unit this is a major design flaw IMO. They need to design a totally sealed brushhead- why can&#x27;t they use o-rings, rubber gaskets or a tighter rubber/vinyl boot like they use now to keep the brushhead sealed but still leave it flexible to vibrate?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh I laughed at the one negative review of the travel case- I use that a lot and the reviewer is super-picky. It&#x27;s sturdy and latches fine and the plastic in the hinges is made to benda lot. The carry case will outlast the toothbrush if they only last a few years like many people are saying. (&amp;lt;:</li>
    <li> Like the older Sonicare line, this does a great job of cleaning your teath.  The smaller head and narrower neck make it easier to maneuver about the mouth.  The handle is a bit smaller which makes it easier to handle.  Battery lasts about 8 days in normal use (2 times a day). It has a nice \\&quot;learning\\&quot; feature that starts the brush out at a fairly gentle aggitation and moves to the most vigorous level over the course of 15 day to give the novice user a chance to acclimate to the vibrating head (it can tickle quite a bit if you&#x27;re not used to it).  The charging stand is minimal so it takes up little room on the sink.  I wish they would have included a brush stand to hold the brush head when it&#x27;s not on the handle. Make sure you clean the head and the handle at least weekly. I find there is buildup in the brush \\&quot;nut\\&quot; (that screws onto the handle) and the handle . The handle has lots of little crevices where gunk can accumulate. Sounds funny but running the brush head through the dishwasher monthly seems to work.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Sonicare toothbrush for many years and am pleased with the results (though I recommend that you not press too hard as it may damage your enamel over time). My gripe is that they couldn&#x27;t figure out that the brush head does not seal well to the unit. This quickly causes a gunk build up in both the base of the brush head and the power unit. It is almost impossible to get it into all the crevices to clean it thoroughly even with Qtips and other implements. Eventually, you see mold and bacteria developing and this is not sanitary.  I don&#x27;t know if the Oral B product is designed more effectively but I&#x27;m going to check.</li>
    <li> i bought this product since i constantly had gum problems (my gums used to bleed at times) and all the other reviews were right, it is a great product. my mouth feels super clean after brushing and my gums have hardly ever bled since i started using this. but i am not sure whether it really whitens the teeth, i don&#x27;t notice much of a difference there.  is it worth the high price? if you have a great set of teeth and never had problems using regular toothbrushes, you might not find great value in this. but otherwise, it is a very valuable toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Excellent product this is my second one I purchased, had the older model for 4 years.</li>
    <li> The Elite e7300 is my second Sonicare toothbrush (6 1/2 years until the first couldn&#x27;t be recharged).  My dentist and I agree that Sonicare product use improves dental health, making regular checkups &amp; cleaning a minor event (compared to previous de-scaling and stain removal sessions).  Two minutes is more than enough to complete a thorough brushing.  Ease of use encourages more frequent brushing.  Important to remember that even a Sonicare is not a substitute for flossing into the deep gaps between teeth.  One suggestion for users:  Invest in a roll of white teflon (plumber&#x27;s) tape to wrap the threads where the brush assembly screws into the handle.  This precaution prevents water intrusion and potential corrosion of the electrical contacts.</li>
    <li> This is the best toothbrush ever.  Your teeth feel like you just got home from the dental hygienist -- every day.</li>
    <li> Performs way above what I expected! I thought that the bells and whistle timer functions would be a waist of time (pun not intended) but they really help to keep you aware of what you are doing and where you are doing it.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had two Sonicare Elite 7300 toothbrushes over the last 4 years.  Sonicare works great and cleans your teeth well.  It is a bit bulky, noisy and vibrates a lot but you get used to that.  If you don&#x27;t remove the brush head from the base after each use to clean the interior mold starts to build.  Not good.    Besides, both Sonicare units I owned had the same problem.  After around 18 months the battery took less and less of a charge until after around 26 months I could only brush my teeth 4 to 5 times per charge.  Big problem if you travel a lot or when several people use the same base.  I called Sonicare about it and was told the base should last for up to 5 years.  Whatever, the warranty is only two years.    So I looked at other products and found the Oral B S-320 Sonic Complete system.  The base is made by Braun in Germany.  I have owned 4 Braun electric shavers over the past 24 years.  The last one still worked fine when I replaced it 5 years ago but I wanted to upgrade to the new Activator.  So my experience with Braun products \\&quot;made in Germany\\&quot; and their reliability had been very good.    The Oral B S-320 Sonic Complete is lighter than the Sonicare Elite.  The Oral B toothbrush head is designed a bit different than the Sonicare.  After using the Oral B now for about 2 month I have the feeling that the Oral B cleans my teeth better and I think it is due to the difference in toothbrush design.      The Oral B sits essentially on a vibrating stick vs. the screw cap method used by Sonicare.  The vibrating stick seems better from a hygiene standpoint and creates a similar amount of vibration.    Another big difference between both systems is the cost of the brush heads.  3 replacement heads for Oral B Sonic Complete are $18 on Amazon; 2 brush heads for the Sonicare system are between $23 and $28 on Amazon.  Since the price for the base systems is similar the savings from the toothbrushes for the Oral B is quite substantial, especially if several people are using the system.    Overall, I am very pleased with the Oral B system and even my dentist thinks there is no difference in terms of effectiveness between both systems.  Based on my experience with the Braun shavers I am hopeful the Oral B will last longer than the Sonicare.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my new Sonicare toothbrush.  It is a replacement for an older model that has worn out.  It was delivered ahead of the anticipated delivery date.</li>
    <li> This was $15 cheaper than where I normally shop at the Army Air Force Ecxhange and shipping was free.  No gas involved!  It came real quick and I love it more than the first two I had.</li>
    <li> This is my second Elite, my other lasted 6 years of everyday use by two people. This brush dramatically improved my oral hygiene. I only wish it was available when I was younger. I&#x27;d recommened the Sonicare to anyone.</li>
    <li> I convinced my husband that this toothbrush would make a perfectly acceptable Mother&#x27;s Day gift...in 2002. My husband and I used this brush 5-6 times per day for 7 years and it finally gave its last performance. Some electronic part beneath the power button finally broke and it would no longer turn off.    I will replace this brush with another Sonicare toothbrush (am still investigating which model). I have been extremely happy with Sonicare&#x27;s cleaning results (we even bought our children the Essence model).     I have a lower brace that tends to collect plaque and my gums would easily bleed at the dentist&#x27;s office. Since using the Sonicare daily, I do not have as much build up and my gums don&#x27;t bleed during dental visits.    Another plus: The battery stays charged for at least 7 days, so for any trip shorter than a week, we would not even pack the charger.    I know that the expense puts this toothbrush out of reach for many people. However, once you commit to the expense, it is well worth the money. I believe that it has increased my dental &amp; gum health, which is worth a lot to me.</li>
    <li> It was a good product but only had a life of 18 mos. At a top of the line price, I expected more.  Won&#x27;t be fooled again.</li>
    <li> We owned the original Sonicare for years and we loved it.  When we bought this model, we expected the same good performance we had from the original.  We were sorely disappointed by the fact that the screw on brush heads were flimsy and didn&#x27;t screw down on the base unit securely.  We found the transfer of the ultra-sonic vibrations were dampened by the fact that the brush heads didn&#x27;t remain tightly connected to the base unit.  After using this model for a year, we were receiving negative feedback from our dental hygienist.  We ended up buying another brand of electronic toothbrush but still weren&#x27;t getting the results we expected.  Finally bought the Sonicare Flexcare model with snap on style heads.  This model works beautifully.  I would recommend you NOT buy Sonicare products with screw on style brush heads as they continuously loosen themselves from the base unit which degrades their performance.  The snap on style heads available on some Sonicare models remain securely attached to the base unit and therefore, transfer the ultrasonic vibrations to the brush head and your teeth more effectively.</li>
    <li> The tooth brush has been used for over a year with no problems.  The 30 second timer does a great job of letting a user know when to move the brush.</li>
