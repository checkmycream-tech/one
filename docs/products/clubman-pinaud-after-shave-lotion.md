      <li>It&#x27;s refreshing, and a good value.</li>
      <li>Good refreshing feel after a shave.  </li>
      <li>It smells nice, but can be overpowering unlike the vanilla.</li>
      <li>Nice fragrance.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quite nice-</li>
      <li>Nice.</li>
      <li>and then you kind of like it...</li>
      <li>There is alcohol, so you get a nice burn.</li>
      <li>This is absolutely the best aftershave I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>This stuff is really, really nice.</li>
      <li>Nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>&quot;  I still liked it.  </li>
      <li>Is it popular with senior citizens?</li>
      <li>/&gt;Would make a nice Xmas gift for the man in your life</li>
      <li>When splashing it on it invigorates you after shaving and has a sauve, gentlemanly, scent all of its own.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve always walked my own path.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a nice sting to it, after splashing on after a close shave.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this based on good reviews on Amazon but didnt find it that interesting that I&#x27;ll buy it again</li>
      <li>Nice feel when you apply it to your face after the shave.</li>
      <li>It may be that it has become popular and to fill the orders they&#x27;ve diluted the formula.</li>
      <li>Most say that it smells so good that they want to buy some for their husbands.&lt;br</li>
      <li>A great smell that is cheaper than most of the most popular blends.</li>
      <li>The smell is kind of old-school which he likes</li>
      <li>she purchased for me because she liked the way it smelled.</li>
      <li>The best part, it is inexpensive and very blue-collaresque</li>
      <li>Feels nice on</li>
      <li>It is nice smelling like a man.</li>
      <li>A nice, inexpensive alternative to cologne.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I think all of the Clubman products are great at soothing your face after a shave, better than most</li>
      <li>Smells nice and manly.</li>
      <li>I have always loved the smell of this brand and continue to love it clients love it and gives them that fresh out of the barber shop smell and feel awesome product</li>
      <li>The best way I found to find out what this really smells like if you&#x27;re unsure what you&#x27;ll smell like to others</li>
      <li>Tweezerman badger shave brush, C.O. Bigelow (Proraso) shave cream and VDH Deluxe</li>
      <li>Has a nice bite to it with the alcohol in it.</li>
      <li>I honestly couldn&#x27;t resist--I leaned into him and said, \\&quot;Is</li>
      <li>Kind of like you just did</li>
      <li>I imagined dozens of cute Bettys coming out of the trees and bumps, crowding around him, sniffing his chest and shoulders, and oohing and ahhing about how good he smelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But my Dad liked it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found this to be an effective way to wake me up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and it seems to leave my skin feeling fairly nice after the burning has subsided.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d prefer a nice bottle of bay rum or mentholated aftershave over this any day.</li>
      <li>Smells nice too</li>
      <li>Proraso and Colonel Conk make wonderful, very affordable soaps.)</li>
      <li>Outstanding smell and superior feel after shave with DE razor.  </li>
      <li>Smells like the kind your grandpa had.</li>
      <li>and i would have to apply my own moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I mix it with witch hazel and some lotion to make a really nice aftershave balm.  </li>
      <li>This aftershave feels really nice on my skin, however the scent just isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
      <li>I was very close to my grandfather, so anything that reminds me of him is wonderful.</li>
      <li>commented on how nice the aroma was.</li>
      <li>Absolutely the best after shave</li>
      <li>It leaves a nice scent on his skin.</li>
      <li>Nice smell</li>
      <li>, it smells straight up awesome, the burn makes you feel like a man.</li>
      <li>purchase having used Clubman products before &amp; liked them.</li>
      <li>Nice lingering smell.</li>
      <li>I loved it, will reorder for sure.</li>
      <li>Wow...this stuff is nice.  </li>
      <li>honestly, it smells a bit like some sort of baby product.  </li>
      <li>Smells nice, rolls on easy.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Bought this as a gift…not sure if it&#x27;s good.  </li>
      <li>Design is nice .  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a quality aftershave that would soothe my burning skin and make me smell nice.</li>
      <li>I liked this product but my wife hates it.</li>
      <li>just nice.  </li>
      <li>The smell of my razor is really nice.</li>
      <li>It has a nice scent, but it&#x27;s rather overpowering.  </li>
      <li>smell nice .Is</li>
      <li>Smells good, does a good job of soothing the skin after a clean shave</li>
      <li>Great after shave;  might be the original for all I know.  </li>
      <li>So this is the original After shave lotion!!  </li>
      <li>Smells great, gives that great light burn, and heals sking quick.</li>
      <li>Love the sting of a nice alcohol based after shave in the morning - smells like VICTORY! :)</li>
      <li>Smells great, skin feels pretty good with it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not to strong and gives a nice sting after a good close</li>
      <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with this product, and I will look into more Pinaud products because of it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very nice clean and musky smell.</li>
      <li>Great scent but seems to fade quickly.</li>
      <li>Great mild smell reminds me of Canoe.</li>
      <li>Comes on strong with a good burn.</li>
      <li>This aftershave is very strong.</li>
      <li>The scent starts off very strong.</li>
      <li>Soothing, but has a very strong scent.</li>
      <li>Very strong fragrance and dries out my skin.  </li>
      <li>Impressed with it so far</li>
      <li>Good cheap aftershave.</li>
      <li>This is nice, I ordered it off Amazon because everything in the store has so many ingredients.  </li>
      <li>Brush on that old school shaving soap with the perfect brush.</li>
      <li>Goes perfectly with 100+ year old razors.</li>
      <li>Just an all around great, fresh, relaxing feel &amp; aroma.</li>
      <li>Excellent stuff old time Barber Shop.</li>
      <li>Great after shave lotion makes your skin feel fresh.</li>
      <li>cmon anyone remember this as  young kid at the barber shop, its the greatest</li>
      <li>I think this may be my best so far as scent.</li>
      <li>I wish there was a cologne with this scent, because I really do love it, but it&#x27;s just not that effective as an aftershave.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely an old man smell, but in the best way.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s even more amazing.</li>
      <li>Best amongst all the after shave lotion I have used so far.</li>
      <li>just confirmed to me that I was on to a good thing....</li>
      <li>Nice scent good price fast shipping good seller</li>
      <li>The best way I can think of to describe the smell of Axe, and alot of these new cologne&#x27;s and sprays out there is to paraphrase one of my favorite songs and say \\&quot;Boy</li>
      <li>if it bombs I don&#x27;t have to suffer all day with it).&lt;br /&gt;After the alcohol flashed off and the essence warmed on my skin the most pleasant aroma filled the room, but not overpowering.</li>
      <li>You get a plastic bottle, but who cares (surely a glass one would be more stylish)!</li>
      <li>The smell is a pleasant one, so it&#x27;s not bad if it is anyway.</li>
      <li>A good clean smell, without being overpowering or cloying.</li>
      <li>The scent of this aftershave is great, and the alcohol provides a great antiseptic quality that kills any bacteria that may be left from the shave.  </li>
      <li>After it dries, it leaves my skin good and clean.</li>
      <li>The Clubman Pinaud aftershave has a good, clean, manly smell;</li>
      <li>Good clean feel after applying.</li>
      <li>Good, clean feel and smell; doesn&#x27;t overpower the room, but my wife likes it.  </li>
      <li>This has a very strong and refreshing scent.</li>
      <li>No, I don&#x27;t wear it, but I buy it, and I know of no other aftershave that smells as delicious as Clubman.</li>
      <li>good product I like the original stronger scent better,</li>
      <li>this aftershave was exactly what I wanted I would recommended this product to anyone, it is soothing when applied after shaving and smells great</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cool n smells good.</li>
      <li>It burns at first, but leaves the skin very smooth and smells great</li>
      <li>Love this, a good clean sent.</li>
      <li>smells pretty nice - sort of like Brut, not as bright but soapier/cleaner scent.</li>
      <li>So a good after shaved seemed a worthy product to try, and it works.  </li>
      <li>Great positive reviews.</li>
      <li>This product leaves your face feeling clean and refreshed after a shave and is especially good at preventing irritation / redness and does a decent job at coagulating the blood of any nicks you may have.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Got to love an aftershave that says flammable on the label.</li>
      <li>I love the sting.</li>
      <li>Clubman makes me skydive better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>I like a bay rum after shave better</li>
      <li>Famous product used by barbers for over a century.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s awesome in the sent last all day</li>
      <li>that was because it leaked most of it&#x27;s contents while in the shipping process.  </li>
      <li>oh and i love it too.</li>
      <li>I am 22-years-old and I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Gives you confidence and makes you feel more dignified; almost puts a bounce in your step.</li>
      <li>too many shirts have been sold.  </li>
      <li>This timeless barbershop smell creates just that smell and is even better when paired with [[ASIN:B0007MW2ZW</li>
      <li>but I love this product.</li>
      <li>I use this at night before bed and in the mornings, the scent lingers but is mostly gone (thankfully).</li>
      <li>I will by more when this is gone.</li>
      <li>Stick to the basics -- there&#x27;s a reason most barbers use this stuff.</li>
      <li>Smells OK.</li>
      <li>I would buy again for sure, but will have to wait until wife has lost sense of smell.</li>
      <li>another product I have used for many years, was alway a favorite at the barber shop.  </li>
      <li>I really love this stuff.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s made of plastic (ok, cheaper) and it doesn&#x27;t travel well.  </li>
      <li>My wife likes the smell and I received many complements.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is... ok.</li>
      <li>one more thing, it leaves a touch like a powder on the skin with smooooooth touch.</li>
      <li>, I remember this smell SO well from my childhood, worn by all of my favorite men.  </li>
      <li>The price is outstanding and it&#x27;s something he can wear at any age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Except women shouldn&#x27;t be shaving their faces and if they are, they have a lot more to worry about than aftershave.</li>
      <li>Today most men get their hair cut in places with the words Uni or Clips in their names.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t like most scents.  </li>
      <li>This has become on of my favorite aftershaves.  </li>
      <li>Guess what I get the most compliments on when I wear them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this for over 30 years, I am glad people are still discovering it.</li>
      <li>More of a nostalgia item for me.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had many compliments from many women while wearing it, and for me that counts for more than all the advertising money can buy.</li>
      <li>Really Stingy and smells great.</li>
      <li>I will definately be buying more when he runs out.</li>
      <li>Thanks for a great product.</li>
      <li>but in time I&#x27;m sure they will.</li>
      <li>Bravo Zulu to Clubman for not changing their formula in a day when so many are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Mostly all barbers use this brand.  </li>
      <li>Nothing more</li>
      <li>I read the wonderful reviews and so I went to my local CVS Pharmacy and picked up a bottle.  </li>
      <li>and then you love it</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>The powder is much better.</li>
      <li>My wife made a comment also about how potent the smell was.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t feel this was the most manly after shave</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what my wife would think but she complimented me on the scent.</li>
      <li>Sure.</li>
      <li>This is not my absolute favorite fragrance (Muelhen&#x27;s 4711 is my very favorite), and its not my very favorite Pinaud product (I like the Vanilla Clubman even better)</li>
      <li>but I love this stuff</li>
      <li>Not a lot of burn, and it really does have a great smell.</li>
      <li>And damned if I don&#x27;t love this aftershave.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got more than my share of gray hair already, but</li>
      <li>i love the scent of this.</li>
      <li>Refreshing.</li>
      <li>Love the refreshing smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>My wife likes it better than the bottle of [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>I love the way this smells on my husband.</li>
      <li>With a product that&#x27;s been around for 200 years, can you find a better recommendation?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad this is not a mainstream product</li>
      <li>My favorite aftershave fragrance of all time.</li>
      <li>I was expecting the scent to linger most of the day.  </li>
      <li>But I do not feel any better than after I used Geo Trumper  Coral Skin Food  </li>
      <li>This is the lotion that was used in barbar shops when he was ayoung man and it has not changed in 80 years or more.</li>
      <li>It is your favorite barbershop in a bottle.</li>
      <li>It was just an OK lotion.</li>
      <li>I love the scent.</li>
      <li>The bottle is also made of plastic so safe to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is the scent I use most often.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I got this,</li>
      <li>They can also work well as colognes if you&#x27;re not one to spend the buck on &amp;#34;flower water&amp;#34; like many.</li>
      <li>Love everything about this aftershave but the container.</li>
      <li>He really likes this shave lotion, and I think it smells great.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this lotion.  </li>
      <li>If you love that old-time barbershop smell of talc, you will love this product.  </li>
      <li>OK, if you say so dear.  </li>
      <li>Bought this product to help with my razor burn and bumps, and after all of my skepticism I am really glad that I decided to purchase this after shave.</li>
      <li>I came across this while looking for something else and remembered this as my favorite aftershave</li>
      <li>I use the talc every night - just love the scent.  </li>
      <li>I have both Pinaud and Proraso and I like Pinaud better.</li>
      <li>It smells better.</li>
      <li>I think about a cat litter box everytime I put it on  :)  </li>
      <li>I do like the fact that Proraso has more of a &amp;#34;lotiony&amp;#34; feel to it though.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff and so does my fiance.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love Clubman Pinaud</li>
      <li>You want to smell more grown up?</li>
      <li>and I doubt you could get more old-school than a brand that has been around for over 200 years.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the way this stuff smells</li>
      <li>I love the smell and the way it makes my face feel.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s more of a powder smell.</li>
      <li>That is probably why so many barbers swear by the stuff.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff and it is really refreshing.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love the smell of this stuff.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Hopefully you have better luck than I do.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love the smell.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell of this stuff.</li>
      <li>Seems to do ok as an after shave as in helping with razor burn...</li>
      <li>Smells like Grand Dad.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
      <li>bit too much alcohol for an &amp;#34;aftershave&amp;#34; (can sting, a lot), but the scent is great.</li>
      <li>This is my wife&#x27;s favorite product that I use.</li>
      <li>Absolutely LOVE the old-school smell of this stuff.</li>
      <li>so YOU won&#x27;t be able to smell</li>
      <li>A lot :)</li>
      <li>It works .. refreshing ..</li>
      <li>It will wake you up in the morning and smells much better than today&#x27;s after shave&#x27;s and cologne&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s FANTASTIC!</li>
      <li>Love the smell.  </li>
      <li>My assumption is that it&#x27;s made better by the memory I have associated with it</li>
      <li>Love this after shave.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
      <li>LOVE</li>
      <li>&quot; the handsome man with irresistible aromas emanating from his body said.</li>
      <li>The smell wasn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; as I had hoped it would be but it wasn&#x27;t overwhelming either.  </li>
      <li>It is easier on the skin than most aftershaves.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell of a barbershop</li>
      <li>I love the smell of Clubman aftershave.</li>
      <li>Get a brush, a single-blade double-edge razor (Merkur from Germany is a good place to start), some old school barber shop cream, like Proraso from Italy, and a good aftershave like this one.  </li>
      <li>Wait til you see how much better it all works.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love the way it feels and smells.</li>
      <li>I love Clubman Pinaud</li>
      <li>These products cost a bit more, but are dramatically better at soothing your skin after shaving.  </li>
      <li>I guess greatness costs 5 or 10 times more.</li>
      <li>A lumberjack would probably want something more manly.</li>
      <li>Now many on here claim this stuff burn like lava.</li>
      <li>I love the feel on my face when I splash it on.  </li>
      <li>My husband and I discovered this aftershave many, many years ago.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
      <li>I love the smell which is somewhere between, or a combination of barber shop, baby powder, and Dapper Dan.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>What more can I say?</li>
      <li>but that is a Strong/Overpowering scent which may not always be appropriate in all situations tho</li>
      <li>as I like to use this together with a dash of Eau De Quinine hair tonic if I need a dash of something just a bit stronger and have been complimented by ladies many times.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, Im sure I will be buying more of this Clubman.</li>
      <li>Perfect for after using a double edged safety razor - and if you&#x27;re not, you should.  </li>
      <li>Got it for the boyfriend and I love the smell</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the smell.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Now close your eyes and think about how good you feel with a fresh haircut and that glorious barbershop smell permeating your nostrils as you stroll out the door.  </li>
      <li>Too many women are now requiring it.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the Clubman Pinaud \\&quot;regular\\&quot; scent.</li>
      <li>It smells OK.</li>
      <li>always did love the smell of this after shave.</li>
      <li>This is some potent stuff.</li>
      <li>If you were to wear this stuff at work you would probably be accussed of sexual harassment as soon as you walked into a room.</li>
      <li>Instead, it&#x27;s more like a cleaning product or an herbal/natural bug repellant.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s probably the most like a skin conditioner.</li>
      <li>Its aloe vera plus I suspect witch hazel are what make me say it is most like a skin conditioner.</li>
      <li>I would say that Pinaud Clubman is the most astringent and cooling, followed by Proraso, Clubman&#x27;s Bay Rum, and Clubman&#x27;s Sandalwood.</li>
      <li>even if another after shave might help them heal better without your feeling anything.</li>
      <li>So, the more astringency the better for me.</li>
      <li>Smells OK, but wife did not care for it.</li>
      <li>Will definitely buy again with this superb price.</li>
      <li>I love this scent and now think of him whenever I smell it.</li>
      <li>I also use a cream style aftershave on top of this to soften skin sometimes.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s refreshing and invigorates in the morning.  </li>
      <li>the smell is still overwhelming after 20 minutes.  </li>
      <li>Smells great and really prevents razor burn.</li>
      <li>I like it, but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
      <li>It is an ok aftershave, and quite frankly, it is not something I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
      <li>Love the smell.</li>
      <li>Wife says she likes it better than the Proraso.</li>
      <li>It leaves my face cleaner and most, if not all, the tightness goes away.</li>
      <li>Perfect compliment to safety razor shaving for the ultimate barber shop shave.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t disagree more.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve become more and more OK with the smell</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this stuff.</li>
      <li>it is potent but reminds me of my grand pa.</li>
      <li>Like most after-shaves, though, you will feel the burn when it contacts any cuts or nicks you&#x27;ve given yourself shaving.</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>but I like the skin food products better for soothing.</li>
      <li>It does burn as all the reviews state but its not terrible.  </li>
      <li>This has a fabulous scent!  </li>
      <li>Brought back wonderful memories.  </li>
      <li>This aftershave has a nice understated fragrance that wont break the bank, Enjoy.</li>
      <li>Maybe woodsy, but not fireplace wood, more like walking through a forest.</li>
      <li>But not office suit and tie, more Bond like suit and tie.</li>
      <li>Anyone that grew up going to the Barbershop  will remember and love this smell.</li>
      <li>I could not be more satisfied.</li>
      <li>It does feel refreshing.</li>
      <li>this is the most valuable purchase i&#x27;ve made on amazon.</li>
      <li>factor in the low price, refreshing feeling, and perfect balance in fragrance</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used too many after shaves to compare it to, but it does the job for me.</li>
      <li>There is a refreshing burn when it covers your shaving nicks.</li>
      <li>here you go, this is the world famous scent.</li>
      <li>i love it, and it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
      <li>a refreshing, yet not overpowering manly smell.</li>
      <li>I love the way this makes my face feel.</li>
      <li>I love it .  </li>
      <li>many guys my age would care for.</li>
      <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
      <li>You better like the smell</li>
      <li>ordering more, love it</li>
      <li>Unlike most aftershaves and colognes, you must use soap and water to wash the scent off.</li>
      <li>it is how refreshing the feel and scent is.  </li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>My wife and kids love the smell of this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
      <li>and then you will understand why this is a top selling aftershave on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Said it was ok, but I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;ll be using it.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I love it though.</li>
      <li>I follow it with an aftershave balm to make sure the alcohol doesn&#x27;t dehydrate my face.</li>
      <li>These comments by Clubman users are hilarious.  </li>
      <li>I have always used many of the drug store aftershaves because i shave every day and go through allot of it.  </li>
      <li>and man i love it.  </li>
      <li>Will order some more when I run out.</li>
      <li>Not only is this the BEST after shave lotion I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend better than perfume coz of acne..</li>
      <li>but  many things in life that are oh</li>
      <li>i smell sucess T :)</li>
      <li>The nice things that I can say about Clubman are that it is good for your skin, and the price is very affordable.</li>
      <li>This is a very popular aftershave that I really wanted to like</li>
      <li>This is an oldtime scent that is clean and masculine and this lotion makes your skin feel great!</li>
      <li>Clubman Pinaud smells like nostalgia: warm, friendly, and pleasing.</li>
      <li>A very nice scent that reminds me of the olde-time barber shop smells when I was a boy, and haircuts were quick, cheap, and easy.</li>
      <li>It cools your face and has that great, classic, barber shop scent you&#x27;ll remember.  </li>
      <li>Attracts older an women like flys to fly paper.</li>
      <li>Smells great, classic scent.</li>
      <li>I was hoping it would have a nice clean smell to it ( maybe like Proraso shaving cream)</li>
      <li>It has a nice, clean, just came from the barber shop scent.</li>
      <li>it is just a classic man smell and is a great product for the price.</li>
      <li>I suspect this product has a high level of alcohol which is great for killing bacteria, but the sting irritates some of the customers.</li>
      <li>Feels good on the skin after shaving, essentially cured my ingrown hairs and breakouts after shaving and has a pleasant aroma.</li>
      <li>And I like the smell of it - very clean smelling.</li>
      <li>Has a very clean scent and cools the face.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like finding a great tasting wine that you&#x27;d normally have to pay $25 for $5.</li>
      <li>All Pinaud products are pretty good.</li>
      <li>I would say it&#x27;s a pretty good value at this price point.  </li>
      <li>If you shave with a brush, good shaving cream or soap (NOT FOAM OR GEL FROM A CAN, but something from a tube or tub, of which there are numerous options), and a good blade (honestly, old-school double-edged safety razors are far superior to so-called \\&quot;modern\\&quot; cartridge razors), and if you use skin food afterward, you&#x27;ll get the best shave possible.  </li>
      <li>My wife even commented that it was pretty good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s mellow, classic and something very nice to smell.</li>
      <li>Awesome classic barber scent and very soothing!</li>
      <li>This delightful concoction is to shaving as a fine vintage Cabernet is to French cuisine.</li>
      <li>Its unique and imported!</li>
      <li>He smiled a confident smile.</li>
      <li>love this stuff easy on my face</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK, but way too strong.</li>
      <li>Go easy to prevent sexual harassment lawsuits.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice, bracing, mildly astringent feel when applied after a shave.</li>
      <li>Not overpowering, just a nice scent and feels great after a double edge shave.</li>
      <li>Drop a couple ounces of your favorite cologne in equally cheap bottle and it may be better.</li>
      <li>I love the smell, more importantly, my girlfriend LOVES it too.  </li>
      <li>Old school scent, works great, I love it.</li>
      <li>love the smell, masculine scent smells like a barbershop, great product, fast shipping, good price</li>
      <li>It is inexpensive but has a good scent that holds up well, is not overpowering, and makes you smell fresh and clean.  </li>
      <li>Smells very good, and does last a while.</li>
      <li>Very good especially considering the price.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Feels very cool after applying this</li>
      <li>A classic is always better to go with than something that&#x27;s an overpriced &amp;#34;flavor-of-the-month.&amp;#34; This is the kind of aftershave for a gentleman who is keenly aware of his sartorial taste and wants to put his best foot forward.</li>
      <li>I purchased it for my boyfriend and found it to be nothing more than a cheap smelling cologne you would buy at the grocery store.</li>
      <li>This is a great old school scent.</li>
      <li>Then I lightly apply some more Clubman Pinaud.</li>
      <li>The scent is light and refreshing too.</li>
      <li>It stings going on and makes you puff up your chest as you walk out of the bathroom smelling like the man you fantasized becoming when you were a kid.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for that great old time barbershop smell, this is what you want.</li>
      <li>So far it&#x27;s been working out great.  </li>
      <li>This is a fantastic manly smell, that will be sure to turn heads and give any woman that hint of their father or grandfather smell.....</li>
      <li>For me the burn is great even with sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>So much so that I sometimes put it on before I go to sleep just to feel good with myself.</li>
      <li>If you take the top off and smell it right out of the bottle, yes, the scent is VERY strong.</li>
      <li>When it first arrived, I liked the scent, but I quickly realized that it was kind of overpowering.  </li>
      <li>For those who love a strong scent and aren&#x27;t deterred by alcohol based products, you&#x27;ll enjoy it.  </li>
      <li>I expected it to smell too strong and pungent, but it is just perfect in every way.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a great manly scent, and a nice feel that does not leave me feeling dry.  </li>
      <li>Nice pleasant throw back smell.</li>
      <li>That may not be fair but it really does smell like a strong version of Brut cologne.  </li>
      <li>And given that today most men wear aftershaves with ingredients like Patchouli and Ylang Ylang, Clubman becomes a unique smell that no one will find too overpowering.</li>
      <li>As other reviewers have said, this product is excellent.  </li>
      <li>Not a lot of sting, the fragrance alone brought back thousands of good memories!</li>
      <li>Not only is he famous, but he proudly wears 3 Wolf Moon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Others can smell it on you easily, so be cautious of the application amount.</li>
      <li>A spectacular and invigorating astringent, and the smell is straight from the most luxurious barber shop you can imagine.</li>
      <li>Beats out the over-priced after shaves easily.</li>
      <li>price is also a great benefit over the CC Bay Rum, coming in at nearly a third of the price for 50% more product (6 oz.</li>
      <li>price is also a great benefit over the CC Bay Rum, coming in at nearly a third of the price for 50% more product (6 oz.</li>
      <li>you face aftershave is required to help your skin heal its self to prevent blemish i love the clean sensation (and</li>
      <li>and I liked it so much I bought one for our son :-)</li>
      <li>as many of the reviewers have said, it does remind me of good old barber shop and has this manly smell that I don&#x27;t get from fancy deodorants or Cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It not only feels great, but the smell is just lovely.</li>
      <li>but the price made it easy to give it a try.</li>
      <li>It is not always easy to find in our town</li>
      <li>Holy cow this smells good!!!</li>
      <li>Not too strong.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is strong.</li>
      <li>Smells strong tho</li>
      <li>my wife complains about how strong the smell is, but after 5 mins it&#x27;s ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>wish I had known how strong it was, but that&#x27;s my fault for not reading the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will strongly recommend for an enemy, never to a friend.</li>
      <li>This is a strong smell by the way.</li>
      <li>Some seem to think its quite strong in that regard</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t, I think its moderately strong.</li>
      <li>I recommend this product for anyone looking to replace strong and overpowering colognes.</li>
      <li>it does smell quite strong at times, and some people might not like the scent.</li>
      <li>Some reviewers here complain about the strong smell...</li>
      <li>strong manly aroma.</li>
      <li>The scent is noticable from close distance, but is not so strong that everyone in a 100&#x27; area of you will notice.</li>
      <li>Strong smell, perhaps too strong, but it gives you that barbershop feel when you are done shaving.  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s not so strong.</li>
      <li>This is way too strong a fragrance.  </li>
      <li>However, the smell is just too strong.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t find the fragnance as strong as it has been made in the reviews.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not over-powering or too strong.</li>
      <li>It does contain alcohol, but it didn&#x27;t make the scent too strong.  </li>
      <li>This is a good old school aftershave, reminds me of the barber shop for sure.</li>
      <li>My girlfriend doesn&#x27;t like the smell because it comes off too strong.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is not too strong</li>
      <li>I liked it very much and would recommend to anyone.</li>
      <li>first I was worried that the smell would be too strong, even though I liked it a lot.</li>
      <li>Best damn aftershave ever with a great masculine fragrance (not cheap smell).</li>
      <li>The smell is pretty nice</li>
      <li>Oh and the best part is this stuff is extremely inexpensive and widely available.</li>
      <li>Its cool and refreshing and no burn.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not at all overpowering, it just has a nice, clean, fresh scent that stays throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>But after about 15 minutes, it begins to drydown and settle down into a wonderful, manly, semi-refined smell that is highlighted by vanilla and the smell of babershop shaving cream.</li>
      <li>Both do a great job of making my face feel soft and clean all day</li>
      <li>Both do a great job of making my face feel soft and clean all day</li>
      <li>I find that a trace of the scent lingers into the evening (which is fine with me as I don&#x27;t wear cologne).</li>
      <li>I prefer Captain&#x27;s Choice aftershaves or Fine aftershaves.</li>
      <li>This fine barber shop after shave has been used since Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday, soldiers in the Civil War throughout history up to the Titanic to the Queen Mary to today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Of course you have, or you wouldn&#x27;t be looking to purchase a fine product like this.  </li>
      <li>product works fine as an aftershave if you like alcohol.  </li>
      <li>Rest of the stars go for the fragrance and the cool refreshing feeling it gives after a baby smooth shave.</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic scent, I&#x27;ve heard some say it&#x27;s too strong and to cut it with witch hazel.</li>
      <li>So for $6 for around 6 oz you have a great, classic, distinctive scent, and a good quality aftershave that can double as your cologne.</li>
      <li>It gives you a unique classic smell that isn&#x27;t over powering and doesn&#x27;t linger like some after shaves do, you still smell good</li>
      <li>I think these are pretty good adjectives, and quite a bit more effectively descriptive than the analogy which I was trying to form, which involved Errol Flynn&#x27;s armpits, the tropics, and French royalty.&lt;br</li>
      <li>At first was not to impressed,  I mean smells good, but how to impress the ladies smelling like my dad?</li>
      <li>The scent is amazing and it truly reminds me of an old barber shop, as many have said.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap; it smells like cheap; and it smells STRONGLY of cheap.  </li>
      <li>The barber always ended his shave with a huge dose of Pinaud Clubman from the industrial size bottle on the counter.</li>
      <li>Very powdery smell not over powering thats kind of addicting.</li>
      <li>Fortunately i like it.</li>
      <li>It also makes me skin feel smooth and powdery.</li>
      <li>and I enjoy the retro scent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Ok, overall a great aftershave.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a light scent that stays with you for a while.  </li>
      <li>Another fabulous product from Clubman Pinaud.</li>
      <li>A citrusy, musky, almost cheap smelling juice.</li>
      <li>That may sound initially cheap, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
      <li>and you will have a fantastic experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Cheap, tames razor burn, fades to a powdery fragrances.</li>
      <li>Overall this is a great after shave works well on skin and helping with after burn and cuts.</li>
      <li>, it is cheap insofar as cost</li>
      <li>Kicks like cheap whiskey though.</li>
      <li>( it won&#x27;t suffocate people in an elevator like some designer colognes do) but does leave a gentle scent that is noticed...and always liked.</li>
      <li>What I do know is that I enjoy it, and</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like any cheap after shave like lectric or aqua velvet...</li>
      <li>cheap</li>
      <li>, it is a terrific astringent leaving my face feeling  great after a close shave.</li>
      <li>Inexpensive but does not smell cheap.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried during my, somewhat, advanced age.</li>
      <li>He liked it so much and wanted to get one.</li>
      <li>Then light up a cigar...</li>
      <li>The product coming in a plastic bottle makes it feel cheap too.</li>
      <li>But one day after work she hugged me and smelled the aftershave and said aloud how much she liked it.  </li>
      <li>great fragrance, this will be my second bottle, I use this as aftershave and to freshen up in the morning</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and will definitely continue to use it after shaving.</li>
      <li>It smells fantastic, even to my girlfriend, and it helps my hair grow in faster and fuller.</li>
      <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
      <li>And the smell is great, brings back memories of watching my grandpa shave.</li>
      <li>This is fantastic.</li>
      <li>Leaves your face feeling smooth and soothed.  </li>
      <li>It leaves you smelling great and feeling refreshed, especially after using a DE razor!</li>
      <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll really enjoy using this because of the &amp;#34;just came from the barbershop&amp;#34</li>
      <li>Pinaud smells great and is a throw back to an era when daper was standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Smells fantastic just like going to the barber vetting a shave and a haircut.</li>
      <li>Fantastic smell.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Cannot believe such a great scent exists at this price.&lt;br</li>
      <li>worries if you don&#x27;t have to shave, a light splash and people will think you did.</li>
      <li>The alcohol is a bit harsh on my face, but to use every once in a while is perfect for me.</li>
      <li>I like the smell, and it makes you comfortable after shaving.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still the same if you have ever experienced it.</li>
      <li>Smells and feels fantastic.</li>
      <li>There are tons of aftershaves available.</li>
      <li>This, along with the Proraso (100mil green bottle) after shave lotion are two that seem to be universally wonderful and proved</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a reason why its so cheap.  </li>
      <li>But its cheap and practically a rite of passage for every man.</li>
      <li>Great scent as well which seems to carry over to the following day.</li>
      <li>It will bring back a lot of great barbershop memories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>If you like Brut or dont know what Brut smells like, you might enjoy this product.  </li>
      <li>So when I needed to add something to my order for free shipping, I bit the bullet.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s fantastic for the price.</li>
      <li>Manly shaving smell, smooth and soothing.</li>
      <li>great aftershave at a ridiculously low price</li>
      <li>Good old style after shave.</li>
      <li>Smells like the good old fashioned type manly smell  from the corner barbershop.  </li>
      <li>Men&#x27;s health did a puff piece on the good old days and the barber shops of my youth.  </li>
      <li>Reminds me of the good old days.</li>
      <li>Best comparison would be to talcum powder smell, like you left straight from the barber shop.</li>
      <li>Does a good job, even on my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Fades away quickly enough to not offend anyone without the good taste to love it.</li>
      <li>The Scent is really good and &#x27;CLASSY&#x27;</li>
      <li>I am 31 and was worried about smelling like an old man, but tonight I went out with some friends and one of my friends who is a girl complimented me on how good I smell</li>
      <li>If you loved the smell of aftershave in an old time barber shop; this is it.</li>
      <li>I received this product on time, and I started using them already, so far so good.</li>
      <li>It dries to a very \\&quot;powdery\\&quot; scent, which is OK but not my favorite thing.  </li>
      <li>A great, clean, lasting scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pleasant, but not overly strong, and in the proper context I do recommend it.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is strong when you put it on but quickly fades (i&#x27;ve found others can smell it within around 30 minutes of putting it on).</li>
      <li>It no longer has that super strong alcohol smell.</li>
      <li>Had to give this one 4 stars though because I like the classic vanilla much more than the original.!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve smelt it and it smells very fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>THIS AFTERSHAVE IS GREAT, LASTS A LONG TIME, EVEN IF I START TO SWEAT MY FACE</li>
      <li>Success!</li>
      <li>so i went with something original</li>
      <li>Well worth it!</li>
      <li>I can recall this familiar smell in barber shops when i was a kid.</li>
      <li>I would say that this is a sure shot with the ladies, otherwise we wouldn&#x27;t be here today ;)</li>
      <li>With that strategy, and by shaving in the shower with lots of hot water, I can get a shave that is even better than a barbershop straight-razor shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not much more to say that hasn&#x27;t already been said about this awesome aftershave.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure that this also clogs up nicks and dings I tend to make when I cut myself shaving.</li>
      <li>and they laugh !</li>
      <li>This is my every day scent, unique, manly, it smells like nothing else.</li>
      <li>That familiar smell of the barber&#x27;s powder?</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure at first about this stuff.  </li>
      <li>It was a very pleasing smell, though do watch out because it is strong!</li>
      <li>Very good clean smell, gotten numerous comments on how good it smells from people both the ladies and other men wondering where to get it.</li>
      <li>A clean feel on the face and a confidence in your step.</li>
      <li>It is a clean scent with no musk or flowers or citrus.</li>
      <li>It wakes me up and keeps me feeling clean.</li>
      <li>Its mellow, clean, and wears off well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a clean manly smell.</li>
      <li>If you like barber shops and a clean smell you will like this.</li>
      <li>&amp; he just smells clean and manly.  </li>
      <li>Clean.</li>
      <li>This mix has been the same and perfect since I was a brat in the 60s - 70s.&lt;br /&gt;Loved it as young shaver, still do at 50 years of age this year.&lt;br</li>
      <li>squirt a bit of clubman on my electric razor head once in awhile to clean it off.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a clean, &amp;#34;just&amp;#34</li>
      <li>Smells intrigingly different and pleasant.</li>
      <li>I shave my head and neck with a straight razor and a good splashing of this will leave you ready for the day.  </li>
      <li>Nice smell, very masculine.</li>
      <li>Great scent, seals up minor cuts quickly.</li>
      <li>not too strong, just right.</li>
      <li>Has a nice light fragrance, dies away quickly and won&#x27;t complete if you plan to wear cologne afterward.</li>
      <li>I switch off between this and the special reserve.</li>
      <li>I Use/Prefer Clubman Special Reserve</li>
      <li>/&gt;ladies, do yourself a favor and buy this for that special man.</li>
      <li>The smell is OK and it is very strong and it lasts several hours.  </li>
      <li>Smells ok, just cheap and sweet, but I gave it to my little brother and he was pretty happy.</li>
      <li>Great smell, works as expected to ease irritation and cool the skin.  </li>
      <li>It also does a pretty good job as far as stopping razor burn and cleaning out any cuts.</li>
      <li>Instead i would like to smell like a true man, like i remember my grandfather smelling.</li>
      <li>A full whiff of this will take your breath away.</li>
      <li>I did like the smell, and the cool bottle.</li>
      <li>It has a nice masculine scent</li>
      <li>Picked this stuff up at Walgreen&#x27;s since I heard such good things.</li>
      <li>I love shaving now because I splash this stuff on my face and ready to face the day.</li>
      <li>I really did hope to like the stuff because of the price and history…but even that couldn&#x27;t persuade me to use it one more time.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d also like to point ouy in my honest opinion this item is only receiving reviews based on nostalgia reasons and not because it&#x27;s an actual great product.</li>
      <li>Ditch the sweet, feminine colognes, lotions, and aftershave gels.  </li>
      <li>More specifically, I can smell citrus oil (not so much lemon blossom or orange oil as citronella), and J&amp;J baby powder, plus there&#x27;s also a &amp;#34;bass</li>
      <li>This stuff is a true bargain</li>
      <li>It is unmistakably masculine and has a distinctive scent of its own.</li>
      <li>This is not the &#x27;modern&#x27; scent which many times cannot be distinguished as either men&#x27;s cologne or women&#x27;s perfume.</li>
      <li>Not only does the product do what its supposed to do it also comes at a fair price.</li>
      <li>Works as advertised, smells good and instantly takes away any stinging after shaving the head!!!</li>
      <li>Good size, will definitely last a while</li>
      <li>/&gt;Gives pinch for a second then feels good.</li>
      <li>Overall, this is a really good product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to smell like a man and not a twelve year old boy.  </li>
      <li>The scent is enjoyable, but doesn&#x27;t linger too much after applied</li>
      <li>It also is very soothing and refreshing after a shave.</li>
      <li>Just as my title states, this is a true manly scent.</li>
      <li>This is how my grandfather used to smell and this aftershave brought back some good memories of my childhood.</li>
      <li>A bit too sweet.</li>
      <li>It has a nice old scent but</li>
      <li>It does a marginal job of relieving razor burn, which is its basic function, but nothing else about it is any good.</li>
      <li>preference is Pinaud Clubman because I like a cool feeling on my face after a shave.</li>
      <li>It does burn but it&#x27;s not too much -- it does make it feel more &amp;#34;machos&amp;#34; in a way...</li>
      <li>Although I don&#x27;t have anything against Old Spice (it kind of reminds me of my dad)</li>
      <li>that is cool again now a days.</li>
      <li>This product has shown me what true men smell like.</li>
      <li>I can see how they recently celebrated 200 years of business.</li>
      <li>I was really surprised how much I liked it.  </li>
      <li>Too sweet and flowery for me.</li>
      <li>They are all true though.  </li>
      <li>Not bad.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a bad aftershave, it does what it is meant to.&lt;br /&gt;THIS WILL WAKE YOU UP WITH THE BURNING ALCOHOL FEEL OF A THOUSAND DEMONS.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>IMO that&#x27;s not a bad thing.</li>
      <li>For that price is not bad at all .Is</li>
      <li>I got it because the reviews said it was not only cheap but also smells really good, which is true in both cases, my friends always tell me that I smell really good all day long when I use it!</li>
      <li>I love both the original Clubman Pinaud and Classic Vanilla scent.</li>
      <li>My favorite alcohol based splash on with a strong masculine scent.  </li>
      <li>Clubman has a nice mild scent-like Canoe, and my daughters frequently mention that they like the fragrance when I give them a hug.  </li>
      <li>A great, nostalgic scent and a pleasant sting as it tightens up your skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a clear, strong \\&quot;cologney\\&quot; scent that lingers with you (or anyone who gets within an inch of your face) for most of the day - just as it should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does have a very strong barber shop smell which I like but not everyday!</li>
      <li>I mean if you want to be the best smelling man in town</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s classic many, though not harsh, smell is quite nice.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pretty strong.</li>
      <li>Strong at first but mellows out after a bit.</li>
      <li>It harkens back to the era of real barber shops, not &amp;#34;styling salons.&amp;#34; It is a classic, manly, wonderful scent.</li>
      <li>Strong at first.</li>
      <li>Works well as an after shave and has a pretty strong scent for an aftershave.  </li>
      <li>The vanilla scent is also very nice... does not really smell of vanilla at all.</li>
      <li>/&gt;it is a classic aftershave that is cool and refreshing would recommend</li>
      <li>After the first splash on my mug, my eyes burned a little bit and the scent hit me like a truck, a very pleasant, manly truck.</li>
      <li>On me personally, its excellent (my skin is pretty sensitive but also a bit oily</li>
      <li>others all have alcohol and give you that familiar cooling, fresh, astringent sensation.</li>
      <li>Other than that, this product is great and I will purchase this again.</li>
      <li>Once the slight sting subsides, it leaves my skin feeling very good (better than a lot of inexpensive aftershaves like Brut or Aqua Velva, specifically this leaves my skin soft and moist without feeling sticky), so I&#x27;m a fan in that regard.</li>
      <li>Fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fresh and clean, and doesn&#x27;t cost $40 and up.</li>
      <li>It is fresh, clean, sort of powdery smell.  </li>
      <li>the fresh, clean, powdery scent.  </li>
      <li>it has a clean and fresh smell.</li>
      <li>I myself love classic barber shop scents.</li>
      <li>I appreciate the smaller opening at the top so it does not dispense more than needed.</li>
      <li>Classic scent that I personally love (age 24).</li>
      <li>and I think it is mild.</li>
      <li>You know that it&#x27;s doing what it&#x27;s supposed to, and any razor burn you had will quickly be gone.</li>
      <li>but as the day wears on and actually, when I get a bit sweaty, believe it or not, it smells even more sexy.</li>
      <li>And then there&#x27;s that famous scent, which brings me back to my childhood trips to the barbershop but never smells &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;- just refreshing.</li>
      <li>if not you may want to try Lucky Tiger brand.</li>
      <li>went out that night to celebrate, and the Most Interesting Man in the world was in the corner table of the local bar.  </li>
      <li>Confident, clear and comfortable.  </li>
      <li>Just A Quick Note:  I</li>
      <li>This is classic slash on shave lotion - I love the aroma.</li>
      <li>The purpose of an aftershave seems two-fold, one as a mild astringent and two for the aroma.</li>
      <li>B0017WNSBS Lucky Tiger</li>
      <li>I personally love the classic Clubman fragrance.</li>
      <li>Those of us who enjoyed a cool buzz cut or a flat top will appreciate this after shave lotion.  </li>
      <li>But I stuck with it and that scent-memory has now been replaced with my own new (happily married with kids) scent-memory.  </li>
      <li>After Shave is pleasant in smell, but I must watch how much I use - can be overbearing if you are not careful.  </li>
      <li>This magical liquid, used right after the shave, would instantly relief the burning sensation (or prevent it from even taking place), and honestly it&#x27;s doing exactly what I bought it for.</li>
      <li>This stuff comes in a plastic bottle (darn, looked more epic online), but is the original Clubman scent....</li>
      <li>so I grabbed the first thing I saw on the shelf because it was cheap and there was lots of it in the bottle.</li>
      <li>It has such a classic scent and it feel great on my face.  </li>
      <li>A classic men&#x27;s scent, splash some on when you want to feel like you just got out from your barber&#x27;s shop and want to tackle the world-very old school in a good way.</li>
      <li>My skin is rather sensitive and, in spite of the &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; this has on my freshly shaven face, it soothes my sensitive skin very nicely.</li>
      <li>Thus began my new love affair.</li>
      <li>Been using this product for more than 50 years tried all the new ones.</li>
      <li>I still love my stetson, brut, skin bracer and aqua velva but wanted to try something new.  </li>
      <li>The bottle will last you a pretty good while.</li>
      <li>Ever since I was a kid my barber would dust behind my ears and neck after my cut with a sweet smelling talc that was absolutely delicious.  </li>
      <li>My wife loves the scent, I love the cool old school bottle.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve even had young guys ask what I&#x27;m wearing because that liked it and were interested in purchasing it for themselves.</li>
      <li>Very Old school and confident smell.</li>
      <li>Even though I haven&#x27;t thought about it in so many years, it&#x27;s still vivid in my memory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this stuff and it reminds of getting haircuts when I was a young teenager, all barbers in Brooklyn NY kept this stuff on hand at all times!</li>
      <li>but it has a very unique smell and the bottle seemed kind of small and cheap.  </li>
      <li>I thought it smelled manly, clean and helped the sting and bleeding after shaving pretty well...</li>
      <li>Another great feature, initially it might be a bit strong but very shortly after using, it fades.</li>
      <li>Their Bay Rum is great and there are still lots of other scents in their lineup I&#x27;d be willing to sample.</li>
      <li>When you line up someone or Razor them up just finish the of with some after shave and it&#x27;ll give the a little sting with a great smell</li>
      <li>much can be overwhelming, so be smart about it, but it is a timeless</li>
      <li>I personally don&#x27;t find the smell overpowering like some have mentioned, but rather the right balance between being able to give off a nice smell that isn&#x27;t too strong, and at the same time doesn&#x27;t vanish as the day goes by.  </li>
      <li>I enjoy the smell so much that I&#x27;m now shaving every 2-3 days.</li>
      <li>I gave it 3 stars for fast shipping and smooth transaction.</li>
      <li>When it arrived I immediately had to try it, which was fun since it was about</li>
      <li>and overall I really liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great old time barbershop smell, reminds me of my dad&#x27;s WW2 generation who went on to work office jobs after the war but still smelled manly, not effeminate like subsequent generations.</li>
      <li>It just has a fresh sort of feel.  </li>
      <li>I love this old school aftershave...</li>
      <li>It is a fresh powdery scent.</li>
      <li>I say this because there are far better products out there for post shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Worth every cent</li>
      <li>But take it for what its worth.</li>
      <li>Pick up your ax, eat your steak rare, and smell like a man.</li>
      <li>and I also love the fact that its readily available in any drug store or supermarket, which made it my personal go-to for a while.</li>
      <li>I never would have guessed it was even worth mentioning.</li>
      <li>I never would have guessed it was even worth mentioning.</li>
      <li>It smells nice and it&#x27;s inexpensive, but I definitely can&#x27;t use it.</li>
      <li>It does smell that fresh.</li>
      <li>If you are getting into old school shaving you can confidently buy a bottle of this and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
      <li>If you want something that reminds you of how men smelled fresh from a barbershop-</li>
      <li>definitely like it, but the real judge of whether this is any good is the lady in your life.  </li>
      <li>Most men know the sandalwood-like smell from the Pinaud talc they still use in old fashioned barber shops.</li>
      <li>So much so I decided to give more of their products a sample since they are very affordable.</li>
      <li>By the time the package was opened all of the after shave lotion had been evaporated or absorbed into the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Go get a bottle guys you will love the old barber shop smell.</li>
      <li>And then a handsome young snowboarder (dichotomy #1) asked to share our chair, and as luck would have it, it was he who smelled so divine (dichotomy #2)</li>
      <li>Yours will too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean and fresh..</li>
      <li>The minute I put it on a get an exciting tingle all over my body</li>
      <li>This is a nice, classically manly-smelling aftershave.  </li>
      <li>It smells very similar to, and nicely complements, the Clubman Pinaud talc.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fun, it will make you smell like Grandpa.</li>
      <li>My Father and Myself love this old fashioned lotion.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used this, I gave it to my boyfriend as a gift, he said he likes it, and I just love them smell so classy</li>
      <li>Ofcourse, smell is objective, but most people I know enjoy the smell</li>
      <li>It has a fresh crips smell to it.</li>
      <li>This stuff goes on great and leaves my face feeling completely refreshed after my daily DE shave.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>and I had to laugh.</li>
      <li>that fresh haircut and a shave feeling is reborn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It really is old school, my wife and kids love it</li>
      <li>The fragrance is strong but decent.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own or in conjunction with multiple products.</li>
      <li>Just for fun I bought a sample of this from Garry&#x27;s sample shop.  </li>
      <li>I have been looking for different shaving lotions to give some kind of variety.  </li>
      <li>Worth a try for $6.</li>
      <li>I and a lot of college kids discovered Clubman aftershave in the 60s as an economical alternative to Canoe.</li>
      <li>It does not smell fresh at all.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice scent and has a better lasting power than most other aftershave lotions that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you are a gentleman that is worthy of a top hat and cane, if you can hold a monocle in wilst bare knuckle boxing a lion, then this is for you.</li>
      <li>men know that slapping alcohol right on your freshly shaved skin is what you are suppose to do, none of that moisturizing stuff here</li>
      <li>to the actual product being reviewed, though--if your skin isn&#x27;t significantly irritated, or if you&#x27;re really going to use aftershave as a cologne, not applying it right after shaving, this is a nice option.  </li>
      <li>Love this product, smells fresh and clean, my husband had actually bought it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a cheap aftershave that smells like original Old Spice to me.</li>
      <li>In the seventies, I tried my first &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; colognes and found that for an extraordinary price, I could wear a fragrance that made me smell somewhere between a man and a woman.  </li>
      <li>My only concern is that it has a strong scent and can be easily over applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>I have been testing out different after shave rubs for a couple for months now, and I have really enjoyed the invigorating feel of the Clubman Pinaud after a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>guess the true test was asking my wife for her opinion and it was a positive one.  </li>
      <li>I was truly excited while shaving this morning, ready to try this on.</li>
      <li>But if you&#x27;ve ever had a haircut in a real barbershop, chance are you are already familiar with Clubman.</li>
      <li>i think it carries the right amount of musk.</li>
      <li>I would never want to wear this right before work since some people may complain.</li>
      <li>Just the right amount of sting after shaving my face and my head.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve earned my right to wear Clubman Pinaud</li>
      <li>its just right .  </li>
      <li>The price is right so give it a go.</li>
      <li>(after it has settled for about 30 minutes; if she smells the CC right after application, she hates it).  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Applying a nickel-sized puddle of this to the face is the right way to start any day, even if you don&#x27;t shave that day.</li>
      <li>The price was right.</li>
      <li>Yes, right after I splash on some Clinique For Men Oil Control Exfoliating Tonic.  </li>
      <li>,thats right and all the girls at work still come up to me and say &amp;</li>
      <li>I tried this based on many positive reviews and found that my wife thinks it is as good an aroma as the more expensive Drakkar.  </li>
      <li>It leaves a very masculine classy scent and the chicks love it!</li>
      <li>But the Geo Trumper Coral skin food is what I will most likely use, long term, because of its light scent and cool refreshing feel.</li>
      <li>It can be pretty powerful when first applied but backs off quickly.</li>
      <li>am pretty sure this is going to attract 50 year old women with daddy issues</li>
      <li>This stuff has a really great old fashioned smell that lasts all day long.  </li>
      <li>However old this magic juice is, the smell is still very pleasing, masculine, and refreshing.</li>
      <li>nothing less  Perfect for daily use.</li>
      <li>This, combined with the &#x27;66 super speed I gave him, brings back many memories for him.</li>
      <li>I like this more than Old Spice and this price is better than my local CVS!</li>
      <li>I realized, however, that I&#x27;d never even TRIED an alcohol-based aftershave, and that, in our modern, free world, a man is able to order things such as this on Amazon, just to see how they work.</li>
      <li>Great spicy, alcoholic scent that feels vintage.</li>
      <li>It gives that nice burn when I use it and the scent doesn&#x27;t linger too long.  </li>
      <li>Momentarily burns your skin before soothing and giving off a nice smell that doesn&#x27;t linger too long.</li>
      <li>And it would be hard to top the clean scent &amp; refreshing feeling of Clubman Pinaud.</li>
      <li>but I will go back to my good old &amp;#34;skin bracer&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>far as the smell goes, I did not find it to be too strong.  </li>
      <li>I never disliked the scent but it took a day or two for me to really get used to it, and really love it.</li>
      <li>So, I discovered that the scent of the Clubman after shave is noticeably different and less pleasant when the bottle has been sitting for a while, so make sure to shake it before each use.  </li>
      <li>Later that night at the grocery store, the cashier gave me my groceries for free, and the manager gave me a lifetime of free groceries of I</li>
      <li>Nothing makes you feel more like a man than carving up your face with an old fashioned straight razor just before applying this virtual fire to your face.  </li>
      <li>I personally LOVE the scent and find it does not dry out my skin.  </li>
      <li>Growing up, and getting my hair cut at the old local barber shop, I always loved the distinctive &amp;#34;old barber shop&amp;#34; smell.</li>
      <li>A bit strong for those with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>After five or six hours it will fade to the sort of fragrance that Pinaud puts in its talc, but before that there&#x27;s a complex medley of soft, smooth, and very pleasant aromas that smell natural and masculine, but in a gentlemanly sort of way--it&#x27;s intended more for going to the opera than going out to the woods to hunt grizzly bears.</li>
      <li>By the time you&#x27;re done getting ready, have out this on, and have gone out for the day; it will have the perfect light, distinct, classic, full-bodied, aroma that sets you apart from every other person that girl has been around that day</li>
      <li>Now the regular scent which we are talking about here is more balanced and better used in those touchy &#x27;Social Situations!&#x27;</li>
      <li>Very much of the less-is-more era.</li>
      <li>I very much like this scent.</li>
      <li>Very reasonably prices, seven dollars for six ounces.</li>
      <li>Price is very reasonable for the size of the bottle and the quality of it.</li>
      <li>it is very reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>Very reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>Classic with a little sting, great end to a shave.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve worn Old Spice Fresh for years, and now I have a new favorite.</li>
      <li>This is a traditional, authentic, barbershop product with a pleasant, masculine scent that stays long after application.</li>
      <li>So if you&#x27;re most concerned about keeping your face smooth and soft over the long run, you might prefer Lucky</li>
      <li>Will buy the larger bottle next time with free shipping for a better deal!</li>
      <li>Good but little pricecee for the size</li>
      <li>Classic, cool, crisp scent.</li>
      <li>The alcohol content is very high, and just by smelling it you can tell how powerful it is.</li>
      <li>As an eighteen year old in high school i smell lots kids wearing Axe&#x27;s latest aerosol \\&quot;cologne\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>Pretty manly stuff here</li>
      <li>It thought it was the moment that I got my first car or after my first time I was with a woman.</li>
      <li>It was the first time I slapped this stuff on my face.</li>
      <li>I have been using this for several yearrs and love it.  </li>
      <li>From my husband - at first he was reluctant to try to an &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; aftershave that came in a plastic bottle....turned out to be his favorite....much nicer scent and easier on sink than Hugo Boss, Pack Rabanne Million etc.</li>
      <li>I first heard about it from the Art of Manliness blog and decided to check it out.</li>
      <li>Tried this for the first time...</li>
      <li>I had not really heard of Clubman until I had to order my father some of their hair gel here on Amazon and tried a container of it and liked it myself.  </li>
      <li>The crowning jewel of a rewarding classical shave.</li>
      <li>I tried it for the first time.</li>
      <li>Lovely earthy tones mixed with a barber shop scent.  </li>
      <li>After Shave Lotion, and some you better grow a pair and start acting like you do, too.</li>
      <li>For the first couple days I knew a</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m gladly going back to my Proraso.  </li>
      <li>This will bring you back to the days when you walked out of the barber shop feeling like you were on top of the world after paying two bits for a shave and a haircut.</li>
      <li>First I&#x27;d like to say this product is NOT a lotion as labeled on bottle and description.</li>
      <li>I am pretty sure they put some sort of inhale-able addictive substance in this product.</li>
      <li>I can gladly give this product a solid five stars!</li>
      <li>Possibly the most manliest of manly aftershave</li>
      <li>Every time I take a whiff it takes me back to the days of five dollar haircuts :)</li>
      <li>but I decided to buy some when I bought my first double-edge razor.</li>
      <li>It was pretty surreal.</li>
      <li>When I wear it, as I do and have regularly, I get many compliments from the female persuasion on its appealing scent.</li>
      <li>In the 1960s, when I first started shaving, I used my Dad&#x27;s after shaves...</li>
      <li>you are not for the most recent then you will like this</li>
      <li>I love this Clubman Pinuad scent takes me back to the days when the barber would sit me up into the booster seat in his chair.</li>
      <li>It is not expensive item</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>Also, it is a perfectly logical companion to the Arko shave soap in my kit.</li>
      <li>Many people like and dislike this product for the same reason.</li>
      <li>totally reminds me of my barber shop and gives that manly scent I love about going to a &amp;#34;barber shop&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite parts of going to the barber shop is when, at the end, the barber sprinkles Clubman talcum powder on the back of my neck.</li>
      <li>but when I finally finish it I will order more.</li>
      <li>I wish there was a way to sample the scents before buying, but Clubman is more likely to be sold in a pharmacy than a fancy department store where there is a girl at the perfume counter waiting to let you sample everything under the sun.</li>
      <li>First off, if you are a member of the metro-sexual, Axe spraying, Justin Bieber listening boys club move along.</li>
      <li>You need a current man card to appreciate the simplicity of it, yet need to be able to distinguish between the complexity of what it means to use a man&#x27;s man&#x27;s product and the responsibility in doing so.</li>
      <li>Sure, I don&#x27;t smell like a male model, but I don&#x27;t want to smell like desperation.</li>
      <li>Just this morning I used Clubman for the first time ever.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my dad for father&#x27;s day and he really likes it!</li>
      <li>It does exactly what you expect in an aftershave.</li>
      <li>they&#x27;re typically interested in smelling you.</li>
      <li>It smells almost exactly like a barber shop.&lt;br</li>
      <li>\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at my husband, sitting safely unmolested on my left.</li>
      <li>I am the first one chosen.</li>
      <li>Thanks Clubman!</li>
      <li>My favorite is George F. Trumper brand \\&quot;skin food\\&quot; (especially this one:</li>
      <li>Yeah this is going to smell exactly as you imagine it will.</li>
      <li>You may even wear it out, assuming you&#x27;re either a married man or out with your pals on a bowling night.</li>
      <li>They were kinda hot though.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be getting more when my current bottle runs out.</li>
      <li>I never fail to get compliments when I wear Clubman.</li>
      <li>I was able to find it at my local cvs.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this.</li>
      <li>Overall, they are all excellent, however, they are naturally different in various ways, so one&#x27;s taste may cause a preference for one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>First time I used it, she came home afterwork and just said &amp;#34;WOW</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend!!</li>
      <li>The bottle stipulates that it is the same formula from a more civilized time, however the scent doesn&#x27;t remind me of my grandfather as old spice does.  </li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s pretty</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>THANKS CLUBMAN!</li>
      <li>4 stars, not 5 - I only 5 for truly outstanding products.  </li>
      <li>For wet shavers, this pairs beautifully with the talcum powder under the same label.</li>
      <li>As many have written, this is a very traditional barber shop like scent.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different after shaves.</li>
      <li>Great, long lasting smell.</li>
      <li>Wakes you up in the morning, and leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>with that said, I remember when I first used it.  </li>
      <li>this stuff smells great and smell is long lasting.</li>
      <li>Though I would expect it be in a better packaging which will only add to its value.</li>
      <li>Years later, I discovered that the scent that triggered so many fond memories was this after shave.</li>
      <li>Since I started using Clubman, I have received many compliments, especially from the ladies.</li>
      <li>but it also has this crisp manly scent to it.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t judge a book bye its cover its not expensive</li>
      <li>Good value for everyday wear.</li>
      <li>Nice classic smell, a bit strong for me but wiping with my damp towel brings it down to a reasonable level, for me anyway.</li>
      <li>High quality product worthy of 5 stars</li>
      <li>/&gt;And if you live in a warm climate, try their talk on a traditional horsehair neck duster in the summer.</li>
      <li>This is alcohol based, so it&#x27;s not super pleasant on nics and cuts, but it works great in conjunction with some cold water to close up pores, kill bacteria, and keep the face feeling fresh and clean all day.</li>
      <li>I (as well and my gf) prefer Brut because it&#x27;s a little more manly, though both are cheap.</li>
      <li>Now, it definitely is old school, it will make you think of what the original barber shops would use.  </li>
      <li>Clubman Pinaud is the real deal and comes complete with memories of smoke filled upstairs barbershop, wrinkled leather chairs and barber honing a keen edge on his leather strop.  </li>
      <li>came across this after shave after comparing prices with the art of shaving products which In fact are great products but ridiculously over priced.</li>
      <li>This stuff is powerful, inexpensive, and packs a classic barbershop scent.</li>
      <li>Classic, well groomed, fresh from the barbershop scent.  </li>
      <li>I use an electric razor and while it rarely nicks or cuts, the slight tingle and smell bring back some great memories.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll still use it from time to time but be aware that this is a very classic musky smelling aftershave.</li>
      <li>If you like the masculine scent of an old time barber shop then you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
      <li>Pair it with Tailor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood shaving soap and go ahead and find a nice big stick to fight off all those ladies with.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a good masculine scent that also provided relief from razor nicks/burn as well as closed your pores.</li>
      <li>Goes on strong, but settles into a nice, subtle scent after a hour or so.</li>
      <li>The light, masculine scent really did remind me of a barbershop.</li>
      <li>so Soft is also kind of similar.</li>
      <li>B001711FMI Clubman Jeris Osage Rub, 14 Fluid Ounce]], which probably produces the most intense cooling sensation you can get without placing your face into ice</li>
      <li>That can be a good thing if you need to be low key, but no one will smell it unless they, ummmm, lick you.</li>
      <li>But it does smell like old rusted hotel on top of mountain where old people come for vacations with cane holding in their hand to walk.</li>
      <li>My skin is sensitive and this worked ok but didn&#x27;t wow me.</li>
      <li>I guess granpa was pretty smart after all.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Guys with acne, I strongly suggest this to you, the scennt is lasting and very fresh, a typial vanilla spice old barber stuff</li>
      <li>It shipped fast in early in the product smells great even if you don&#x27;t shave every day just a little splash in the morning before to work</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve received nothing but positive feedback since I started using it.</li>
      <li>It would behoove you to believe the rest of the reviews, the positive ones that is.</li>
      <li>It has a positive effect on my skin after shaving.  </li>
      <li>After reading all of the positive reviews I needed to give Clubman Pinaud aftershave a try.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry the skin, and feels very smooth after.</li>
      <li>A classic, clean, masculine scent, this aftershave leaves my face feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
      <li>Actually look forward to using this stuff after a shave, clean and crisp!</li>
      <li>It took about 24 hours for me to really figure out why my sense memory was nagging at me ever since I first put this on.  </li>
      <li>This is dead cheap and you&#x27;d spend four times as much to find better in a compounded cologne.</li>
      <li>It can pretty much be used as a deodorant/cologne as well.</li>
      <li>Unlike everyone else on here, my first reaction wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;I feel like a real man\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Tried a few and very satisfied.</li>
      <li>Maybe it will be good for every once and a while, but still not sure yet.</li>
      <li>The good news is that a bottle will usually run you between 3 and 5 bucks so</li>
      <li>That being said, once the 15 second pain-cycle has ended, your face will feel clean and fresh.  </li>
      <li>There are a lot of humorous reviews of this aftershave, but this one is going to be more serious.</li>
      <li>The great thing about Clubman it is incredibly subtle, but very longlasting.</li>
      <li>Call me old school, but I enjoy the classic scent.</li>
      <li>this is really barbershop perfume and it leaves the skin clean and soft.</li>
      <li>last a long time, reminds me of barbershop, others think the smell is too strong, but i love it.</li>
      <li>I have used so many high priced after shave lotions and this one simply beats all off them on price and quality front.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It give a person a sense of a fresh new haircut after having one.</li>
      <li>Very classic smell.</li>
      <li>and it is a very classic barbershop scent</li>
      <li>This lotion always leaves me feeling super soft.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very classic scent.</li>
      <li>This stuff has that same musky, strong, grandpa-in-the-barbershop smell.</li>
      <li>The smell is ok, very old-school, but it lingers for an exceptionally long period of time.</li>
      <li>A tip for the single guy&#x27;s, women do love this.</li>
      <li>It certainly isn&#x27;t overpowering.  </li>
      <li>Have you ever wondered what it would feel like to rinse your face with pure awesomeness?</li>
      <li>THIS IS THE SENT OF PURE MAN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>if you are, this&#x27;ll certainly place you in the column of keeper.</li>
      <li>Classic scent in a soothing aftershave for a very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>It took me by surprise, I almost forced my wife to clean all the dishes and clean the house!!</li>
      <li>One of my new favorites!!</li>
      <li>highly recommend this product, and I can honestly say it will last up a super long time</li>
      <li>This may be labeled after shave, but with a generous splash or two on the neck and shoulders, etc., it makes a fine cologne that will last all day.</li>
      <li>If this is too much for you to grasp or appreciate don&#x27;t waste your time, Axe products are always looking for more weenies!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not overly &#x27;hot&#x27; from the alcohol, and does a decent job of soothing after a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nothing beats this classic &amp; affordable scent!</li>
      <li>Very highly.</li>
      <li>As I recall it was a little sticky, but it smelled nice.  </li>
      <li>After the first 10 seconds of burn wears off, youre left feeling refreshed and clean.</li>
      <li>However, the smell is so strong that it&#x27;s just flat out overpowering, gaudy, and too flowery in my opinion.</li>
      <li>Pinaud&#x27;s Special Reserve, which IMO smells even better but doesn&#x27;t last quite as long.</li>
      <li>This stuff is intensely scented, so much so that my girlfriend really,</li>
      <li>My Girlfriend complained that I smelled too \\&quot;sanitized\\&quot; after I shaved because I used a touch of rubbing alcohol as my aftershave - don&#x27;t judge, it&#x27;s cheap and does the job well... :)  </li>
      <li>Very soothing scent and feel.</li>
      <li>Smells like something a real man should smell like.</li>
      <li>and I tell them straight up -</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>A real woman is attracted to the smell of a real man.</li>
      <li>so I added it to the cart not expecting much.  </li>
      <li>You can really feel the burn.</li>
      <li>Very old-school scent.</li>
      <li>But they sell something for when you absolutely must cut the heck out of your neck, or anyone elses.     </li>
      <li>I began using this aftershave when I began shaving with a straight razor.  </li>
      <li>THE WHOLE DAY</li>
      <li>There is too much alcohol in it.</li>
      <li>If you use too much</li>
      <li>I started taking it in a separate ziplock but that cause too much liquid to be lost, so I&#x27;m not taking it on my trips</li>
      <li>I was worried the smell would be over powering but after repeatedly asking my wife it if was too much</li>
      <li>like it so much I am going to get some for my husband as well.  </li>
      <li>This and Bay Rum are the REAL DEAL.</li>
      <li>I really like it.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Clubman.....</li>
      <li>I spent $7.07 including tax, defiantly they make more than $6:00 profit.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really compare it with anything else.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the memories...</li>
      <li>He says, its like real man.</li>
      <li>In fact I really don&#x27;t see how anyone in their 20&#x27;s, or 30&#x27;s or even their 40&#x27;s should even be allowed to purchase this product.</li>
      <li>I really like the fragrance and</li>
      <li>After reading all of the reviews about how this is a real man scent, I was intrigued.</li>
      <li>Folks will know that you are a real man who doesn&#x27;t go for that unisex girlie smelling cologne when they get a whiff of this.</li>
      <li>Give you a real Kevin McCallister moment.</li>
      <li>is a creamy after shave which I really like.</li>
      <li>its likely that the formula really is around 200 years old, which means it was also probably popular with old guys when my grandfather&#x27;s grandfather was just a kid.</li>
      <li>really well after I shave.</li>
      <li>I shave with a straight razor.  </li>
      <li>but I grew to really liking it.</li>
      <li>My wife really likes as does my daughter.</li>
      <li>Learned to avoid the gf after using in the morning so not as much of a problem.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I would much rather be a member of this elite club of gentlemen than to conform with the collective of boys, boy bands, and bieber freaks of the world.</li>
      <li>The reviews here really compelled us to purchase here and the quality of the product seems good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Had to take off 1 star because the sticker on the bottle is made of that tin foil sticker crap.. lol don&#x27;t care for it but other than that its pretty good stuff!</li>
      <li>This aftershave really irritated my skin.</li>
      <li>This product really works.</li>
      <li>The consistency (viscosity) very liquidy</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>and i decided to go for Culbman Pinaud after seeing rave reviews and reasonable price in Amazon</li>
      <li>I really wish it came in a glass bottle.</li>
      <li>wife really loves it too......</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s not made from bits of real panther which is always a bonus.</li>
      <li>I absolutely recommend Clubmans Pinaud</li>
      <li>After Shave Lotion for any guy who is ready to toss the girly-man aftershave and use something that smells like a guys aftershave should.</li>
      <li>Very musk like and spicy.</li>
      <li>The smell was very flowery with a bit of a baby powder smell.</li>
      <li>the fragrance is notoverwhelming, yet it gives a fresh, masculine, fragrance that lasts.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the stuff a real barber uses on you after a shave or hair cut in a barber shop that men go to.</li>
      <li>VERY WELL.</li>
      <li>Bought this after receiving a sample from a straight razor supplier.</li>
      <li>It says it&#x27;s &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s really a splash.</li>
      <li>The product works very well.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking for an aftershave or just to rub some on when you&#x27;re ready to go out.</li>
      <li>shave soap- thanks</li>
      <li>This is the ultamate in manliness, this stuff has so much respect</li>
      <li>It is really very pleasurable!$5 is a grat price for this.</li>
      <li>Really?</li>
      <li>Going to straight to the trash</li>
      <li>I really like this aftershave.</li>
      <li>It also works very well.</li>
      <li>so much sometimes I just splash a bit on my face even when I dont shave.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27; t like the scent too much.</li>
      <li>My wife really likes the smell as well.</li>
      <li>Shave with a safety or straight razor.</li>
      <li>I got a haircut in the booster seat and he got a haircut and straight razor shave.</li>
      <li>My wife really likes it too.</li>
      <li>Today I decided to grow up and get a real man&#x27;s haircut in lieu of one that requires gel.  </li>
      <li>then this is no worse then what you&#x27;ve been using.</li>
      <li>Sounds nuts, but we both really like the way it smells.</li>
      <li>Really Like This Clubman Aftershave.  </li>
      <li>Ogallala Bay rum which I really like,</li>
      <li>Smell was pungent that mild.&lt;br /&gt;Didnt use it much.</li>
      <li>There really isn&#x27;t much else to say, and I don&#x27;t want to take away from Dr. StrangeBrew&#x27;s thunder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is the genuine smell I remember from the barbershops as a kid back in the 50s when I went with my dad.</li>
      <li>It is alcohol-based, so it really wakes you up after shaving.  </li>
      <li>Ready for my 5 star review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>stuff is the real deal.</li>
      <li>which is all that really matters in an aftershave, so</li>
      <li>If you didn&#x27;t have such a smooth shave, you will feel a sting.</li>
      <li>I cannot believe such a cheap after-shave has worked out so well for me.</li>
      <li>But be ready -</li>
      <li>i shave with a straight edge, not a safety razor.</li>
      <li>Even my WIFE really likes it</li>
      <li>and she&#x27;s really picky about what she likes me</li>
      <li>really strong.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>and what I really like about</li>
      <li>Barber Shop and Smelling like a real man.</li>
      <li>Who wants to smell like they just strolled through a forest or went skinny dipping in the ocean?  </li>
      <li>Not for date night but very inexpensive.</li>
      <li>Because it really doesn&#x27;t matter.  </li>
      <li>Those are both good things, to me at least.. Hehehe.</li>
      <li>Sure it&#x27;s old man after shave but back then men were men!</li>
      <li>The downer to me is the scent lingers all day and it kind of has a powdery tone after a few hours.  </li>
      <li>Smells like a old time barber shop, women like it too !!!</li>
      <li>One six ounce bottle has lasted me for several months, so it is a very economical buy as well.</li>
      <li>It smells good, I like it, but I would prefer it was a little less strong..</li>
      <li>I could smell it the rest of the day, and I even caught a quick whiff of it when I first got in the shower the next morning.  </li>
      <li>It smells much closer to Magno, but since Magno is only slightly familiar here now in the U.S.</li>
      <li>Good stuff, no more bumps and reminds me of when my dad would go to the old school barbers!</li>
      <li>This is a pleasant scent, but not super masculine like Old Spice.</li>
      <li>I do like to mix it up between Virgin Island Bay Rum, this, and other more modern colognes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a classic, fresh, masculine scent.</li>
      <li>I love this classic sent that wakes up and softens your skin after a wet shave.  </li>
      <li>When I first got this product I was surprised at how large the bottle was.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff and look forward to trying other Pinaud products.</li>
      <li>There are two other things that this product is famous for. 1</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure other people don&#x27;t smell cat urine</li>
      <li>has the same original smell as the Original back in the Days.</li>
      <li>It does not last very long and has a very sweet smell that is kind of overwhelming and not pleasant.</li>
      <li>So, I tried it the first time this morning and there was no hurtful stinging on my tender skin, I found that it would be okay for me as the sting was almost missing.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipment and now all the older ladies keep sniffing around .......</li>
      <li>Definitely makes you smell like you just got a clean shave.</li>
      <li>Nice powdery scent, long lasting.</li>
      <li>I usually use Acqa Velva but love this product and the price is right.</li>
      <li>But be aware that you will have an old man scent.  </li>
      <li>#34;clean&amp;#34; without being flowery, sweet, or fruity which is what I&#x27;m personally after.</li>
      <li>Definitely a tried and true scent.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re more of a fan of a more modern scent (unfortunately, my wife is)</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and it never fails to sooth after i shave.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty much completely gone after an hour.  </li>
      <li>will smell like you just stepped out of an old timey barbershop where Clarence gave you a close shave and a hot towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It definitely has an&amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; fragrance, but that&#x27;s not bad.</li>
      <li>I love the fragrance of this particular one, Not sure how much its is effective in killing germs and protecting skin as I have bene using this only since last 3 weeks but its good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It smells better than some of the more expensive colognes I own although it does not last very long.</li>
      <li>It has a rather strong, complex scent that reminds me of an old fashioned barbershop, the kind where the barber used a big straight razor the size of a meat cleaver to shave you.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of classic aftershaves, but clubman has helped me to realize that I don&#x27;t like sweet, powdery, and floral scents.</li>
      <li>Or maybe I had touched a live electrical wire to my face!  </li>
      <li>Few have unique, generally enjoyable fragrances that women sill actually compliment on.</li>
      <li>It smells fresh and clean with slight scent of baby powder.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell, healing and slight burn.</li>
      <li>This after shave has been a classic for generations.</li>
      <li>Classic aftershave at a bargain price</li>
      <li>A classic.</li>
      <li>Will most likely always be an item next to my shaving</li>
      <li>It reminds me of a classic barber shop.</li>
      <li>The fragance is classic and you&#x27;ll feel you are celebrating V-E day, or just smell</li>
      <li>As a classic \\&quot;drugstore\\&quot; type product, it is decent.  </li>
      <li>Just a classic aftershave.  </li>
      <li>The classic.  </li>
      <li>Clubman is one of the classic afterhshaves used by barbers for generations.</li>
      <li>Oh, what a manly classic smell.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still around because its a classic.</li>
      <li>its a classic smell.</li>
      <li>It smells like you just got a shave from a classic, hole in the wall, barber shop, like our fathers, uncles, grandfathers, etc.</li>
      <li>Classic scent.</li>
      <li>The scent is the same and the application of splashing on face and refreshing the skin is also no different.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is a classic smell.</li>
      <li>In addition to the smell, I don&#x27;t find that this product is particularly soothing to the skin.  </li>
      <li>After splashing some Clubman on I feel like my iron jawed grandfather after coming home from World War 2 and killing Nazi&#x27;s and procreating with many French and Italian women.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a smell that is timeless and classic.</li>
      <li>I bought some of the &#x27;classic&#x27; aftershaves to use after I shave, which is at home in the evening when nobody else can smell me</li>
      <li>I swear i had a couple older women linger stares after coming close by.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t smell like a cologne, but at the same time it was more than just the soap they used that morning, highly likely it was this stuff.</li>
      <li>For my main or Daytime after shave</li>
      <li>I agree with the reviews about it having that classic smell to it.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t particularly care for the scent</li>
      <li>Classic scent.</li>
      <li>The classic.  </li>
      <li>so you can tell it&#x27;s a classic.</li>
      <li>I guess some things are just classic</li>
      <li>There is only a mild sting.</li>
      <li>Classic scent.  </li>
      <li>Classic barber shop smell.  </li>
      <li>Clubman Pinaud is a classic aftershave.</li>
      <li>A classic scent for any man</li>
      <li>i would think it&#x27;s a classic one for after shaving</li>
      <li>But if you grew up in a certain era, you got your haircut by a guy named Louie in a barber shop with three or four big stuffed waiting chairs and a table full of old Field and Stream magazines.</li>
      <li>This is a product that will last you for a long time, like many people have said, it is very strong so just a few drops will do it.</li>
      <li>It has a unique smell and it lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>Not sure if i&#x27;m old enough for this smell lol.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Had high hopes for this one.</li>
      <li>This stuff smells to high heaven and burns like hell.</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
      <li>Want to smell like some cheese-eating high school boy?  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>The minute you open the bottle for the first time and smell this stuff, you&#x27;ll feel like you stepped right into the old barber shop that your father took you to as a child.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit strong and flowery when it first goes on, but that doesn&#x27;t last too long.  </li>
      <li>Definitely has a unique, old manish, barber shoppy smell.  </li>
      <li>I would describe the smell as masculine yes, at the same time inviting and accessible.</li>
      <li>So you&#x27;ve got your Merkur safety razor, Taylor of Old Bond Street Lavender shaving cream, &amp; Escali pure badger hair shaving brush.</li>
      <li>So yeah i think i like it a little more now plustons of comps from the girls in my life.</li>
      <li>It sooth the face, but i still use a post shave lotion to rehydrate my skin a little more.  </li>
      <li>I wish it burned a little more,...</li>
      <li>I first sniffed it and it reminded me of the cheap Brut aftershave my mother put in my Christmas stocking as a little kid</li>
      <li>quickly got over that phase and went back to my old Gillette Super Speed razor with double edge blades.  </li>
      <li>As for the smell, it is some potent stuff, but once it airs out a little bit it leaves a very manly smell, one like in the old days.</li>
      <li>It has a strangely familiar yet unique quality to it that is hard to explain</li>
      <li>I bought several different kinds of Pinaud aftershave and cologne, and some Lucky tiger when i stated shaving with my old Gellette razors again, Wanted that old time Barber smell from my youth, and I was not disappointed, Would recommend</li>
      <li>Do not expect any citrus scent, it is straight up masculine.      </li>
      <li>Started using a DE safety razor and bought some Clubman Pinaud to complete the whole retro purchase.  </li>
      <li>When you splash this on, be careful because you will feel yourself transforming into a &amp;#34; take no crap from any woman&amp;#34; type of man.</li>
      <li>Wow, this aftershave is absolutely life changing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really wanted Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood</li>
      <li>I really like the smell, it&#x27;s strangely masculine.</li>
      <li>She said it smells too much like an old man.</li>
      <li>Smell is okay, but dried my face out and didn&#x27;t take care of razor burn.</li>
      <li>After 56 years, I have finally been rewarded for being a man and the wait, as some of you see it, has been well worth it.</li>
      <li>It was cute when Macaulay Culkin made a big deal about it in 1990, but he was TEN YEARS OLD.</li>
      <li>It was cute when Macaulay Culkin made a big deal about it in 1990, but he was TEN YEARS OLD.</li>
      <li>My wife says it makes me smell like an old lady, which I find funny, because I didn&#x27;t know old ladies smelled of manliness.  </li>
      <li>I usually don&#x27;t like perfumes and aftershaves (too many sons, too much Axe), but this was so</li>
      <li>If you are old enough to remember going to a man&#x27;s barber shop -- barber pole, straight razor, brush and talc on the back of your neck, old men swapping stories -- then you&#x27;ll love it, too.</li>
      <li>I will admit it brought back memories of straight razors and hot lather.</li>
      <li>smells like I just left a barbershop with a fresh cut aka Pinaud&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My wife especially - it gives her more of an excuse to \\&quot;get close.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>If you want to smell classy, and like a true gentleman who&#x27;s got his act together, definitely pick up a bottle!</li>
      <li>i have many more expensive after shaves but clubman is old world charm of things</li>
      <li>overall worth trying</li>
      <li>Very good astringent characteristics and a fantastic manly scent that unfortunately doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
      <li>You really have to put it on and wait a minute or two for it to calm down before you judge the quality of this cologne because it&#x27;s overpowering at first.</li>
      <li>I highly suggest this to anyone looking for a new after shave, whether you are a beginner or just feeling daring.</li>
      <li>The second thing is that every time you open the bottle the lights go out and a beam of light shines down upon the bottle and angels begin to sing, which is not a problem for me however it wakes my wife up each morning and she is becoming frustrated, luckily once she smells my beautiful manly musk</li>
      <li>This after shave burns far more than any other I have ever used, but hey, when the label states it&#x27;s highly flammable, one shouldn&#x27;t be surprised.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll find the lotion dries down nicely leaving your face toned and smooth...and smelling like a new haircut in the North Bronx back in 1955.</li>
      <li>Bathe me in this stuff and send me to the nearest senior center.&lt;br /&gt;Minus one half star for Clubman Pinaud making me me love smelling like an old man at a nightclub and</li>
      <li>Most inexpensive fragrances depart as soon as they dry, but this one hangs in there from Pearl Harbor to V-E day and back again.</li>
      <li>The short answer is &amp;#34;barbershop&amp;#34;, as in you&#x27;ll smell like you do right after a haircut.</li>
      <li>Some of the other barbers I work with have been using other high end products which does a better job at soothing freshly shaved skin without the sting.</li>
      <li>Its mainly alcohol (I&#x27;m pretty sure the bottle actually warns the user to keep it away from open flames), which tends to dry one&#x27;s skin.  </li>
      <li>Be aware, you cannot return this due to Amazon&#x27;s policy about hazardous/flammable materials (yes, it&#x27;s that powerful).</li>
      <li>Brings back great memories of that fresh haircut before the big game on Friday nights.</li>
      <li>After having it on a while it calms to a pretty subtle scent which i am enjoying.</li>
      <li>This is a man&#x27;s aftershave, you&#x27;ll be reminded of better days of past, when your pappy took you to the barber shop, and those old barbers that told war stories, cut your hair with real scissors and blade.</li>
      <li>At first smell it really seems like any generic old school aftershave.</li>
      <li>Amazon is offering this Clubman Pinaud on the \\&quot;add-on\\&quot; program for free shipping with other items</li>
      <li>And so what if it does smell like your grandfather, he was probably more man than u little young ones today</li>
      <li>/&gt;I might have to start a new slang, Pinaud now means &amp;#34;Fresh&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am thinking new one to be gift for my friends</li>
      <li>Never buy a new fragrance for a guy.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a classic smell, almost an old man smell.</li>
      <li>Nice subtle smell.</li>
      <li>Classic old school aftershave.</li>
      <li>Old school scent I recall from the older men in my family.</li>
      <li>I am also going to try the Old Spice classic aftershave  </li>
      <li>Some days you just feel that swagger and this 200 year old classic aftershave ties it all together.</li>
      <li>Old timey, but classic.  </li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s Pinaud for me all the way - reminds me of an old classic barber shop.</li>
      <li>Classic scent - reminds me of the old school barber shops.</li>
      <li>I have to point out that this is a odor for mature men, like 25 and older.</li>
      <li>If you have to say that this is scent is classic, it means you smell like an old man.  </li>
      <li>So for those delicate situations where you need a good but moderate</li>
      <li>It really does take care of those inevitable shaving nicks with out too much stinging.</li>
      <li>I only recently found that it is available in this aftershave version.  </li>
      <li>Reminds me of the old classic men&#x27;s cologne, Canoe.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little pungent at first (not to the point of stinging the nostrils or anything) but it dissipates quickly</li>
      <li>Smells classy and classic without making me smell like an old man!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very old fashion scent.</li>
      <li>very old man-ey.</li>
      <li>IT&#x27;s a very masculine feel to the scent.</li>
      <li>; It smells very classy and refined, without being too overbearing.</li>
      <li>My dad worked at Country Club when I was very young.</li>
      <li>It smell very masculine.  </li>
      <li>My Dad passed away at a very early age, and this was the cologne he used to wear.</li>
      <li>It lingers strong for only a little bit but comes back lightly throughout the day.</li>
      <li>I do worry a little about smelling like an old man, and perhaps I have gone from 13 year old girls to women who are 6x better:</li>
      <li>Will use the product up, and will most likely not re-order, especially if the classic Old Spice does the same for me.  </li>
      <li>it calms down quickly yet lasts until the evening if someone is very close to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I started cutting my own hair after going to a barber for 20 years that used the original Pinaud.</li>
      <li>This wasnt as widely used back in the day as Old Spice and Brut, those are more grandfather type.</li>
      <li>I guess since I&#x27;m getting old, I should start wearing this!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s old school!</li>
      <li>So this is a simple mixture with some recognizable stuff</li>
      <li>If it&#x27;s the same stuff I used to buy at the barber shop when I was 14 or 15, this is the first aftershave I used,  </li>
      <li>I used this aftershave for the first time last night.</li>
      <li>I had no idea the scent would be so linked to my past, but I&#x27;ve really enjoyed wearing it.</li>
      <li>He may not be able to act worth a crap, but he sure as hell carried himself like he did.</li>
      <li>When I put it on after shaving, it stung for a couple seconds but let me know I&#x27;m alive!</li>
      <li>How can the smell be the exact same as 45 years ago?</li>
      <li>The first time I splashed this on my face the thought that came to mind was I possibly just stuck my face into a hornets nest!</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>The third is that the unicorn that appeared after my first bottle won&#x27;t go away</li>
      <li>I remember my old barber, I was too young for  the shave, but remember haircut,  the powder and the tonic, The brush on back of the neck,&lt;br /&gt;The fresh haircut</li>
      <li>It starts more floral, and then dries to a unique scent that is difficult for me to describe.</li>
      <li>You will smell fresh all day long.</li>
      <li>And no, I&#x27;m not that old (still under 40)!  </li>
      <li>I switch back and forth between a straight razor, and a double-edged safety razor, and there&#x27;s no better way to finish off a classic shave, than with a healthy splash of Clubman.</li>
      <li>Not very effective, after shave you apply I feel good but not very concentrated</li>
      <li>It is quite strong, just a little bit will wake you up in the morning.</li>
      <li>Forget about the reviews that claim this will make you smell like an old man--if you want to smell like a teenager, buy Axe, but if you want to smell like a grown man, try a classic scent that has been around longer than anyone alive today.</li>
      <li>This after shave has a clean, traditional smell that reminds me of the Saturday morning haircuts I had as a kid way back in the 1960s.</li>
      <li>Aside from this and the Bay Rum I also used the Special Reserve and of the 3, this is the only one I would never wear in public.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Having tried Proraso first, I am going back now and staying clear of Pinaud</li>
      <li>As an everyday aftershave, this does the job and goes easy on the wallet.</li>
      <li>Just a quick splash in wet hands and apply to face.</li>
      <li>To be honest, sentimental scent is the only reason I bought this.</li>
      <li>Goes on kinda strong, but it mellows out a bit and stays for quite a few hours.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is advertised as masculine, but in my personal opinion smelling strongly of any product is not particularly manly.  </li>
      <li>Not until you&#x27;ve looked death squarely in the face, several times, and have been married long enough to understand there&#x27;s nothing really better, and not until you finally grow some real manners and stop dressing and acting like you just don&#x27;t give a damn.</li>
      <li>It is an acquired taste to wear this everyday sadly I do not have that taste right now maybe in 20 years.</li>
      <li>This is because even many unisex salons typically finish a haircut with Pinaud&#x27;s talcum powder, and this has some of the same smell.</li>
      <li>Over the last year or so, I have bought and used five different after shave lotions - Lucky Tiger, Proraso, Pinaud Clubman, and Captain&#x27;s Choice (Bay Rum and Sandalwood).</li>
      <li>But it cools your face and leaves it tight and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it does smell good but in public it may have people mistaking your swag as cheap vegas gambler which is clearly not the case.</li>
      <li>I gave this to him with his first straight razor and other shaving products.</li>
      <li>I was smart enough to start using this stuff when I was 15, and I still get compliments.  </li>
      <li>Not for teens, need to have lived a little to enjoy this.</li>
      <li>I like it but a little light on the scent for me.</li>
      <li>Not after using this you won&#x27;t because splashing it onto your face after a fresh shave fills each and everyone of your pores and cuts with little lemon squeezing ninjas who infuse a painful level of awesome into your morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am not a fan of the smell - a little more masculine than baby powder but definitely has a hint of it.</li>
      <li>Now for background, I do love the smells of some classic barber shop after shaves and shaving creams but this one isn&#x27;t the one for me.&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, this leaves your face very dry and tight.</li>
      <li>secret in the manufacturing process is rather amazing.</li>
      <li>Overall a great scent and for $6 a bottle you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
      <li>Would much rather go for the regular old spice after shave smell over this.</li>
      <li>The smell of this reminds me of what my old man used to smell like.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s the old school tonic type stuff.</li>
      <li>Reminds me of an old fashioned barbor shop.</li>
      <li>But there&#x27;s something about Clubman aftershave that makes me forget about unisex hair salons and makes me think of a barber shop (complete with the red and blue pole outside, sitting and reading papers and magazines until your turn in the chair comes up, and the sound of snipping scissors and the smalltalk you get from your barber.  </li>
      <li>it makes a complete after bath freshner.</li>
      <li>There is a fear among young guys of using fragrances of yesteryear, the &amp;#34;I&#x27;d smell like an old man&amp;#34; mentality.  </li>
      <li>Old school barber shop</li>
      <li>I should of paid attention to the reviews that said it smells like old man.</li>
      <li>Those looking for a old school aftershave, this is it.</li>

      <li>I never thot I had sensitive skin,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not an old guy.  </li>
      <li>It is mature but not &amp;#34;old man&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>It is not as fruity and obnoxious as old spice.</li>
      <li>I like the way it smells because I like old school stuff</li>
      <li>and this is as old school as it gets.  </li>
      <li>I was worried about the smell of this aftershave as I have never used it but was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
      <li>Wow.</li>
      <li>It truly is classy in the sense that you smell like a gentleman who just got cleaned up for a day with his gal.</li>
      <li>smell is that of the old school.  </li>
      <li>and then you find yourself dabbing some on your 1 and 1/2 year old son so you can both smell manly</li>
      <li>It has a classic,clean, masculine scent that lingers without being over powering.</li>
      <li>It stings, it burns, but not too much - just enough to let you know that you are a man.  </li>
      <li>a stuffy old grandpa coat closet.\\</li>
      <li>; that comes from tree moss, but I only really smell that separately in the bottle.</li>
      <li>I can definitely feel when I put it on, but it doesn&#x27;t sting... much.</li>
      <li>After I apply it I go back over my face with a hydrating face lotion made by Lo&#x27;real.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although it does seem to remind me of the barber shop days, but no where near does it make me say &amp;#34;I&#x27;m truly a man.&amp;#34; - By Dr. StrangeBrew &amp;#34;marekjjones&amp;#34;</li>

      <li>Clubman Pinaud is an old school, old time barbershop, after shave/cologne.</li>
      <li>Old timey natural scents.  </li>
      <li>something much farther back...</li>
      <li>My dad used this and it seems some scents never get old.</li>
      <li>Bougt this for my 96 year old dad at his request.</li>
      <li>Old Spice, Clubman, Aqua Velva, and Barbasol.  </li>
      <li>I rediscovered the old after shaves and haven&#x27;t looked back.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never frequented an old school barbershop, but that seems to be the consensus on the smell.  </li>
      <li>LIke an old time barber shop.</li>
      <li>Smells like the barber shop and drives the ladies with (grand-)daddy issues wild.</li>
      <li>I read all the reviews for this product and wanted to try it for a change from my OLD SPICE regimen ...</li>
      <li>MASCULINE, BUT STINGY</li>
      <li>My old man likes it.  </li>
      <li>It helps with razor burn, sensitive skin, and also serves as a moisteurizer.</li>
      <li>This stuff is totally old school.</li>
      <li>After you use it, it smells like you stepped out if an old timey barber shop.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll smell like a man, not like a 13 year old boy.</li>
      <li>phew, stanky and every time I get near anyone wearing it, it even rubs off on me and stays with all day till I take a shower and change cloth, like running into a skunk.</li>
      <li>Clubman reminds me of back in the day, old time barber shops that would apply Clubman after giving you an old fashioned straight edge shave.</li>
      <li>Old school barbershop + Country Club +</li>
      <li>Smells like an old time barber shop, where everyone is your friend.</li>
      <li>Smells like 50 years of old man.</li>
      <li>I used to see Clubman at the drugstore (in glass bottles) but at the time I was an Old Spice and Aramis guy.</li>
      <li>When you put it onto your face and your ass will pucker, but the tingling lets you know your alive.</li>
      <li>The type of barber shop that the WWII vet is waiting to kick some young punks ass with his cane for walking in with sagging pants.</li>
      <li>Old mannish?</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m 50 and don&#x27;t want to smell like a 19 year old going into a Justin Bieber concert.</li>
      <li>Reminds me of an old barber shop.</li>
      <li>Old time barbershop fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
      <li>It smells classy.</li>
      <li>As a young man living in France, a university student, I would splurge once every couple of months with a haircut and a shave in a barbershop.  </li>
      <li>It has the old school smell of a shave.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t know what the &#x27;old barber shop smell&#x27; smells like.</li>
      <li>Old Spice and this is irresistible.</li>
      <li>old school Joe da Barba</li>
      <li>It does burn a bit going on but hasn&#x27;t caused any problems to my quite sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m completely amazed that I haven&#x27;t heard of this sooner.</li>
      <li>I like the masculine smell a lot</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for an old fashioned after shave, this is for you.</li>
      <li>It reminds me of the old days when men were men.</li>
      <li>That is my least favorite scent of all time and</li>
      <li>like the smell (which fades fairly early on)</li>
      <li>Clubman is the smell of an old school barber shop.</li>
      <li>My wife won&#x27;t even come near me until this evaporates.  </li>
      <li>Does soothe the skin though, and your wife might find the smell of an old guy alluring.</li>
      <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll try the straight razor next?</li>
      <li>You will smell like you just came out of an old barbershop.  </li>
      <li>Its scent comes too close to \\&quot;old</li>
      <li>Reminds me of the old days when we went to a barber for hair cut.</li>
      <li>After reading the reviews about Clubman Pinaud smelling like the barber shops of old I decided to give it a try.</li>
      <li>Smells like a cologne a 15 year old boy would pour all over himself.</li>
      <li>Heck, splash some on midday so you can feel alive again.    </li>
      <li>Pardon the Old Spice reference, but I had to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The scent is quite dapper and reminds me of an old barber shop.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for my customers after all straight razor shaves, but I think I&#x27;m going to switch it up for the my next after shave purchase.</li>
      <li>The only after shave I have really used.</li>
      <li>So if you have sensitive skin be warned.</li>
      <li>Classy.</li>
      <li>be surprised if the ladies notice your smell before your three wolf moon t-shirt aura.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I could see it having some zings if you have sensitive skin or are prone to nicking yourself.</li>
      <li>Ordered third time really like it.</li>
      <li>Clubman is old school.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not an old timer</li>
      <li>Smells like an old timey barber shop.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The only after shave / cologne you really need, without spending</li>
      <li>Old school barbershop smell.</li>
      <li>have sensitive skin and have not any problems using this product.</li>
      <li>Try the Old Spice.  </li>
      <li>Fast forward years later, and I&#x27;m trying to move up in my company.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a old fashioned masculine smell.</li>
      <li>I do really love this stuff and have not received a negative comment from anyone regarding the aroma, in fact, quite the contrary.</li>
      <li>Smells like root beer, old ladies, diapers, and plastic</li>
      <li>(I have a proraso and old spice</li>
      <li>You see that pimping action figure on the bottle?  </li>
      <li>Its an old timer product but will never get old for me.</li>
      <li>Old time barbershop smell.  </li>
      <li>i higly recomend the product you will feel young again and renewed</li>
      <li>Old, musty and sweetish.</li>
      <li>My wife&#x27;s #1 complain on this after shave lotion is the smell of \\&quot;old man\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>I apply witch hazel after I shave and then apply pinaud a few minutes later and love this combination.</li>
      <li>Alas, it gave me a headache, as most aftershaves do, and has been given to a friend, who absolutely loves it.</li>
      <li>I tried it a few times to be sure, and each time it caused red blotches on my face.</li>
      <li>the slight sting with the first splash tells you that the bracer is working leaving you feeling invigorated and ready to go.  </li>
      <li>Burns a little, but totally worth it!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Lastly, if I didn&#x27;t see such a big deal being made of the alcohol sting in so many reviews (not just here, but other aftershaves too)</li>
      <li>/&gt;Lastly, if I didn&#x27;t see such a big deal being made of the alcohol sting in so many reviews (not just here, but other aftershaves too)</li>
      <li>Women seem to enjoy it as they are subconsciously attracted (due to evolutionary beginnings).</li>
      <li>Also, when an after shave causes any razor burns and minor cuts to sting, I feel like I am doing something positive to treat them,</li>
      <li>although, it is heavy on the cinniman, Dominica Original Bay Rum.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like colones and prefer the more subtle aftershaves.  </li>
      <li>A lot of people I know use the mainstream after shave lotion, but I&#x27;ve received various compliments from using this classic after shave lotion.</li>
      <li>I just started straight shaving not too long ago and needed an aftershave that would &amp;#34;calm&amp;#34; my sensitive skin after the shave.</li>
      <li>Such a classic smell.</li>
      <li>Well, this stuff had so many 5 star reviews but with such a small price, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.  </li>
      <li>At the beginning, the smell is a little strong, but after several times use, i got used to the smell.</li>
      <li>Scent dries down nicely and hangs around for a few hours.</li>
      <li>The price is low but the quality is high.  </li>
      <li>This is becoming hard to find in the drug stores.</li>
      <li>Clubman Pinaud is the new old man standard.  </li>
      <li>If you say bro, tight, or take selfies, get some axe body spray you arent worthy.</li>
      <li>When I decided spray on colognes were generally easier and more convenient than having my splash-on aftershave pull double duty, ended up using the regular clubman a lot less often.</li>
      <li>- deep down you feel you&#x27;re old enough and ready for something as powerful as Clubman Pinaud</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s all win; if you two aren&#x27;t that serious, it&#x27;s a small purchase.</li>
      <li>It works well to stop any minor weepers you might have, and the scent is classic, old school barbershop.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;However, here is a word of advice to anyone who is new to old-school wetshaving: if you really want to reduce skin irritation after shaving with a blade, don&#x27;t use this, or any other alcohol-based aftershave.  </li>
      <li>The product&#x27;s smell reminds me a little of either classic Old Spice or Stetson aftershaves (can&#x27;t really remember which...</li>
      <li>Slight burn, refreshing aroma and lasts longer then other after shaves I&#x27;ve used although don&#x27;t confuse it with a cologne.</li>
      <li>This coincided with giving up my double edge, safety razor for the newly advertised &amp;#34;triple blade, disposable razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>even if you have to buy their entire lineup to find one you like, it would still be cheaper than most of those trendy expensive brands that smell great but feel terrible after a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is much more complex and refined than aqua velva or similar by-the-gallon, sanitizer after shaves.</li>
      <li>exactly like I just got out of an extra long gym class</li>
      <li>However its fallen off that list of late because there is one problem with a distinctive unusual aftershave that&#x27;s strong smelling enough to double as a cologne</li>
      <li>Immediately after applying it, I was transported back to barber shops with straight edge razors and combs soaking in blue barbicide.  </li>
      <li>Sharp sting when first applied, so stay away if you don&#x27;t like that.  </li>
      <li>Although this works fantastically as an aftershave, and I&#x27;ll probably never be without a bottle, this is definitely below 4711 Aftershave and Pinaud&#x27;s Vanilla Clubman for me personally now, because they do a better job of letting my spray cologne (usually Azzaro Pour Homme or Cerruti 1881) do its job.</li>
      <li>As my first aftershave, I will probably explore other options to decide whether or not I like Clubman.</li>
      <li>People say it dries down to a powdery smell, but to me the powdery smell is the initial smell, which goes away thankfully, and leaves the masterpiece behind which lasts a great amount of time by the way</li>
      <li>Scent is a tad strong when initially slapped on but soon fades and not overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>Classic and lasts long.</li>
      <li>It may burn a little but it is worth it.  </li>
      <li>You can not find a better value anywhere; Clubman is a solid mainstay for any serious shave den.</li>
      <li>, you got a lotta boot left to fill.\\&quot; Clubman smells classic, traditional, and manly.  </li>
      <li>should have had some free flowing nozzle type neck, The current opening hole pours around the edge of bottle sometimes so bit tough to collect and as this product has benzene it vapourizes very soon.</li>
      <li>General Baddassery.&lt;br /&gt;Too</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a very distince scent, but it doesn&#x27;t linger forever, just long enough.</li>
      <li>Like getting in a time machine and going back to an old school barber shop.</li>
      <li>The second thing Pinaud is known for is making you smell, &amp;#34;like an old guy&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Bring back some old memories when your dad took you to the barbershop for that burr cut</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 44 and this reminds me of the barber shop I got my haircuts back in the early 70&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I used to apply old spice after shave but for some reason I stopped applying after shave for the last 5 yrs.</li>
      <li>I have, as I mentioned, über sensitive skin, and this has an initial, invigorating heat to it, but it doesn&#x27;t burn at all.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know that a youngster could carry this off, but if you&#x27;re old enough to wear a beret without looking like you&#x27;re in costume, this would work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>/&gt;It brings back memories of an old barbershop....</li>
      <li>Takes you back to the old barber shop days.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used everything from Taylor Of Old Bond Street, Myrsol Blue, Jovan ...... ect.</li>
      <li>While I find the odor pleasing and timeless, apparently, it reminds women of their grandfathers.  </li>
      <li>A professional doctor or lawyer would likely be happier with something from an upscale dept store.</li>
      <li>While your face is a bit wet, put 2 shakes of the lotion in the palm of your hand and gently apply to face and neck.</li>
      <li>while not overpowering yet it isn&#x27;t completely gone after say 20 mins outside.  </li>
      <li>Am I the only person here who thinks this stuff smells just like Old Spice?</li>
      <li>Sure, Clubman is like a thousand tiny daggers stabbing your face, but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
      <li>You will likely be surprised as well.</li>
      <li>If you had an irritating shave, it will sting a bit more.  </li>
      <li>so yes, I still use it, but honestly it&#x27;s just kinda weird because I feel like I&#x27;m splashing on bottled cat urine.</li>
      <li>I had been using some kind of expensive froo-froo stuff  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a little bite when you apply any alcohol-based aftershave right after shaving, but who cares.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a little bite when you apply any alcohol-based aftershave right after shaving, but who cares.  </li>
      <li>I use it fairly sparingly and actually only use on half my face while I use Proraso refresh on the other half</li>
      <li>I used this aftershave for the first time today when i purchased it with a single bladed razor and some other products for a new shaving regimen.</li>
      <li>It is fresh, crisp, starts out sharp and then tones down to an almost baby powder smell and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>Much like the other reviews- definite old time barber shop feel.  </li>
      <li>This is the only fragrance that I consistently receive compliments on and that has never happened with any other cologne/fragrance in my life.</li>
      <li>I agree with other reviewers, this is a very manly fragrance.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very affordable but it beats any other aftershave on the market at any price.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;i use also other prouducts  from Pinaud&lt;br /&gt;item came fast.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;After the first use, I had 10 different women at work give me their phone numbers, and two more send me dirty pictures via email.  </li>
      <li>I love the way it feels on my face but the scent is a little heavy for me.</li>
      <li>This smell reminds me of a fresh haircut that I got as a little boy at the local barber shop.</li>
      <li>I also find the scent quite strong; I usually rinse my face a few minutes after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, it gets 4 stars from me, mainly because it works so well as an after shave product.  </li>
      <li>I had to order, Not a single regret either.</li>
      <li>A great product standing firm in an industry that is being plastered by all sorts of random things.</li>
      <li>Have also gotten my 70 year old father back on the double edge and sent this to him.</li>
      <li>That in itself doesn&#x27;t seem so bad except it is REALLY strong and it stays strong for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So either this smells great or my cologne stinks!</li>
      <li>Has a tiny bit of a burn, but for me it&#x27;s barely there.</li>
      <li>but then again i always shower with hot shower and use heavy bar soap on my face</li>
      <li>Recently started wet shaving and wanted something classic to follow the shaving process with.</li>
      <li>and I find it actually really cuts down on razor burn/nicks.</li>
      <li>first, when you open the bottle and splash it on your hands the scent is  a little skunky.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had sensitive skin or or a dry skin problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Has a bit of an old man smell, but it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
      <li>But this is a good scent for the average guy or practically anyone else on a casual, weekend / vacation.</li>
      <li>I have had very sensitive skin shaving for as long as I can remember to the point that I really only shaved once every third day or so and only with the grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I picked up a bottle of Clubmans at my local pharmacy one day not long after breaking up with my girlfriend.</li>
      <li>I wanted to try a new after shave lotion since I recently began wet shaving.</li>
      <li>I thought it was going to be this tiny little thing, but it is quite large about the size of a stick deodorant.</li>
      <li>If you spent any amount of time in a barbershop, you&#x27;ll be familiar with the scent as Clubman Pinaud is the usual go-to aftershave in those establishments.</li>
      <li>I was a little disappointed by this based on all the great reviews mainly because I built it up to be different.  </li>
      <li>a picture of you in your new car the other day, looking Pinaud!&amp;#34; (Pronounced Pee-No)&lt;br</li>
      <li>i was shocked how fast it arrived and that i was still able to buy it on amazon</li>

<li> The great thing about the CC Bay Rum though, is the ingredients.</li>
<li> This stuff is great.  </li>
<li> A great smell use for lotion/ sterilizing since shaving cuts off 2-3 layers of skin off</li>
<li> the days that I use Clubman, I get questions and comments from the women in the office about how great it smells and what it is.  </li>
<li> Our Great Grandads knew something</li>
<li> Definitely a great buy.....</li>
<li> It is an inexpensive but great product.</li>
<li> It soothes and works great..</li>
<li> Taylor&#x27;s\\&quot; aftershave balm) does not change often, but I&#x27;ve looked longingly at alcohol-based aftershaves, thinking \\&quot;I wish my über-sensitive skin could handle that, but I&#x27;d probably just start on fire, no matter how great it smelled or worked\\&quot;.</li>
<li> Great buy.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not a truly great cologne like you&#x27;d get from a great Jermyn street perfumer like Floris or Penhaligon, but it&#x27;s manly agreeable, and suggests old-fashioned propriety and democratic refinement.</li>
<li> Great feeling and smell</li>
<li> Great price also.</li>
<li> A great aftershave that will wake you up because of the alchohol.</li>
<li> Great old-time barbershop smell, but doesn&#x27;t smell like &amp;#34;old</li>

<li> This aftershave is truly amazing.</li>
<li> It has done a great job making my skin taught and oil free.</li>
<li> It smells great (Like a barber shop) and it cools and heals razor burn and makes your skin smooth.</li>
<li> Do not hesitate on buying it, because it is cheap and smells great.</li>
<li> The scent seems to be something that could suit almost anyone, but probably wouldn&#x27;t be a great fit for some.</li>
<li> and then it soaks in and feels amazing.  </li>
<li> This is one of the cheapest aftershaves I use, and it holds it own.  </li>
<li> So I bought my own and</li>
<li> but I can&#x27;t get it out of my head that it kind of smells like a mix of shaving cream and sun tan lotion.</li>

<li> Good refreshing feel after a shave.  </li>
<li> It smells nice, but can be overpowering unlike the vanilla.</li>

<li> Nice.</li>
<li> and then you kind of like it...</li>
<li> There is alcohol, so you get a nice burn.</li>
<li> This is absolutely the best aftershave I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
<li> This stuff is really, really nice.</li>
<li> Nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> &quot;  I still liked it.  </li>
<li> Is it popular with senior citizens?</li>
<li> /&gt;Would make a nice Xmas gift for the man in your life</li>
<li> When splashing it on it invigorates you after shaving and has a sauve, gentlemanly, scent all of its own.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;ve always walked my own path.  </li>
<li> /&gt;It has a nice sting to it, after splashing on after a close shave.  </li>
<li> I purchased this based on good reviews on Amazon but didnt find it that interesting that I&#x27;ll buy it again</li>
<li> Nice feel when you apply it to your face after the shave.</li>
<li> It may be that it has become popular and to fill the orders they&#x27;ve diluted the formula.</li>
<li> Most say that it smells so good that they want to buy some for their husbands.&lt;br</li>
<li> A great smell that is cheaper than most of the most popular blends.</li>
<li> The smell is kind of old-school which he likes</li>

<li> The best part, it is inexpensive and very blue-collaresque</li>
<li> Feels nice on</li>
<li> It is nice smelling like a man.</li>
<li> A nice, inexpensive alternative to cologne.</li>
<li> /&gt;Overall, I think all of the Clubman products are great at soothing your face after a shave, better than most</li>
<li> Smells nice and manly.</li>
<li> I have always loved the smell of this brand and continue to love it clients love it and gives them that fresh out of the barber shop smell and feel awesome product</li>
<li> The best way I found to find out what this really smells like if you&#x27;re unsure what you&#x27;ll smell like to others</li>
<li> Tweezerman badger shave brush, C.O. Bigelow (Proraso) shave cream and VDH Deluxe</li>
<li> Has a nice bite to it with the alcohol in it.</li>
<li> I honestly couldn&#x27;t resist--I leaned into him and said, \\&quot;Is</li>
<li> Kind of like you just did</li>
<li> I imagined dozens of cute Bettys coming out of the trees and bumps, crowding around him, sniffing his chest and shoulders, and oohing and ahhing about how good he smelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> But my Dad liked it</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve found this to be an effective way to wake me up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> and it seems to leave my skin feeling fairly nice after the burning has subsided.</li>
<li> I&#x27;d prefer a nice bottle of bay rum or mentholated aftershave over this any day.</li>
<li> Smells nice too</li>
<li> Proraso and Colonel Conk make wonderful, very affordable soaps.)</li>
<li> Outstanding smell and superior feel after shave with DE razor.  </li>
<li> Smells like the kind your grandpa had.</li>
<li> and i would have to apply my own moisturizer.</li>
<li> I mix it with witch hazel and some lotion to make a really nice aftershave balm.  </li>
<li> This aftershave feels really nice on my skin, however the scent just isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
<li> I was very close to my grandfather, so anything that reminds me of him is wonderful.</li>
<li> commented on how nice the aroma was.</li>
<li> Absolutely the best after shave</li>
<li> It leaves a nice scent on his skin.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s a very nice clean and musky smell.</li>
<li> Great scent but seems to fade quickly.</li>
<li> Great mild smell reminds me of Canoe.</li>
<li> Comes on strong with a good burn.</li>
<li> This aftershave is very strong.</li>
<li> The scent starts off very strong.</li>
<li> Soothing, but has a very strong scent.</li>
<li> Very strong fragrance and dries out my skin.  </li>
<li> Impressed with it so far</li>
<li> Good cheap aftershave.</li>
<li> This is nice, I ordered it off Amazon because everything in the store has so many ingredients.  </li>
<li> Brush on that old school shaving soap with the perfect brush.</li>
<li> Goes perfectly with 100+ year old razors.</li>
<li> Just an all around great, fresh, relaxing feel &amp; aroma.</li>
<li> Excellent stuff old time Barber Shop.</li>
<li> Great after shave lotion makes your skin feel fresh.</li>
<li> cmon anyone remember this as  young kid at the barber shop, its the greatest</li>
<li> I think this may be my best so far as scent.</li>
<li> I wish there was a cologne with this scent, because I really do love it, but it&#x27;s just not that effective as an aftershave.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s definitely an old man smell, but in the best way.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s even more amazing.</li>
<li> Best amongst all the after shave lotion I have used so far.</li>
<li> just confirmed to me that I was on to a good thing....</li>
<li> Nice scent good price fast shipping good seller</li>
<li> The best way I can think of to describe the smell of Axe, and alot of these new cologne&#x27;s and sprays out there is to paraphrase one of my favorite songs and say \\&quot;Boy</li>
<li> if it bombs I don&#x27;t have to suffer all day with it).&lt;br /&gt;After the alcohol flashed off and the essence warmed on my skin the most pleasant aroma filled the room, but not overpowering.</li>
<li> You get a plastic bottle, but who cares (surely a glass one would be more stylish)!</li>
<li> The smell is a pleasant one, so it&#x27;s not bad if it is anyway.</li>
<li> A good clean smell, without being overpowering or cloying.</li>
<li> The scent of this aftershave is great, and the alcohol provides a great antiseptic quality that kills any bacteria that may be left from the shave.  </li>
<li> After it dries, it leaves my skin good and clean.</li>
<li> The Clubman Pinaud aftershave has a good, clean, manly smell;</li>
<li> Good clean feel after applying.</li>
<li> Good, clean feel and smell; doesn&#x27;t overpower the room, but my wife likes it.  </li>
<li> This has a very strong and refreshing scent.</li>
<li> No, I don&#x27;t wear it, but I buy it, and I know of no other aftershave that smells as delicious as Clubman.</li>
<li> good product I like the original stronger scent better,</li>
<li> this aftershave was exactly what I wanted I would recommended this product to anyone, it is soothing when applied after shaving and smells great</li>
<li> It&#x27;s cool n smells good.</li>
<li> It burns at first, but leaves the skin very smooth and smells great</li>
<li> Love this, a good clean sent.</li>
<li> smells pretty nice - sort of like Brut, not as bright but soapier/cleaner scent.</li>
<li> So a good after shaved seemed a worthy product to try, and it works.  </li>
<li> Great positive reviews.</li>
<li> This product leaves your face feeling clean and refreshed after a shave and is especially good at preventing irritation / redness and does a decent job at coagulating the blood of any nicks you may have.&lt;br</li>
<li> Got to love an aftershave that says flammable on the label.</li>
<li> I love the sting.</li>
<li> Clubman makes me skydive better.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
<li> I like a bay rum after shave better</li>
<li> Famous product used by barbers for over a century.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s awesome in the sent last all day</li>
<li> that was because it leaked most of it&#x27;s contents while in the shipping process.  </li>
<li> oh and i love it too.</li>
<li> I am 22-years-old and I love this stuff.</li>
<li> Gives you confidence and makes you feel more dignified; almost puts a bounce in your step.</li>
<li> too many shirts have been sold.  </li>
<li> This timeless barbershop smell creates just that smell and is even better when paired with [[ASIN:B0007MW2ZW</li>
<li> but I love this product.</li>
<li> I use this at night before bed and in the mornings, the scent lingers but is mostly gone (thankfully).</li>
<li> I will by more when this is gone.</li>
<li> Stick to the basics -- there&#x27;s a reason most barbers use this stuff.</li>
<li> Smells OK.</li>
<li> I would buy again for sure, but will have to wait until wife has lost sense of smell.</li>
<li> another product I have used for many years, was alway a favorite at the barber shop.  </li>
<li> I really love this stuff.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s made of plastic (ok, cheaper) and it doesn&#x27;t travel well.  </li>
<li> My wife likes the smell and I received many complements.</li>
<li> /&gt;The smell is... ok.</li>
<li> one more thing, it leaves a touch like a powder on the skin with smooooooth touch.</li>
<li> , I remember this smell SO well from my childhood, worn by all of my favorite men.  </li>
<li> The price is outstanding and it&#x27;s something he can wear at any age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Except women shouldn&#x27;t be shaving their faces and if they are, they have a lot more to worry about than aftershave.</li>
<li> Today most men get their hair cut in places with the words Uni or Clips in their names.</li>
<li> and I don&#x27;t like most scents.  </li>
<li> This has become on of my favorite aftershaves.  </li>
<li> Guess what I get the most compliments on when I wear them.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this for over 30 years, I am glad people are still discovering it.</li>
<li> More of a nostalgia item for me.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had many compliments from many women while wearing it, and for me that counts for more than all the advertising money can buy.</li>
<li> Really Stingy and smells great.</li>
<li> I will definately be buying more when he runs out.</li>
<li> Thanks for a great product.</li>
<li> but in time I&#x27;m sure they will.</li>
<li> Bravo Zulu to Clubman for not changing their formula in a day when so many are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Mostly all barbers use this brand.  </li>
<li> Nothing more</li>
<li> I read the wonderful reviews and so I went to my local CVS Pharmacy and picked up a bottle.  </li>
<li> and then you love it</li>
<li> I love it.</li>
<li> The powder is much better.</li>
<li> My wife made a comment also about how potent the smell was.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t feel this was the most manly after shave</li>
<li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what my wife would think but she complimented me on the scent.</li>
<li> Sure.</li>
<li> This is not my absolute favorite fragrance (Muelhen&#x27;s 4711 is my very favorite), and its not my very favorite Pinaud product (I like the Vanilla Clubman even better)</li>
<li> but I love this stuff</li>
<li> Not a lot of burn, and it really does have a great smell.</li>
<li> And damned if I don&#x27;t love this aftershave.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve got more than my share of gray hair already, but</li>
<li> i love the scent of this.</li>
<li> Refreshing.</li>
<li> Love the refreshing smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I love this stuff.  </li>
<li> My wife likes it better than the bottle of [[ASIN:</li>
<li> I love the way this smells on my husband.</li>
<li> With a product that&#x27;s been around for 200 years, can you find a better recommendation?</li>
<li> I&#x27;m glad this is not a mainstream product</li>
<li> My favorite aftershave fragrance of all time.</li>
<li> I was expecting the scent to linger most of the day.  </li>
<li> But I do not feel any better than after I used Geo Trumper  Coral Skin Food  </li>
<li> This is the lotion that was used in barbar shops when he was ayoung man and it has not changed in 80 years or more.</li>
<li> It is your favorite barbershop in a bottle.</li>
<li> It was just an OK lotion.</li>
<li> I love the scent.</li>
<li> The bottle is also made of plastic so safe to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> This is the scent I use most often.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m glad I got this,</li>
<li> They can also work well as colognes if you&#x27;re not one to spend the buck on &amp;#34;flower water&amp;#34; like many.</li>
<li> Love everything about this aftershave but the container.</li>
<li> He really likes this shave lotion, and I think it smells great.</li>
<li> I love the smell of this lotion.  </li>
<li> If you love that old-time barbershop smell of talc, you will love this product.  </li>
<li> OK, if you say so dear.  </li>
<li> Bought this product to help with my razor burn and bumps, and after all of my skepticism I am really glad that I decided to purchase this after shave.</li>
<li> I came across this while looking for something else and remembered this as my favorite aftershave</li>
<li> I use the talc every night - just love the scent.  </li>
<li> I have both Pinaud and Proraso and I like Pinaud better.</li>
<li> It smells better.</li>
<li> I think about a cat litter box everytime I put it on  :)  </li>
<li> I do like the fact that Proraso has more of a &amp;#34;lotiony&amp;#34; feel to it though.</li>
<li> I love this stuff and so does my fiance.</li>
<li> I absolutely love Clubman Pinaud</li>
<li> You want to smell more grown up?</li>
<li> and I doubt you could get more old-school than a brand that has been around for over 200 years.&lt;br</li>
<li> I love the way this stuff smells</li>
<li> I love the smell and the way it makes my face feel.</li>
<li> , it&#x27;s more of a powder smell.</li>
<li> That is probably why so many barbers swear by the stuff.</li>
<li> I love this stuff and it is really refreshing.</li>
<li> Absolutely love the smell of this stuff.</li>
<li> Love this stuff.</li>
<li> Hopefully you have better luck than I do.</li>
<li> Love this stuff.</li>
<li> I love the smell.  </li>
<li> I love the smell of this stuff.</li>
<li> Seems to do ok as an after shave as in helping with razor burn...</li>
<li> Smells like Grand Dad.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
<li> bit too much alcohol for an &amp;#34;aftershave&amp;#34; (can sting, a lot), but the scent is great.</li>
<li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite product that I use.</li>
<li> Absolutely LOVE the old-school smell of this stuff.</li>
<li> so YOU won&#x27;t be able to smell</li>
<li> A lot :)</li>
<li> It works .. refreshing ..</li>
<li> It will wake you up in the morning and smells much better than today&#x27;s after shave&#x27;s and cologne&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
<li> It&#x27;s FANTASTIC!</li>
<li> Love the smell.  </li>
<li> My assumption is that it&#x27;s made better by the memory I have associated with it</li>
<li> Love this after shave.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
<li> LOVE</li>
<li> &quot; the handsome man with irresistible aromas emanating from his body said.</li>
<li> The smell wasn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; as I had hoped it would be but it wasn&#x27;t overwhelming either.  </li>
<li> It is easier on the skin than most aftershaves.  </li>
<li> I love the smell of a barbershop</li>
<li> I love the smell of Clubman aftershave.</li>
<li> Get a brush, a single-blade double-edge razor (Merkur from Germany is a good place to start), some old school barber shop cream, like Proraso from Italy, and a good aftershave like this one.  </li>
<li> Wait til you see how much better it all works.</li>
<li> I love this stuff.</li>
<li> I love the way it feels and smells.</li>
<li> I love Clubman Pinaud</li>
<li> These products cost a bit more, but are dramatically better at soothing your skin after shaving.  </li>
<li> I guess greatness costs 5 or 10 times more.</li>
<li> A lumberjack would probably want something more manly.</li>
<li> Now many on here claim this stuff burn like lava.</li>
<li> I love the feel on my face when I splash it on.  </li>
<li> My husband and I discovered this aftershave many, many years ago.</li>
<li> I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
<li> I love the smell which is somewhere between, or a combination of barber shop, baby powder, and Dapper Dan.  </li>
<li> I love this stuff.</li>
<li> What more can I say?</li>
<li> but that is a Strong/Overpowering scent which may not always be appropriate in all situations tho</li>
<li> as I like to use this together with a dash of Eau De Quinine hair tonic if I need a dash of something just a bit stronger and have been complimented by ladies many times.  </li>
<li> Anyway, Im sure I will be buying more of this Clubman.</li>
<li> Perfect for after using a double edged safety razor - and if you&#x27;re not, you should.  </li>
<li> Got it for the boyfriend and I love the smell</li>
<li> I absolutely love the smell.  </li>
<li> Love this stuff.  </li>
<li> Now close your eyes and think about how good you feel with a fresh haircut and that glorious barbershop smell permeating your nostrils as you stroll out the door.  </li>
<li> Too many women are now requiring it.</li>
<li> I absolutely love the Clubman Pinaud \\&quot;regular\\&quot; scent.</li>
<li> It smells OK.</li>
<li> always did love the smell of this after shave.</li>
<li> This is some potent stuff.</li>
<li> If you were to wear this stuff at work you would probably be accussed of sexual harassment as soon as you walked into a room.</li>
<li> Instead, it&#x27;s more like a cleaning product or an herbal/natural bug repellant.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s probably the most like a skin conditioner.</li>
<li> Its aloe vera plus I suspect witch hazel are what make me say it is most like a skin conditioner.</li>
<li> I would say that Pinaud Clubman is the most astringent and cooling, followed by Proraso, Clubman&#x27;s Bay Rum, and Clubman&#x27;s Sandalwood.</li>
<li> even if another after shave might help them heal better without your feeling anything.</li>
<li> So, the more astringency the better for me.</li>
<li> Smells OK, but wife did not care for it.</li>
<li> Will definitely buy again with this superb price.</li>
<li> I love this scent and now think of him whenever I smell it.</li>
<li> I also use a cream style aftershave on top of this to soften skin sometimes.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s refreshing and invigorates in the morning.  </li>
<li> the smell is still overwhelming after 20 minutes.  </li>
<li> Smells great and really prevents razor burn.</li>
<li> I like it, but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
<li> It is an ok aftershave, and quite frankly, it is not something I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
<li> Love the smell.</li>
<li> Wife says she likes it better than the Proraso.</li>
<li> It leaves my face cleaner and most, if not all, the tightness goes away.</li>
<li> Perfect compliment to safety razor shaving for the ultimate barber shop shave.</li>
<li> I couldn&#x27;t disagree more.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve become more and more OK with the smell</li>
<li> I love the smell of this stuff.</li>
<li> it is potent but reminds me of my grand pa.</li>
<li> Like most after-shaves, though, you will feel the burn when it contacts any cuts or nicks you&#x27;ve given yourself shaving.</li>
<li> I love this.</li>
<li> but I like the skin food products better for soothing.</li>
<li> It does burn as all the reviews state but its not terrible.  </li>
<li> This has a fabulous scent!  </li>
<li> Brought back wonderful memories.  </li>
<li> This aftershave has a nice understated fragrance that wont break the bank, Enjoy.</li>
<li> Maybe woodsy, but not fireplace wood, more like walking through a forest.</li>
<li> But not office suit and tie, more Bond like suit and tie.</li>
<li> Anyone that grew up going to the Barbershop  will remember and love this smell.</li>
<li> I could not be more satisfied.</li>
<li> It does feel refreshing.</li>
<li> this is the most valuable purchase i&#x27;ve made on amazon.</li>
<li> factor in the low price, refreshing feeling, and perfect balance in fragrance</li>
<li> Love it.</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t used too many after shaves to compare it to, but it does the job for me.</li>
<li> There is a refreshing burn when it covers your shaving nicks.</li>
<li> here you go, this is the world famous scent.</li>
<li> i love it, and it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
<li> a refreshing, yet not overpowering manly smell.</li>
<li> I love the way this makes my face feel.</li>
<li> I love it .  </li>
<li> many guys my age would care for.</li>
<li> What more could you ask for?</li>
<li> You better like the smell</li>
<li> ordering more, love it</li>
<li> Unlike most aftershaves and colognes, you must use soap and water to wash the scent off.</li>
<li> it is how refreshing the feel and scent is.  </li>
<li> :)  </li>
<li> My wife and kids love the smell of this stuff.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
<li> and then you will understand why this is a top selling aftershave on Amazon.</li>
<li> Said it was ok, but I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;ll be using it.</li>
<li> I love this stuff.  </li>
<li> I love it though.</li>
<li> I follow it with an aftershave balm to make sure the alcohol doesn&#x27;t dehydrate my face.</li>
<li> These comments by Clubman users are hilarious.  </li>
<li> I have always used many of the drug store aftershaves because i shave every day and go through allot of it.  </li>
<li> and man i love it.  </li>
<li> Will order some more when I run out.</li>
<li> Not only is this the BEST after shave lotion I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;I would recommend better than perfume coz of acne..</li>
<li> but  many things in life that are oh</li>
<li> i smell sucess T :)</li>
<li> The nice things that I can say about Clubman are that it is good for your skin, and the price is very affordable.</li>
<li> This is a very popular aftershave that I really wanted to like</li>
<li> This is an oldtime scent that is clean and masculine and this lotion makes your skin feel great!</li>
<li> Clubman Pinaud smells like nostalgia: warm, friendly, and pleasing.</li>
<li> A very nice scent that reminds me of the olde-time barber shop smells when I was a boy, and haircuts were quick, cheap, and easy.</li>
<li> It cools your face and has that great, classic, barber shop scent you&#x27;ll remember.  </li>
<li> Attracts older an women like flys to fly paper.</li>
<li> Smells great, classic scent.</li>
<li> I was hoping it would have a nice clean smell to it ( maybe like Proraso shaving cream)</li>
<li> It has a nice, clean, just came from the barber shop scent.</li>
<li> it is just a classic man smell and is a great product for the price.</li>
<li> I suspect this product has a high level of alcohol which is great for killing bacteria, but the sting irritates some of the customers.</li>
<li> Feels good on the skin after shaving, essentially cured my ingrown hairs and breakouts after shaving and has a pleasant aroma.</li>
<li> And I like the smell of it - very clean smelling.</li>
<li> Has a very clean scent and cools the face.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s like finding a great tasting wine that you&#x27;d normally have to pay $25 for $5.</li>
<li> All Pinaud products are pretty good.</li>
<li> I would say it&#x27;s a pretty good value at this price point.  </li>
<li> If you shave with a brush, good shaving cream or soap (NOT FOAM OR GEL FROM A CAN, but something from a tube or tub, of which there are numerous options), and a good blade (honestly, old-school double-edged safety razors are far superior to so-called \\&quot;modern\\&quot; cartridge razors), and if you use skin food afterward, you&#x27;ll get the best shave possible.  </li>
<li> My wife even commented that it was pretty good.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s mellow, classic and something very nice to smell.</li>
<li> Awesome classic barber scent and very soothing!</li>
<li> This delightful concoction is to shaving as a fine vintage Cabernet is to French cuisine.</li>
<li> Its unique and imported!</li>
<li> He smiled a confident smile.</li>
<li> love this stuff easy on my face</li>
<li> It&#x27;s OK, but way too strong.</li>
<li> Go easy to prevent sexual harassment lawsuits.  </li>
<li> It has a nice, bracing, mildly astringent feel when applied after a shave.</li>
<li> Not overpowering, just a nice scent and feels great after a double edge shave.</li>
<li> Drop a couple ounces of your favorite cologne in equally cheap bottle and it may be better.</li>
<li> I love the smell, more importantly, my girlfriend LOVES it too.  </li>
<li> Old school scent, works great, I love it.</li>
<li> love the smell, masculine scent smells like a barbershop, great product, fast shipping, good price</li>
<li> It is inexpensive but has a good scent that holds up well, is not overpowering, and makes you smell fresh and clean.  </li>
<li> Smells very good, and does last a while.</li>
<li> Very good especially considering the price.&lt;br</li>
<li> Feels very cool after applying this</li>
<li> A classic is always better to go with than something that&#x27;s an overpriced &amp;#34;flavor-of-the-month.&amp;#34; This is the kind of aftershave for a gentleman who is keenly aware of his sartorial taste and wants to put his best foot forward.</li>
<li> I purchased it for my boyfriend and found it to be nothing more than a cheap smelling cologne you would buy at the grocery store.</li>
<li> This is a great old school scent.</li>
<li> Then I lightly apply some more Clubman Pinaud.</li>
<li> The scent is light and refreshing too.</li>
<li> It stings going on and makes you puff up your chest as you walk out of the bathroom smelling like the man you fantasized becoming when you were a kid.</li>
<li> If you are looking for that great old time barbershop smell, this is what you want.</li>
<li> So far it&#x27;s been working out great.  </li>
<li> This is a fantastic manly smell, that will be sure to turn heads and give any woman that hint of their father or grandfather smell.....</li>
<li> For me the burn is great even with sensitive skin.  </li>
<li> So much so that I sometimes put it on before I go to sleep just to feel good with myself.</li>
<li> If you take the top off and smell it right out of the bottle, yes, the scent is VERY strong.</li>
<li> When it first arrived, I liked the scent, but I quickly realized that it was kind of overpowering.  </li>
<li> For those who love a strong scent and aren&#x27;t deterred by alcohol based products, you&#x27;ll enjoy it.  </li>
<li> I expected it to smell too strong and pungent, but it is just perfect in every way.</li>
<li> /&gt;It has a great manly scent, and a nice feel that does not leave me feeling dry.  </li>
<li> Nice pleasant throw back smell.</li>
<li> That may not be fair but it really does smell like a strong version of Brut cologne.  </li>
<li> And given that today most men wear aftershaves with ingredients like Patchouli and Ylang Ylang, Clubman becomes a unique smell that no one will find too overpowering.</li>
<li> As other reviewers have said, this product is excellent.  </li>
<li> Not a lot of sting, the fragrance alone brought back thousands of good memories!</li>
<li> Not only is he famous, but he proudly wears 3 Wolf Moon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Others can smell it on you easily, so be cautious of the application amount.</li>
<li> A spectacular and invigorating astringent, and the smell is straight from the most luxurious barber shop you can imagine.</li>
<li> Beats out the over-priced after shaves easily.</li>
<li> price is also a great benefit over the CC Bay Rum, coming in at nearly a third of the price for 50% more product (6 oz.</li>
<li> price is also a great benefit over the CC Bay Rum, coming in at nearly a third of the price for 50% more product (6 oz.</li>
<li> you face aftershave is required to help your skin heal its self to prevent blemish i love the clean sensation (and</li>
<li> and I liked it so much I bought one for our son :-)</li>
<li> as many of the reviewers have said, it does remind me of good old barber shop and has this manly smell that I don&#x27;t get from fancy deodorants or Cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It not only feels great, but the smell is just lovely.</li>
<li> but the price made it easy to give it a try.</li>
<li> It is not always easy to find in our town</li>
<li> Holy cow this smells good!!!</li>
<li> Not too strong.  </li>
<li> This stuff is strong.</li>
<li> Smells strong tho</li>
<li> my wife complains about how strong the smell is, but after 5 mins it&#x27;s ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> wish I had known how strong it was, but that&#x27;s my fault for not reading the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I will strongly recommend for an enemy, never to a friend.</li>
<li> This is a strong smell by the way.</li>
<li> Some seem to think its quite strong in that regard</li>
<li> , I don&#x27;t, I think its moderately strong.</li>
<li> I recommend this product for anyone looking to replace strong and overpowering colognes.</li>
<li> it does smell quite strong at times, and some people might not like the scent.</li>
<li> Some reviewers here complain about the strong smell...</li>
<li> strong manly aroma.</li>
<li> The scent is noticable from close distance, but is not so strong that everyone in a 100&#x27; area of you will notice.</li>
<li> Strong smell, perhaps too strong, but it gives you that barbershop feel when you are done shaving.  </li>
<li> so it&#x27;s not so strong.</li>
<li> This is way too strong a fragrance.  </li>
<li> However, the smell is just too strong.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t find the fragnance as strong as it has been made in the reviews.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not over-powering or too strong.</li>
<li> It does contain alcohol, but it didn&#x27;t make the scent too strong.  </li>
<li> This is a good old school aftershave, reminds me of the barber shop for sure.</li>
<li> My girlfriend doesn&#x27;t like the smell because it comes off too strong.</li>
<li> /&gt;The smell is not too strong</li>
<li> I liked it very much and would recommend to anyone.</li>
<li> first I was worried that the smell would be too strong, even though I liked it a lot.</li>
<li> Best damn aftershave ever with a great masculine fragrance (not cheap smell).</li>
<li> The smell is pretty nice</li>
<li> Oh and the best part is this stuff is extremely inexpensive and widely available.</li>
<li> Its cool and refreshing and no burn.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not at all overpowering, it just has a nice, clean, fresh scent that stays throughout the day.  </li>
<li> But after about 15 minutes, it begins to drydown and settle down into a wonderful, manly, semi-refined smell that is highlighted by vanilla and the smell of babershop shaving cream.</li>
<li> Both do a great job of making my face feel soft and clean all day</li>
<li> Both do a great job of making my face feel soft and clean all day</li>
<li> I find that a trace of the scent lingers into the evening (which is fine with me as I don&#x27;t wear cologne).</li>
<li> I prefer Captain&#x27;s Choice aftershaves or Fine aftershaves.</li>
<li> This fine barber shop after shave has been used since Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday, soldiers in the Civil War throughout history up to the Titanic to the Queen Mary to today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Of course you have, or you wouldn&#x27;t be looking to purchase a fine product like this.  </li>
<li> product works fine as an aftershave if you like alcohol.  </li>
<li> Rest of the stars go for the fragrance and the cool refreshing feeling it gives after a baby smooth shave.</li>
<li> This is a fantastic scent, I&#x27;ve heard some say it&#x27;s too strong and to cut it with witch hazel.</li>
<li> So for $6 for around 6 oz you have a great, classic, distinctive scent, and a good quality aftershave that can double as your cologne.</li>
<li> It gives you a unique classic smell that isn&#x27;t over powering and doesn&#x27;t linger like some after shaves do, you still smell good</li>
<li> I think these are pretty good adjectives, and quite a bit more effectively descriptive than the analogy which I was trying to form, which involved Errol Flynn&#x27;s armpits, the tropics, and French royalty.&lt;br</li>
<li> At first was not to impressed,  I mean smells good, but how to impress the ladies smelling like my dad?</li>
<li> The scent is amazing and it truly reminds me of an old barber shop, as many have said.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s cheap; it smells like cheap; and it smells STRONGLY of cheap.  </li>
<li> The barber always ended his shave with a huge dose of Pinaud Clubman from the industrial size bottle on the counter.</li>
<li> Very powdery smell not over powering thats kind of addicting.</li>
<li> Fortunately i like it.</li>
<li> It also makes me skin feel smooth and powdery.</li>
<li> and I enjoy the retro scent.</li>
<li> /&gt;Ok, overall a great aftershave.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a light scent that stays with you for a while.  </li>
<li> Another fabulous product from Clubman Pinaud.</li>
<li> A citrusy, musky, almost cheap smelling juice.</li>
<li> That may sound initially cheap, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
<li> and you will have a fantastic experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Cheap, tames razor burn, fades to a powdery fragrances.</li>
<li> Overall this is a great after shave works well on skin and helping with after burn and cuts.</li>
<li> , it is cheap insofar as cost</li>
<li> Kicks like cheap whiskey though.</li>
<li> ( it won&#x27;t suffocate people in an elevator like some designer colognes do) but does leave a gentle scent that is noticed...and always liked.</li>
<li> What I do know is that I enjoy it, and</li>
<li> It&#x27;s like any cheap after shave like lectric or aqua velvet...</li>
<li> cheap</li>
<li> , it is a terrific astringent leaving my face feeling  great after a close shave.</li>
<li> Inexpensive but does not smell cheap.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried during my, somewhat, advanced age.</li>
<li> He liked it so much and wanted to get one.</li>
<li> Then light up a cigar...</li>
<li> The product coming in a plastic bottle makes it feel cheap too.</li>
<li> But one day after work she hugged me and smelled the aftershave and said aloud how much she liked it.  </li>
<li> great fragrance, this will be my second bottle, I use this as aftershave and to freshen up in the morning</li>
<li> I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and will definitely continue to use it after shaving.</li>
<li> It smells fantastic, even to my girlfriend, and it helps my hair grow in faster and fuller.</li>
<li> This stuff is fantastic.</li>
<li> And the smell is great, brings back memories of watching my grandpa shave.</li>
<li> This is fantastic.</li>
<li> Leaves your face feeling smooth and soothed.  </li>
<li> It leaves you smelling great and feeling refreshed, especially after using a DE razor!</li>
<li> /&gt;You&#x27;ll really enjoy using this because of the &amp;#34;just came from the barbershop&amp;#34</li>
<li> Pinaud smells great and is a throw back to an era when daper was standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Smells fantastic just like going to the barber vetting a shave and a haircut.</li>
<li> Fantastic smell.</li>
<li> /&gt;Cannot believe such a great scent exists at this price.&lt;br</li>
<li> worries if you don&#x27;t have to shave, a light splash and people will think you did.</li>
<li> The alcohol is a bit harsh on my face, but to use every once in a while is perfect for me.</li>
<li> I like the smell, and it makes you comfortable after shaving.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s still the same if you have ever experienced it.</li>
<li> Smells and feels fantastic.</li>
<li> There are tons of aftershaves available.</li>
<li> This, along with the Proraso (100mil green bottle) after shave lotion are two that seem to be universally wonderful and proved</li>
<li> There&#x27;s a reason why its so cheap.  </li>
<li> But its cheap and practically a rite of passage for every man.</li>
<li> Great scent as well which seems to carry over to the following day.</li>
<li> It will bring back a lot of great barbershop memories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> If you like Brut or dont know what Brut smells like, you might enjoy this product.  </li>
<li> So when I needed to add something to my order for free shipping, I bit the bullet.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
<li> I think it&#x27;s fantastic for the price.</li>
<li> Manly shaving smell, smooth and soothing.</li>
<li> great aftershave at a ridiculously low price</li>
<li> Good old style after shave.</li>
<li> Smells like the good old fashioned type manly smell  from the corner barbershop.  </li>
<li> Men&#x27;s health did a puff piece on the good old days and the barber shops of my youth.  </li>
<li> Reminds me of the good old days.</li>
<li> Best comparison would be to talcum powder smell, like you left straight from the barber shop.</li>
<li> Does a good job, even on my sensitive skin.</li>
<li> Fades away quickly enough to not offend anyone without the good taste to love it.</li>
<li> The Scent is really good and &#x27;CLASSY&#x27;</li>
<li> I am 31 and was worried about smelling like an old man, but tonight I went out with some friends and one of my friends who is a girl complimented me on how good I smell</li>
<li> If you loved the smell of aftershave in an old time barber shop; this is it.</li>
<li> I received this product on time, and I started using them already, so far so good.</li>
<li> It dries to a very \\&quot;powdery\\&quot; scent, which is OK but not my favorite thing.  </li>
<li> A great, clean, lasting scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It&#x27;s pleasant, but not overly strong, and in the proper context I do recommend it.</li>
<li> The fragrance is strong when you put it on but quickly fades (i&#x27;ve found others can smell it within around 30 minutes of putting it on).</li>
<li> It no longer has that super strong alcohol smell.</li>
<li> Had to give this one 4 stars though because I like the classic vanilla much more than the original.!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve smelt it and it smells very fresh and clean.</li>
<li> THIS AFTERSHAVE IS GREAT, LASTS A LONG TIME, EVEN IF I START TO SWEAT MY FACE</li>
<li> Success!</li>
<li> so i went with something original</li>
<li> Well worth it!</li>
<li> I can recall this familiar smell in barber shops when i was a kid.</li>
<li> I would say that this is a sure shot with the ladies, otherwise we wouldn&#x27;t be here today ;)</li>
<li> With that strategy, and by shaving in the shower with lots of hot water, I can get a shave that is even better than a barbershop straight-razor shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Not much more to say that hasn&#x27;t already been said about this awesome aftershave.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m pretty sure that this also clogs up nicks and dings I tend to make when I cut myself shaving.</li>
<li> and they laugh !</li>
<li> This is my every day scent, unique, manly, it smells like nothing else.</li>
<li> That familiar smell of the barber&#x27;s powder?</li>
<li> I wasn&#x27;t sure at first about this stuff.  </li>
<li> It was a very pleasing smell, though do watch out because it is strong!</li>
<li> Very good clean smell, gotten numerous comments on how good it smells from people both the ladies and other men wondering where to get it.</li>
<li> A clean feel on the face and a confidence in your step.</li>
<li> It is a clean scent with no musk or flowers or citrus.</li>
<li> It wakes me up and keeps me feeling clean.</li>
<li> Its mellow, clean, and wears off well.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a clean manly smell.</li>
<li> If you like barber shops and a clean smell you will like this.</li>
<li> &amp; he just smells clean and manly.  </li>
<li> Clean.</li>
<li> This mix has been the same and perfect since I was a brat in the 60s - 70s.&lt;br /&gt;Loved it as young shaver, still do at 50 years of age this year.&lt;br</li>
<li> squirt a bit of clubman on my electric razor head once in awhile to clean it off.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a clean, &amp;#34;just&amp;#34</li>
<li> Smells intrigingly different and pleasant.</li>
<li> I shave my head and neck with a straight razor and a good splashing of this will leave you ready for the day.  </li>
<li> Nice smell, very masculine.</li>
<li> Great scent, seals up minor cuts quickly.</li>
<li> not too strong, just right.</li>
<li> Has a nice light fragrance, dies away quickly and won&#x27;t complete if you plan to wear cologne afterward.</li>
<li> I switch off between this and the special reserve.</li>
<li> I Use/Prefer Clubman Special Reserve</li>
<li> /&gt;ladies, do yourself a favor and buy this for that special man.</li>
<li> The smell is OK and it is very strong and it lasts several hours.  </li>
<li> Smells ok, just cheap and sweet, but I gave it to my little brother and he was pretty happy.</li>
<li> Great smell, works as expected to ease irritation and cool the skin.  </li>
<li> It also does a pretty good job as far as stopping razor burn and cleaning out any cuts.</li>
<li> Instead i would like to smell like a true man, like i remember my grandfather smelling.</li>
<li> A full whiff of this will take your breath away.</li>
<li> I did like the smell, and the cool bottle.</li>
<li> It has a nice masculine scent</li>
<li> Picked this stuff up at Walgreen&#x27;s since I heard such good things.</li>
<li> I love shaving now because I splash this stuff on my face and ready to face the day.</li>
<li> I really did hope to like the stuff because of the price and history…but even that couldn&#x27;t persuade me to use it one more time.  </li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;d also like to point ouy in my honest opinion this item is only receiving reviews based on nostalgia reasons and not because it&#x27;s an actual great product.</li>
<li> Ditch the sweet, feminine colognes, lotions, and aftershave gels.  </li>
<li> More specifically, I can smell citrus oil (not so much lemon blossom or orange oil as citronella), and J&amp;J baby powder, plus there&#x27;s also a &amp;#34;bass</li>
<li> This stuff is a true bargain</li>
<li> It is unmistakably masculine and has a distinctive scent of its own.</li>
<li> This is not the &#x27;modern&#x27; scent which many times cannot be distinguished as either men&#x27;s cologne or women&#x27;s perfume.</li>
<li> Not only does the product do what its supposed to do it also comes at a fair price.</li>
<li> Works as advertised, smells good and instantly takes away any stinging after shaving the head!!!</li>
<li> Good size, will definitely last a while</li>
<li> /&gt;Gives pinch for a second then feels good.</li>
<li> Overall, this is a really good product.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s nice to smell like a man and not a twelve year old boy.  </li>
<li> The scent is enjoyable, but doesn&#x27;t linger too much after applied</li>
<li> It also is very soothing and refreshing after a shave.</li>
<li> Just as my title states, this is a true manly scent.</li>
<li> This is how my grandfather used to smell and this aftershave brought back some good memories of my childhood.</li>
<li> A bit too sweet.</li>
<li> It has a nice old scent but</li>
<li> It does a marginal job of relieving razor burn, which is its basic function, but nothing else about it is any good.</li>
<li> preference is Pinaud Clubman because I like a cool feeling on my face after a shave.</li>
<li> It does burn but it&#x27;s not too much -- it does make it feel more &amp;#34;machos&amp;#34; in a way...</li>
<li> Although I don&#x27;t have anything against Old Spice (it kind of reminds me of my dad)</li>
<li> that is cool again now a days.</li>
<li> This product has shown me what true men smell like.</li>
<li> I can see how they recently celebrated 200 years of business.</li>
<li> I was really surprised how much I liked it.  </li>
<li> Too sweet and flowery for me.</li>
<li> They are all true though.  </li>
<li> Not bad.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s not a bad aftershave, it does what it is meant to.&lt;br /&gt;THIS WILL WAKE YOU UP WITH THE BURNING ALCOHOL FEEL OF A THOUSAND DEMONS.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> IMO that&#x27;s not a bad thing.</li>
<li> For that price is not bad at all .Is</li>
<li> I got it because the reviews said it was not only cheap but also smells really good, which is true in both cases, my friends always tell me that I smell really good all day long when I use it!</li>
<li> I love both the original Clubman Pinaud and Classic Vanilla scent.</li>
<li> My favorite alcohol based splash on with a strong masculine scent.  </li>
<li> Clubman has a nice mild scent-like Canoe, and my daughters frequently mention that they like the fragrance when I give them a hug.  </li>
<li> A great, nostalgic scent and a pleasant sting as it tightens up your skin.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a clear, strong \\&quot;cologney\\&quot; scent that lingers with you (or anyone who gets within an inch of your face) for most of the day - just as it should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It does have a very strong barber shop smell which I like but not everyday!</li>
<li> I mean if you want to be the best smelling man in town</li>
<li> it&#x27;s classic many, though not harsh, smell is quite nice.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s pretty strong.</li>
<li> Strong at first but mellows out after a bit.</li>
<li> It harkens back to the era of real barber shops, not &amp;#34;styling salons.&amp;#34; It is a classic, manly, wonderful scent.</li>
<li> Strong at first.</li>
<li> Works well as an after shave and has a pretty strong scent for an aftershave.  </li>
<li> The vanilla scent is also very nice... does not really smell of vanilla at all.</li>
<li> /&gt;it is a classic aftershave that is cool and refreshing would recommend</li>
<li> After the first splash on my mug, my eyes burned a little bit and the scent hit me like a truck, a very pleasant, manly truck.</li>
<li> On me personally, its excellent (my skin is pretty sensitive but also a bit oily</li>
<li> others all have alcohol and give you that familiar cooling, fresh, astringent sensation.</li>
<li> Other than that, this product is great and I will purchase this again.</li>
<li> Once the slight sting subsides, it leaves my skin feeling very good (better than a lot of inexpensive aftershaves like Brut or Aqua Velva, specifically this leaves my skin soft and moist without feeling sticky), so I&#x27;m a fan in that regard.</li>
<li> Fresh and clean.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s fresh and clean, and doesn&#x27;t cost $40 and up.</li>
<li> It is fresh, clean, sort of powdery smell.  </li>
<li> the fresh, clean, powdery scent.  </li>
<li> it has a clean and fresh smell.</li>
<li> I myself love classic barber shop scents.</li>
<li> I appreciate the smaller opening at the top so it does not dispense more than needed.</li>
<li> Classic scent that I personally love (age 24).</li>
<li> and I think it is mild.</li>
<li> You know that it&#x27;s doing what it&#x27;s supposed to, and any razor burn you had will quickly be gone.</li>
<li> but as the day wears on and actually, when I get a bit sweaty, believe it or not, it smells even more sexy.</li>
<li> And then there&#x27;s that famous scent, which brings me back to my childhood trips to the barbershop but never smells &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;- just refreshing.</li>
<li> if not you may want to try Lucky Tiger brand.</li>
<li> went out that night to celebrate, and the Most Interesting Man in the world was in the corner table of the local bar.  </li>
<li> Confident, clear and comfortable.  </li>
<li> Just A Quick Note:  I</li>
<li> This is classic slash on shave lotion - I love the aroma.</li>
<li> The purpose of an aftershave seems two-fold, one as a mild astringent and two for the aroma.</li>
<li> B0017WNSBS Lucky Tiger</li>
<li> I personally love the classic Clubman fragrance.</li>
<li> Those of us who enjoyed a cool buzz cut or a flat top will appreciate this after shave lotion.  </li>
<li> But I stuck with it and that scent-memory has now been replaced with my own new (happily married with kids) scent-memory.  </li>
<li> After Shave is pleasant in smell, but I must watch how much I use - can be overbearing if you are not careful.  </li>
<li> This magical liquid, used right after the shave, would instantly relief the burning sensation (or prevent it from even taking place), and honestly it&#x27;s doing exactly what I bought it for.</li>
<li> This stuff comes in a plastic bottle (darn, looked more epic online), but is the original Clubman scent....</li>
<li> so I grabbed the first thing I saw on the shelf because it was cheap and there was lots of it in the bottle.</li>
<li> It has such a classic scent and it feel great on my face.  </li>
<li> A classic men&#x27;s scent, splash some on when you want to feel like you just got out from your barber&#x27;s shop and want to tackle the world-very old school in a good way.</li>
<li> My skin is rather sensitive and, in spite of the &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; this has on my freshly shaven face, it soothes my sensitive skin very nicely.</li>
<li> Thus began my new love affair.</li>
<li> Been using this product for more than 50 years tried all the new ones.</li>
<li> I still love my stetson, brut, skin bracer and aqua velva but wanted to try something new.  </li>
<li> The bottle will last you a pretty good while.</li>
<li> Ever since I was a kid my barber would dust behind my ears and neck after my cut with a sweet smelling talc that was absolutely delicious.  </li>
<li> My wife loves the scent, I love the cool old school bottle.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve even had young guys ask what I&#x27;m wearing because that liked it and were interested in purchasing it for themselves.</li>
<li> Very Old school and confident smell.</li>
<li> Even though I haven&#x27;t thought about it in so many years, it&#x27;s still vivid in my memory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I love this stuff and it reminds of getting haircuts when I was a young teenager, all barbers in Brooklyn NY kept this stuff on hand at all times!</li>
<li> but it has a very unique smell and the bottle seemed kind of small and cheap.  </li>
<li> I thought it smelled manly, clean and helped the sting and bleeding after shaving pretty well...</li>
<li> Another great feature, initially it might be a bit strong but very shortly after using, it fades.</li>
<li> Their Bay Rum is great and there are still lots of other scents in their lineup I&#x27;d be willing to sample.</li>
<li> When you line up someone or Razor them up just finish the of with some after shave and it&#x27;ll give the a little sting with a great smell</li>
<li> much can be overwhelming, so be smart about it, but it is a timeless</li>
<li> I personally don&#x27;t find the smell overpowering like some have mentioned, but rather the right balance between being able to give off a nice smell that isn&#x27;t too strong, and at the same time doesn&#x27;t vanish as the day goes by.  </li>
<li> I enjoy the smell so much that I&#x27;m now shaving every 2-3 days.</li>
<li> I gave it 3 stars for fast shipping and smooth transaction.</li>
<li> When it arrived I immediately had to try it, which was fun since it was about</li>
<li> and overall I really liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Great old time barbershop smell, reminds me of my dad&#x27;s WW2 generation who went on to work office jobs after the war but still smelled manly, not effeminate like subsequent generations.</li>
<li> It just has a fresh sort of feel.  </li>
<li> I love this old school aftershave...</li>
<li> It is a fresh powdery scent.</li>
<li> I say this because there are far better products out there for post shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Worth every cent</li>
<li> But take it for what its worth.</li>
<li> Pick up your ax, eat your steak rare, and smell like a man.</li>
<li> and I also love the fact that its readily available in any drug store or supermarket, which made it my personal go-to for a while.</li>
<li> I never would have guessed it was even worth mentioning.</li>
<li> I never would have guessed it was even worth mentioning.</li>
<li> It smells nice and it&#x27;s inexpensive, but I definitely can&#x27;t use it.</li>
<li> It does smell that fresh.</li>
<li> If you are getting into old school shaving you can confidently buy a bottle of this and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
<li> If you want something that reminds you of how men smelled fresh from a barbershop-</li>
<li> definitely like it, but the real judge of whether this is any good is the lady in your life.  </li>
<li> Most men know the sandalwood-like smell from the Pinaud talc they still use in old fashioned barber shops.</li>
<li> So much so I decided to give more of their products a sample since they are very affordable.</li>
<li> By the time the package was opened all of the after shave lotion had been evaporated or absorbed into the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Go get a bottle guys you will love the old barber shop smell.</li>
<li> And then a handsome young snowboarder (dichotomy #1) asked to share our chair, and as luck would have it, it was he who smelled so divine (dichotomy #2)</li>
<li> Yours will too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean and fresh..</li>
<li> The minute I put it on a get an exciting tingle all over my body</li>
<li> This is a nice, classically manly-smelling aftershave.  </li>
<li> It smells very similar to, and nicely complements, the Clubman Pinaud talc.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s fun, it will make you smell like Grandpa.</li>
<li> My Father and Myself love this old fashioned lotion.  </li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t used this, I gave it to my boyfriend as a gift, he said he likes it, and I just love them smell so classy</li>
<li> Ofcourse, smell is objective, but most people I know enjoy the smell</li>
<li> It has a fresh crips smell to it.</li>
<li> This stuff goes on great and leaves my face feeling completely refreshed after my daily DE shave.</li>
<li> Worth every penny.</li>
<li> and I had to laugh.</li>
<li> that fresh haircut and a shave feeling is reborn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It really is old school, my wife and kids love it</li>
<li> The fragrance is strong but decent.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s own or in conjunction with multiple products.</li>
<li> Just for fun I bought a sample of this from Garry&#x27;s sample shop.  </li>
<li> I have been looking for different shaving lotions to give some kind of variety.  </li>
<li> Worth a try for $6.</li>
<li> I and a lot of college kids discovered Clubman aftershave in the 60s as an economical alternative to Canoe.</li>
<li> It does not smell fresh at all.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a nice scent and has a better lasting power than most other aftershave lotions that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> If you are a gentleman that is worthy of a top hat and cane, if you can hold a monocle in wilst bare knuckle boxing a lion, then this is for you.</li>
<li> men know that slapping alcohol right on your freshly shaved skin is what you are suppose to do, none of that moisturizing stuff here</li>
<li> to the actual product being reviewed, though--if your skin isn&#x27;t significantly irritated, or if you&#x27;re really going to use aftershave as a cologne, not applying it right after shaving, this is a nice option.  </li>
<li> Love this product, smells fresh and clean, my husband had actually bought it</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a cheap aftershave that smells like original Old Spice to me.</li>
<li> In the seventies, I tried my first &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; colognes and found that for an extraordinary price, I could wear a fragrance that made me smell somewhere between a man and a woman.  </li>
<li> My only concern is that it has a strong scent and can be easily over applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
<li> I have been testing out different after shave rubs for a couple for months now, and I have really enjoyed the invigorating feel of the Clubman Pinaud after a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> guess the true test was asking my wife for her opinion and it was a positive one.  </li>
<li> I was truly excited while shaving this morning, ready to try this on.</li>
<li> But if you&#x27;ve ever had a haircut in a real barbershop, chance are you are already familiar with Clubman.</li>
<li> i think it carries the right amount of musk.</li>
<li> I would never want to wear this right before work since some people may complain.</li>
<li> Just the right amount of sting after shaving my face and my head.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;ve earned my right to wear Clubman Pinaud</li>
<li> its just right .  </li>
<li> The price is right so give it a go.</li>
<li> (after it has settled for about 30 minutes; if she smells the CC right after application, she hates it).  </li>
<li> /&gt;Applying a nickel-sized puddle of this to the face is the right way to start any day, even if you don&#x27;t shave that day.</li>
<li> The price was right.</li>
<li> Yes, right after I splash on some Clinique For Men Oil Control Exfoliating Tonic.  </li>
<li> ,thats right and all the girls at work still come up to me and say &amp;</li>
<li> I tried this based on many positive reviews and found that my wife thinks it is as good an aroma as the more expensive Drakkar.  </li>
<li> It leaves a very masculine classy scent and the chicks love it!</li>
<li> But the Geo Trumper Coral skin food is what I will most likely use, long term, because of its light scent and cool refreshing feel.</li>
<li> It can be pretty powerful when first applied but backs off quickly.</li>
<li> am pretty sure this is going to attract 50 year old women with daddy issues</li>
<li> This stuff has a really great old fashioned smell that lasts all day long.  </li>
<li> However old this magic juice is, the smell is still very pleasing, masculine, and refreshing.</li>
<li> nothing less  Perfect for daily use.</li>
<li> This, combined with the &#x27;66 super speed I gave him, brings back many memories for him.</li>
<li> I like this more than Old Spice and this price is better than my local CVS!</li>
<li> I realized, however, that I&#x27;d never even TRIED an alcohol-based aftershave, and that, in our modern, free world, a man is able to order things such as this on Amazon, just to see how they work.</li>
<li> Great spicy, alcoholic scent that feels vintage.</li>
<li> It gives that nice burn when I use it and the scent doesn&#x27;t linger too long.  </li>
<li> Momentarily burns your skin before soothing and giving off a nice smell that doesn&#x27;t linger too long.</li>
<li> And it would be hard to top the clean scent &amp; refreshing feeling of Clubman Pinaud.</li>
<li> but I will go back to my good old &amp;#34;skin bracer&amp;#34;</li>
<li> far as the smell goes, I did not find it to be too strong.  </li>
<li> I never disliked the scent but it took a day or two for me to really get used to it, and really love it.</li>
<li> So, I discovered that the scent of the Clubman after shave is noticeably different and less pleasant when the bottle has been sitting for a while, so make sure to shake it before each use.  </li>
<li> Later that night at the grocery store, the cashier gave me my groceries for free, and the manager gave me a lifetime of free groceries of I</li>
<li> Nothing makes you feel more like a man than carving up your face with an old fashioned straight razor just before applying this virtual fire to your face.  </li>
<li> I personally LOVE the scent and find it does not dry out my skin.  </li>
<li> Growing up, and getting my hair cut at the old local barber shop, I always loved the distinctive &amp;#34;old barber shop&amp;#34; smell.</li>
<li> A bit strong for those with sensitive skin.</li>
<li> After five or six hours it will fade to the sort of fragrance that Pinaud puts in its talc, but before that there&#x27;s a complex medley of soft, smooth, and very pleasant aromas that smell natural and masculine, but in a gentlemanly sort of way--it&#x27;s intended more for going to the opera than going out to the woods to hunt grizzly bears.</li>
<li> By the time you&#x27;re done getting ready, have out this on, and have gone out for the day; it will have the perfect light, distinct, classic, full-bodied, aroma that sets you apart from every other person that girl has been around that day</li>
<li> Now the regular scent which we are talking about here is more balanced and better used in those touchy &#x27;Social Situations!&#x27;</li>
<li> Very much of the less-is-more era.</li>
<li> I very much like this scent.</li>
<li> Very reasonably prices, seven dollars for six ounces.</li>
<li> Price is very reasonable for the size of the bottle and the quality of it.</li>
<li> it is very reasonably priced.</li>
<li> Very reasonably priced.</li>
<li> Classic with a little sting, great end to a shave.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve worn Old Spice Fresh for years, and now I have a new favorite.</li>
<li> This is a traditional, authentic, barbershop product with a pleasant, masculine scent that stays long after application.</li>
<li> So if you&#x27;re most concerned about keeping your face smooth and soft over the long run, you might prefer Lucky</li>
<li> Will buy the larger bottle next time with free shipping for a better deal!</li>
<li> Good but little pricecee for the size</li>
<li> Classic, cool, crisp scent.</li>
<li> The alcohol content is very high, and just by smelling it you can tell how powerful it is.</li>
<li> As an eighteen year old in high school i smell lots kids wearing Axe&#x27;s latest aerosol \\&quot;cologne\\&quot;.</li>
<li> Pretty manly stuff here</li>
<li> It thought it was the moment that I got my first car or after my first time I was with a woman.</li>
<li> It was the first time I slapped this stuff on my face.</li>
<li> I have been using this for several yearrs and love it.  </li>
<li> From my husband - at first he was reluctant to try to an &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; aftershave that came in a plastic bottle....turned out to be his favorite....much nicer scent and easier on sink than Hugo Boss, Pack Rabanne Million etc.</li>
<li> I first heard about it from the Art of Manliness blog and decided to check it out.</li>
<li> Tried this for the first time...</li>
<li> I had not really heard of Clubman until I had to order my father some of their hair gel here on Amazon and tried a container of it and liked it myself.  </li>
<li> The crowning jewel of a rewarding classical shave.</li>
<li> I tried it for the first time.</li>
<li> Lovely earthy tones mixed with a barber shop scent.  </li>
<li> After Shave Lotion, and some you better grow a pair and start acting like you do, too.</li>
<li> For the first couple days I knew a</li>
<li> I&#x27;m gladly going back to my Proraso.  </li>
<li> This will bring you back to the days when you walked out of the barber shop feeling like you were on top of the world after paying two bits for a shave and a haircut.</li>
<li> First I&#x27;d like to say this product is NOT a lotion as labeled on bottle and description.</li>
<li> I am pretty sure they put some sort of inhale-able addictive substance in this product.</li>
<li> I can gladly give this product a solid five stars!</li>
<li> Possibly the most manliest of manly aftershave</li>
<li> Every time I take a whiff it takes me back to the days of five dollar haircuts :)</li>
<li> but I decided to buy some when I bought my first double-edge razor.</li>
<li> It was pretty surreal.</li>
<li> When I wear it, as I do and have regularly, I get many compliments from the female persuasion on its appealing scent.</li>
<li> In the 1960s, when I first started shaving, I used my Dad&#x27;s after shaves...</li>
<li> you are not for the most recent then you will like this</li>
<li> I love this Clubman Pinuad scent takes me back to the days when the barber would sit me up into the booster seat in his chair.</li>
<li> It is not expensive item</li>
<li> ;)</li>
<li> Also, it is a perfectly logical companion to the Arko shave soap in my kit.</li>
<li> Many people like and dislike this product for the same reason.</li>
<li> totally reminds me of my barber shop and gives that manly scent I love about going to a &amp;#34;barber shop&amp;#34;.</li>
<li> One of my favorite parts of going to the barber shop is when, at the end, the barber sprinkles Clubman talcum powder on the back of my neck.</li>
<li> but when I finally finish it I will order more.</li>
<li> I wish there was a way to sample the scents before buying, but Clubman is more likely to be sold in a pharmacy than a fancy department store where there is a girl at the perfume counter waiting to let you sample everything under the sun.</li>
<li> First off, if you are a member of the metro-sexual, Axe spraying, Justin Bieber listening boys club move along.</li>
<li> You need a current man card to appreciate the simplicity of it, yet need to be able to distinguish between the complexity of what it means to use a man&#x27;s man&#x27;s product and the responsibility in doing so.</li>
<li> Sure, I don&#x27;t smell like a male model, but I don&#x27;t want to smell like desperation.</li>
<li> Just this morning I used Clubman for the first time ever.</li>
<li> I bought this for my dad for father&#x27;s day and he really likes it!</li>
<li> It does exactly what you expect in an aftershave.</li>
<li> they&#x27;re typically interested in smelling you.</li>
<li> It smells almost exactly like a barber shop.&lt;br</li>
<li> \\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at my husband, sitting safely unmolested on my left.</li>
<li> I am the first one chosen.</li>
<li> Thanks Clubman!</li>
<li> My favorite is George F. Trumper brand \\&quot;skin food\\&quot; (especially this one:</li>
<li> Yeah this is going to smell exactly as you imagine it will.</li>
<li> You may even wear it out, assuming you&#x27;re either a married man or out with your pals on a bowling night.</li>
<li> They were kinda hot though.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll be getting more when my current bottle runs out.</li>
<li> I never fail to get compliments when I wear Clubman.</li>
<li> I was able to find it at my local cvs.</li>
<li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this.</li>
<li> Overall, they are all excellent, however, they are naturally different in various ways, so one&#x27;s taste may cause a preference for one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> First time I used it, she came home afterwork and just said &amp;#34;WOW</li>
<li> Would highly recommend!!</li>
<li> The bottle stipulates that it is the same formula from a more civilized time, however the scent doesn&#x27;t remind me of my grandfather as old spice does.  </li>
<li> I think it&#x27;s pretty</li>
<li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
<li> THANKS CLUBMAN!</li>
<li> 4 stars, not 5 - I only 5 for truly outstanding products.  </li>
<li> For wet shavers, this pairs beautifully with the talcum powder under the same label.</li>
<li> As many have written, this is a very traditional barber shop like scent.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried many different after shaves.</li>
<li> Great, long lasting smell.</li>
<li> Wakes you up in the morning, and leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
<li> with that said, I remember when I first used it.  </li>
<li> this stuff smells great and smell is long lasting.</li>
<li> Though I would expect it be in a better packaging which will only add to its value.</li>
<li> Years later, I discovered that the scent that triggered so many fond memories was this after shave.</li>
<li> Since I started using Clubman, I have received many compliments, especially from the ladies.</li>
<li> but it also has this crisp manly scent to it.</li>
<li> don&#x27;t judge a book bye its cover its not expensive</li>
<li> Good value for everyday wear.</li>
<li> Nice classic smell, a bit strong for me but wiping with my damp towel brings it down to a reasonable level, for me anyway.</li>
<li> High quality product worthy of 5 stars</li>
<li> /&gt;And if you live in a warm climate, try their talk on a traditional horsehair neck duster in the summer.</li>
<li> This is alcohol based, so it&#x27;s not super pleasant on nics and cuts, but it works great in conjunction with some cold water to close up pores, kill bacteria, and keep the face feeling fresh and clean all day.</li>
<li> I (as well and my gf) prefer Brut because it&#x27;s a little more manly, though both are cheap.</li>
<li> Now, it definitely is old school, it will make you think of what the original barber shops would use.  </li>
<li> Clubman Pinaud is the real deal and comes complete with memories of smoke filled upstairs barbershop, wrinkled leather chairs and barber honing a keen edge on his leather strop.  </li>
<li> came across this after shave after comparing prices with the art of shaving products which In fact are great products but ridiculously over priced.</li>
<li> This stuff is powerful, inexpensive, and packs a classic barbershop scent.</li>
<li> Classic, well groomed, fresh from the barbershop scent.  </li>
<li> I use an electric razor and while it rarely nicks or cuts, the slight tingle and smell bring back some great memories.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll still use it from time to time but be aware that this is a very classic musky smelling aftershave.</li>
<li> If you like the masculine scent of an old time barber shop then you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
<li> Pair it with Tailor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood shaving soap and go ahead and find a nice big stick to fight off all those ladies with.</li>
<li> I was looking for a good masculine scent that also provided relief from razor nicks/burn as well as closed your pores.</li>
<li> Goes on strong, but settles into a nice, subtle scent after a hour or so.</li>
<li> The light, masculine scent really did remind me of a barbershop.</li>
<li> so Soft is also kind of similar.</li>
<li> B001711FMI Clubman Jeris Osage Rub, 14 Fluid Ounce]], which probably produces the most intense cooling sensation you can get without placing your face into ice</li>
<li> That can be a good thing if you need to be low key, but no one will smell it unless they, ummmm, lick you.</li>
<li> But it does smell like old rusted hotel on top of mountain where old people come for vacations with cane holding in their hand to walk.</li>
<li> My skin is sensitive and this worked ok but didn&#x27;t wow me.</li>
<li> I guess granpa was pretty smart after all.&lt;br</li>
<li> Guys with acne, I strongly suggest this to you, the scennt is lasting and very fresh, a typial vanilla spice old barber stuff</li>
<li> It shipped fast in early in the product smells great even if you don&#x27;t shave every day just a little splash in the morning before to work</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve received nothing but positive feedback since I started using it.</li>
<li> It would behoove you to believe the rest of the reviews, the positive ones that is.</li>
<li> It has a positive effect on my skin after shaving.  </li>
<li> After reading all of the positive reviews I needed to give Clubman Pinaud aftershave a try.  </li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t dry the skin, and feels very smooth after.</li>
<li> A classic, clean, masculine scent, this aftershave leaves my face feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
<li> Actually look forward to using this stuff after a shave, clean and crisp!</li>
<li> It took about 24 hours for me to really figure out why my sense memory was nagging at me ever since I first put this on.  </li>
<li> This is dead cheap and you&#x27;d spend four times as much to find better in a compounded cologne.</li>
<li> It can pretty much be used as a deodorant/cologne as well.</li>
<li> Unlike everyone else on here, my first reaction wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;I feel like a real man\\&quot;</li>
<li> Tried a few and very satisfied.</li>
<li> Maybe it will be good for every once and a while, but still not sure yet.</li>
<li> The good news is that a bottle will usually run you between 3 and 5 bucks so</li>
<li> That being said, once the 15 second pain-cycle has ended, your face will feel clean and fresh.  </li>
<li> There are a lot of humorous reviews of this aftershave, but this one is going to be more serious.</li>
<li> The great thing about Clubman it is incredibly subtle, but very longlasting.</li>
<li> Call me old school, but I enjoy the classic scent.</li>
<li> this is really barbershop perfume and it leaves the skin clean and soft.</li>
<li> last a long time, reminds me of barbershop, others think the smell is too strong, but i love it.</li>
<li> I have used so many high priced after shave lotions and this one simply beats all off them on price and quality front.&lt;br</li>
<li> It give a person a sense of a fresh new haircut after having one.</li>
<li> Very classic smell.</li>
<li> and it is a very classic barbershop scent</li>
<li> This lotion always leaves me feeling super soft.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a very classic scent.</li>
<li> This stuff has that same musky, strong, grandpa-in-the-barbershop smell.</li>
<li> The smell is ok, very old-school, but it lingers for an exceptionally long period of time.</li>
<li> A tip for the single guy&#x27;s, women do love this.</li>
<li> It certainly isn&#x27;t overpowering.  </li>
<li> Have you ever wondered what it would feel like to rinse your face with pure awesomeness?</li>
<li> THIS IS THE SENT OF PURE MAN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> if you are, this&#x27;ll certainly place you in the column of keeper.</li>
<li> Classic scent in a soothing aftershave for a very reasonable price.</li>
<li> It took me by surprise, I almost forced my wife to clean all the dishes and clean the house!!</li>
<li> One of my new favorites!!</li>
<li> highly recommend this product, and I can honestly say it will last up a super long time</li>
<li> This may be labeled after shave, but with a generous splash or two on the neck and shoulders, etc., it makes a fine cologne that will last all day.</li>
<li> If this is too much for you to grasp or appreciate don&#x27;t waste your time, Axe products are always looking for more weenies!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not overly &#x27;hot&#x27; from the alcohol, and does a decent job of soothing after a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Nothing beats this classic &amp; affordable scent!</li>
<li> Very highly.</li>
<li> As I recall it was a little sticky, but it smelled nice.  </li>
<li> After the first 10 seconds of burn wears off, youre left feeling refreshed and clean.</li>
<li> However, the smell is so strong that it&#x27;s just flat out overpowering, gaudy, and too flowery in my opinion.</li>
<li> Pinaud&#x27;s Special Reserve, which IMO smells even better but doesn&#x27;t last quite as long.</li>
<li> This stuff is intensely scented, so much so that my girlfriend really,</li>
<li> My Girlfriend complained that I smelled too \\&quot;sanitized\\&quot; after I shaved because I used a touch of rubbing alcohol as my aftershave - don&#x27;t judge, it&#x27;s cheap and does the job well... :)  </li>
<li> Very soothing scent and feel.</li>
<li> Smells like something a real man should smell like.</li>
<li> and I tell them straight up -</li>
<li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
<li> A real woman is attracted to the smell of a real man.</li>
<li> so I added it to the cart not expecting much.  </li>
<li> You can really feel the burn.</li>
<li> Very old-school scent.</li>
<li> But they sell something for when you absolutely must cut the heck out of your neck, or anyone elses.     </li>
<li> I began using this aftershave when I began shaving with a straight razor.  </li>
<li> THE WHOLE DAY</li>
<li> There is too much alcohol in it.</li>
<li> If you use too much</li>
<li> I started taking it in a separate ziplock but that cause too much liquid to be lost, so I&#x27;m not taking it on my trips</li>
<li> I was worried the smell would be over powering but after repeatedly asking my wife it if was too much</li>
<li> like it so much I am going to get some for my husband as well.  </li>
<li> This and Bay Rum are the REAL DEAL.</li>
<li> I really like it.  </li>
<li> Thanks Clubman.....</li>
<li> I spent $7.07 including tax, defiantly they make more than $6:00 profit.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t really compare it with anything else.</li>
<li> Thanks for the memories...</li>
<li> He says, its like real man.</li>
<li> In fact I really don&#x27;t see how anyone in their 20&#x27;s, or 30&#x27;s or even their 40&#x27;s should even be allowed to purchase this product.</li>
<li> I really like the fragrance and</li>
<li> After reading all of the reviews about how this is a real man scent, I was intrigued.</li>
<li> Folks will know that you are a real man who doesn&#x27;t go for that unisex girlie smelling cologne when they get a whiff of this.</li>
<li> Give you a real Kevin McCallister moment.</li>
<li> is a creamy after shave which I really like.</li>
<li> its likely that the formula really is around 200 years old, which means it was also probably popular with old guys when my grandfather&#x27;s grandfather was just a kid.</li>
<li> really well after I shave.</li>
<li> I shave with a straight razor.  </li>
<li> but I grew to really liking it.</li>
<li> My wife really likes as does my daughter.</li>
<li> Learned to avoid the gf after using in the morning so not as much of a problem.&lt;br</li>
<li> and I would much rather be a member of this elite club of gentlemen than to conform with the collective of boys, boy bands, and bieber freaks of the world.</li>
<li> The reviews here really compelled us to purchase here and the quality of the product seems good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> /&gt;Had to take off 1 star because the sticker on the bottle is made of that tin foil sticker crap.. lol don&#x27;t care for it but other than that its pretty good stuff!</li>
<li> This aftershave really irritated my skin.</li>
<li> This product really works.</li>
<li> The consistency (viscosity) very liquidy</li>
<li> I really like it.</li>
<li> and i decided to go for Culbman Pinaud after seeing rave reviews and reasonable price in Amazon</li>
<li> I really wish it came in a glass bottle.</li>
<li> wife really loves it too......</li>
<li> And it&#x27;s not made from bits of real panther which is always a bonus.</li>
<li> I absolutely recommend Clubmans Pinaud</li>
<li> After Shave Lotion for any guy who is ready to toss the girly-man aftershave and use something that smells like a guys aftershave should.</li>
<li> Very musk like and spicy.</li>
<li> The smell was very flowery with a bit of a baby powder smell.</li>
<li> the fragrance is notoverwhelming, yet it gives a fresh, masculine, fragrance that lasts.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s the stuff a real barber uses on you after a shave or hair cut in a barber shop that men go to.</li>
<li> VERY WELL.</li>
<li> Bought this after receiving a sample from a straight razor supplier.</li>
<li> It says it&#x27;s &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s really a splash.</li>
<li> The product works very well.</li>
<li> I would recommend this to anyone looking for an aftershave or just to rub some on when you&#x27;re ready to go out.</li>
<li> shave soap- thanks</li>
<li> This is the ultamate in manliness, this stuff has so much respect</li>
<li> It is really very pleasurable!$5 is a grat price for this.</li>
<li> Really?</li>
<li> Going to straight to the trash</li>
<li> I really like this aftershave.</li>
<li> It also works very well.</li>
<li> so much sometimes I just splash a bit on my face even when I dont shave.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27; t like the scent too much.</li>
<li> My wife really likes the smell as well.</li>
<li> Shave with a safety or straight razor.</li>
<li> I got a haircut in the booster seat and he got a haircut and straight razor shave.</li>
<li> My wife really likes it too.</li>
<li> Today I decided to grow up and get a real man&#x27;s haircut in lieu of one that requires gel.  </li>
<li> then this is no worse then what you&#x27;ve been using.</li>
<li> Sounds nuts, but we both really like the way it smells.</li>
<li> Really Like This Clubman Aftershave.  </li>
<li> Ogallala Bay rum which I really like,</li>
<li> Smell was pungent that mild.&lt;br /&gt;Didnt use it much.</li>
<li> There really isn&#x27;t much else to say, and I don&#x27;t want to take away from Dr. StrangeBrew&#x27;s thunder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> This is the genuine smell I remember from the barbershops as a kid back in the 50s when I went with my dad.</li>
<li> It is alcohol-based, so it really wakes you up after shaving.  </li>
<li> Ready for my 5 star review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Fast shipping.  </li>
<li> stuff is the real deal.</li>
<li> which is all that really matters in an aftershave, so</li>
<li> If you didn&#x27;t have such a smooth shave, you will feel a sting.</li>
<li> I cannot believe such a cheap after-shave has worked out so well for me.</li>
<li> But be ready -</li>
<li> i shave with a straight edge, not a safety razor.</li>
<li> Even my WIFE really likes it</li>
<li> and she&#x27;s really picky about what she likes me</li>
<li> really strong.&lt;br /</li>
<li> and what I really like about</li>
<li> Barber Shop and Smelling like a real man.</li>
<li> Who wants to smell like they just strolled through a forest or went skinny dipping in the ocean?  </li>
<li> Not for date night but very inexpensive.</li>
<li> Because it really doesn&#x27;t matter.  </li>
<li> Those are both good things, to me at least.. Hehehe.</li>
<li> Sure it&#x27;s old man after shave but back then men were men!</li>
<li> The downer to me is the scent lingers all day and it kind of has a powdery tone after a few hours.  </li>
<li> Smells like a old time barber shop, women like it too !!!</li>
<li> One six ounce bottle has lasted me for several months, so it is a very economical buy as well.</li>
<li> It smells good, I like it, but I would prefer it was a little less strong..</li>
<li> I could smell it the rest of the day, and I even caught a quick whiff of it when I first got in the shower the next morning.  </li>
<li> It smells much closer to Magno, but since Magno is only slightly familiar here now in the U.S.</li>
<li> Good stuff, no more bumps and reminds me of when my dad would go to the old school barbers!</li>
<li> This is a pleasant scent, but not super masculine like Old Spice.</li>
<li> I do like to mix it up between Virgin Island Bay Rum, this, and other more modern colognes.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a classic, fresh, masculine scent.</li>
<li> I love this classic sent that wakes up and softens your skin after a wet shave.  </li>
<li> When I first got this product I was surprised at how large the bottle was.</li>
<li> I love this stuff and look forward to trying other Pinaud products.</li>
<li> There are two other things that this product is famous for. 1</li>
<li> I&#x27;m sure other people don&#x27;t smell cat urine</li>
<li> has the same original smell as the Original back in the Days.</li>
<li> It does not last very long and has a very sweet smell that is kind of overwhelming and not pleasant.</li>
<li> So, I tried it the first time this morning and there was no hurtful stinging on my tender skin, I found that it would be okay for me as the sting was almost missing.  </li>
<li> Fast shipment and now all the older ladies keep sniffing around .......</li>
<li> Definitely makes you smell like you just got a clean shave.</li>
<li> Nice powdery scent, long lasting.</li>
<li> I usually use Acqa Velva but love this product and the price is right.</li>
<li> But be aware that you will have an old man scent.  </li>
<li> #34;clean&amp;#34; without being flowery, sweet, or fruity which is what I&#x27;m personally after.</li>
<li> Definitely a tried and true scent.</li>
<li> you&#x27;re more of a fan of a more modern scent (unfortunately, my wife is)</li>
<li> I have sensitive skin and it never fails to sooth after i shave.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s pretty much completely gone after an hour.  </li>
<li> will smell like you just stepped out of an old timey barbershop where Clarence gave you a close shave and a hot towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It definitely has an&amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; fragrance, but that&#x27;s not bad.</li>
<li> I love the fragrance of this particular one, Not sure how much its is effective in killing germs and protecting skin as I have bene using this only since last 3 weeks but its good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It smells better than some of the more expensive colognes I own although it does not last very long.</li>
<li> It has a rather strong, complex scent that reminds me of an old fashioned barbershop, the kind where the barber used a big straight razor the size of a meat cleaver to shave you.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a big fan of classic aftershaves, but clubman has helped me to realize that I don&#x27;t like sweet, powdery, and floral scents.</li>
<li> Or maybe I had touched a live electrical wire to my face!  </li>
<li> Few have unique, generally enjoyable fragrances that women sill actually compliment on.</li>
<li> It smells fresh and clean with slight scent of baby powder.  </li>
<li> I love the smell, healing and slight burn.</li>
<li> This after shave has been a classic for generations.</li>
<li> Classic aftershave at a bargain price</li>
<li> A classic.</li>
<li> Will most likely always be an item next to my shaving</li>
<li> It reminds me of a classic barber shop.</li>
<li> The fragance is classic and you&#x27;ll feel you are celebrating V-E day, or just smell</li>
<li> As a classic \\&quot;drugstore\\&quot; type product, it is decent.  </li>
<li> Just a classic aftershave.  </li>
<li> The classic.  </li>
<li> Clubman is one of the classic afterhshaves used by barbers for generations.</li>
<li> Oh, what a manly classic smell.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s still around because its a classic.</li>
<li> its a classic smell.</li>
<li> It smells like you just got a shave from a classic, hole in the wall, barber shop, like our fathers, uncles, grandfathers, etc.</li>
<li> Classic scent.</li>
<li> The scent is the same and the application of splashing on face and refreshing the skin is also no different.</li>
<li> /&gt;It is a classic smell.</li>
<li> In addition to the smell, I don&#x27;t find that this product is particularly soothing to the skin.  </li>
<li> After splashing some Clubman on I feel like my iron jawed grandfather after coming home from World War 2 and killing Nazi&#x27;s and procreating with many French and Italian women.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a smell that is timeless and classic.</li>
<li> I bought some of the &#x27;classic&#x27; aftershaves to use after I shave, which is at home in the evening when nobody else can smell me</li>
<li> I swear i had a couple older women linger stares after coming close by.</li>
<li> It didn&#x27;t smell like a cologne, but at the same time it was more than just the soap they used that morning, highly likely it was this stuff.</li>
<li> For my main or Daytime after shave</li>
<li> I agree with the reviews about it having that classic smell to it.</li>
<li> didn&#x27;t particularly care for the scent</li>
<li> Classic scent.</li>
<li> The classic.  </li>
<li> so you can tell it&#x27;s a classic.</li>
<li> I guess some things are just classic</li>
<li> There is only a mild sting.</li>
<li> Classic scent.  </li>
<li> Classic barber shop smell.  </li>
<li> Clubman Pinaud is a classic aftershave.</li>
<li> A classic scent for any man</li>
<li> i would think it&#x27;s a classic one for after shaving</li>
<li> But if you grew up in a certain era, you got your haircut by a guy named Louie in a barber shop with three or four big stuffed waiting chairs and a table full of old Field and Stream magazines.</li>
<li> This is a product that will last you for a long time, like many people have said, it is very strong so just a few drops will do it.</li>
<li> It has a unique smell and it lasts a long time.</li>
<li> Not sure if i&#x27;m old enough for this smell lol.</li>
<li> Highly recommend.</li>
<li> highly recommend it.</li>
<li> I recommend it highly.</li>
<li> I highly recommend it.</li>
<li> Had high hopes for this one.</li>
<li> This stuff smells to high heaven and burns like hell.</li>
<li> and I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
<li> Highly recommended.  </li>
<li> Want to smell like some cheese-eating high school boy?  </li>
<li> Highly recommended.</li>
<li> The minute you open the bottle for the first time and smell this stuff, you&#x27;ll feel like you stepped right into the old barber shop that your father took you to as a child.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a bit strong and flowery when it first goes on, but that doesn&#x27;t last too long.  </li>
<li> Definitely has a unique, old manish, barber shoppy smell.  </li>
<li> I would describe the smell as masculine yes, at the same time inviting and accessible.</li>
<li> So you&#x27;ve got your Merkur safety razor, Taylor of Old Bond Street Lavender shaving cream, &amp; Escali pure badger hair shaving brush.</li>
<li> So yeah i think i like it a little more now plustons of comps from the girls in my life.</li>
<li> It sooth the face, but i still use a post shave lotion to rehydrate my skin a little more.  </li>
<li> I wish it burned a little more,...</li>
<li> I first sniffed it and it reminded me of the cheap Brut aftershave my mother put in my Christmas stocking as a little kid</li>
<li> quickly got over that phase and went back to my old Gillette Super Speed razor with double edge blades.  </li>
<li> As for the smell, it is some potent stuff, but once it airs out a little bit it leaves a very manly smell, one like in the old days.</li>
<li> It has a strangely familiar yet unique quality to it that is hard to explain</li>
<li> I bought several different kinds of Pinaud aftershave and cologne, and some Lucky tiger when i stated shaving with my old Gellette razors again, Wanted that old time Barber smell from my youth, and I was not disappointed, Would recommend</li>
<li> Do not expect any citrus scent, it is straight up masculine.      </li>
<li> Started using a DE safety razor and bought some Clubman Pinaud to complete the whole retro purchase.  </li>
<li> When you splash this on, be careful because you will feel yourself transforming into a &amp;#34; take no crap from any woman&amp;#34; type of man.</li>
<li> Wow, this aftershave is absolutely life changing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I really wanted Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood</li>
<li> I really like the smell, it&#x27;s strangely masculine.</li>
<li> She said it smells too much like an old man.</li>
<li> Smell is okay, but dried my face out and didn&#x27;t take care of razor burn.</li>
<li> After 56 years, I have finally been rewarded for being a man and the wait, as some of you see it, has been well worth it.</li>
<li> It was cute when Macaulay Culkin made a big deal about it in 1990, but he was TEN YEARS OLD.</li>
<li> It was cute when Macaulay Culkin made a big deal about it in 1990, but he was TEN YEARS OLD.</li>
<li> My wife says it makes me smell like an old lady, which I find funny, because I didn&#x27;t know old ladies smelled of manliness.  </li>
<li> I usually don&#x27;t like perfumes and aftershaves (too many sons, too much Axe), but this was so</li>
<li> If you are old enough to remember going to a man&#x27;s barber shop -- barber pole, straight razor, brush and talc on the back of your neck, old men swapping stories -- then you&#x27;ll love it, too.</li>
<li> I will admit it brought back memories of straight razors and hot lather.</li>
<li> smells like I just left a barbershop with a fresh cut aka Pinaud&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> My wife especially - it gives her more of an excuse to \\&quot;get close.\\&quot;  </li>
<li> If you want to smell classy, and like a true gentleman who&#x27;s got his act together, definitely pick up a bottle!</li>
<li> i have many more expensive after shaves but clubman is old world charm of things</li>
<li> overall worth trying</li>
<li> Very good astringent characteristics and a fantastic manly scent that unfortunately doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
<li> You really have to put it on and wait a minute or two for it to calm down before you judge the quality of this cologne because it&#x27;s overpowering at first.</li>
<li> I highly suggest this to anyone looking for a new after shave, whether you are a beginner or just feeling daring.</li>
<li> The second thing is that every time you open the bottle the lights go out and a beam of light shines down upon the bottle and angels begin to sing, which is not a problem for me however it wakes my wife up each morning and she is becoming frustrated, luckily once she smells my beautiful manly musk</li>
<li> This after shave burns far more than any other I have ever used, but hey, when the label states it&#x27;s highly flammable, one shouldn&#x27;t be surprised.</li>
<li> You&#x27;ll find the lotion dries down nicely leaving your face toned and smooth...and smelling like a new haircut in the North Bronx back in 1955.</li>
<li> Bathe me in this stuff and send me to the nearest senior center.&lt;br /&gt;Minus one half star for Clubman Pinaud making me me love smelling like an old man at a nightclub and</li>
<li> Most inexpensive fragrances depart as soon as they dry, but this one hangs in there from Pearl Harbor to V-E day and back again.</li>
<li> The short answer is &amp;#34;barbershop&amp;#34;, as in you&#x27;ll smell like you do right after a haircut.</li>
<li> Some of the other barbers I work with have been using other high end products which does a better job at soothing freshly shaved skin without the sting.</li>
<li> Its mainly alcohol (I&#x27;m pretty sure the bottle actually warns the user to keep it away from open flames), which tends to dry one&#x27;s skin.  </li>
<li> Be aware, you cannot return this due to Amazon&#x27;s policy about hazardous/flammable materials (yes, it&#x27;s that powerful).</li>
<li> Brings back great memories of that fresh haircut before the big game on Friday nights.</li>
<li> After having it on a while it calms to a pretty subtle scent which i am enjoying.</li>
<li> This is a man&#x27;s aftershave, you&#x27;ll be reminded of better days of past, when your pappy took you to the barber shop, and those old barbers that told war stories, cut your hair with real scissors and blade.</li>
<li> At first smell it really seems like any generic old school aftershave.</li>
<li> Amazon is offering this Clubman Pinaud on the \\&quot;add-on\\&quot; program for free shipping with other items</li>
<li> And so what if it does smell like your grandfather, he was probably more man than u little young ones today</li>
<li> /&gt;I might have to start a new slang, Pinaud now means &amp;#34;Fresh&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I am thinking new one to be gift for my friends</li>
<li> Never buy a new fragrance for a guy.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a classic smell, almost an old man smell.</li>
<li> Nice subtle smell.</li>
<li> Classic old school aftershave.</li>
<li> Old school scent I recall from the older men in my family.</li>
<li> I am also going to try the Old Spice classic aftershave  </li>
<li> Some days you just feel that swagger and this 200 year old classic aftershave ties it all together.</li>
<li> Old timey, but classic.  </li>
<li> But it&#x27;s Pinaud for me all the way - reminds me of an old classic barber shop.</li>
<li> Classic scent - reminds me of the old school barber shops.</li>
<li> I have to point out that this is a odor for mature men, like 25 and older.</li>
<li> If you have to say that this is scent is classic, it means you smell like an old man.  </li>
<li> So for those delicate situations where you need a good but moderate</li>
<li> It really does take care of those inevitable shaving nicks with out too much stinging.</li>
<li> I only recently found that it is available in this aftershave version.  </li>
<li> Reminds me of the old classic men&#x27;s cologne, Canoe.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little pungent at first (not to the point of stinging the nostrils or anything) but it dissipates quickly</li>
<li> Smells classy and classic without making me smell like an old man!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a very old fashion scent.</li>
<li> very old man-ey.</li>
<li> IT&#x27;s a very masculine feel to the scent.</li>
<li> ; It smells very classy and refined, without being too overbearing.</li>
<li> My dad worked at Country Club when I was very young.</li>
<li> It smell very masculine.  </li>
<li> My Dad passed away at a very early age, and this was the cologne he used to wear.</li>
<li> It lingers strong for only a little bit but comes back lightly throughout the day.</li>
<li> I do worry a little about smelling like an old man, and perhaps I have gone from 13 year old girls to women who are 6x better:</li>
<li> Will use the product up, and will most likely not re-order, especially if the classic Old Spice does the same for me.  </li>
<li> it calms down quickly yet lasts until the evening if someone is very close to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I started cutting my own hair after going to a barber for 20 years that used the original Pinaud.</li>
<li> This wasnt as widely used back in the day as Old Spice and Brut, those are more grandfather type.</li>
<li> I guess since I&#x27;m getting old, I should start wearing this!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s old school!</li>
<li> So this is a simple mixture with some recognizable stuff</li>
<li> If it&#x27;s the same stuff I used to buy at the barber shop when I was 14 or 15, this is the first aftershave I used,  </li>
<li> I used this aftershave for the first time last night.</li>
<li> I had no idea the scent would be so linked to my past, but I&#x27;ve really enjoyed wearing it.</li>
<li> He may not be able to act worth a crap, but he sure as hell carried himself like he did.</li>
<li> When I put it on after shaving, it stung for a couple seconds but let me know I&#x27;m alive!</li>
<li> How can the smell be the exact same as 45 years ago?</li>
<li> The first time I splashed this on my face the thought that came to mind was I possibly just stuck my face into a hornets nest!</li>
<li> Wow!</li>
<li> The third is that the unicorn that appeared after my first bottle won&#x27;t go away</li>
<li> I remember my old barber, I was too young for  the shave, but remember haircut,  the powder and the tonic, The brush on back of the neck,&lt;br /&gt;The fresh haircut</li>
<li> It starts more floral, and then dries to a unique scent that is difficult for me to describe.</li>
<li> You will smell fresh all day long.</li>
<li> And no, I&#x27;m not that old (still under 40)!  </li>
<li> I switch back and forth between a straight razor, and a double-edged safety razor, and there&#x27;s no better way to finish off a classic shave, than with a healthy splash of Clubman.</li>
<li> Not very effective, after shave you apply I feel good but not very concentrated</li>
<li> It is quite strong, just a little bit will wake you up in the morning.</li>
<li> Forget about the reviews that claim this will make you smell like an old man--if you want to smell like a teenager, buy Axe, but if you want to smell like a grown man, try a classic scent that has been around longer than anyone alive today.</li>
<li> This after shave has a clean, traditional smell that reminds me of the Saturday morning haircuts I had as a kid way back in the 1960s.</li>
<li> Aside from this and the Bay Rum I also used the Special Reserve and of the 3, this is the only one I would never wear in public.</li>
<li> /&gt;Having tried Proraso first, I am going back now and staying clear of Pinaud</li>
<li> As an everyday aftershave, this does the job and goes easy on the wallet.</li>
<li> Just a quick splash in wet hands and apply to face.</li>
<li> To be honest, sentimental scent is the only reason I bought this.</li>
<li> Goes on kinda strong, but it mellows out a bit and stays for quite a few hours.  </li>
<li> The fragrance is advertised as masculine, but in my personal opinion smelling strongly of any product is not particularly manly.  </li>
<li> Not until you&#x27;ve looked death squarely in the face, several times, and have been married long enough to understand there&#x27;s nothing really better, and not until you finally grow some real manners and stop dressing and acting like you just don&#x27;t give a damn.</li>
<li> It is an acquired taste to wear this everyday sadly I do not have that taste right now maybe in 20 years.</li>
<li> This is because even many unisex salons typically finish a haircut with Pinaud&#x27;s talcum powder, and this has some of the same smell.</li>
<li> Over the last year or so, I have bought and used five different after shave lotions - Lucky Tiger, Proraso, Pinaud Clubman, and Captain&#x27;s Choice (Bay Rum and Sandalwood).</li>
<li> But it cools your face and leaves it tight and smooth.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it does smell good but in public it may have people mistaking your swag as cheap vegas gambler which is clearly not the case.</li>
<li> I gave this to him with his first straight razor and other shaving products.</li>
<li> I was smart enough to start using this stuff when I was 15, and I still get compliments.  </li>
<li> Not for teens, need to have lived a little to enjoy this.</li>
<li> I like it but a little light on the scent for me.</li>
<li> Not after using this you won&#x27;t because splashing it onto your face after a fresh shave fills each and everyone of your pores and cuts with little lemon squeezing ninjas who infuse a painful level of awesome into your morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I am not a fan of the smell - a little more masculine than baby powder but definitely has a hint of it.</li>
<li> Now for background, I do love the smells of some classic barber shop after shaves and shaving creams but this one isn&#x27;t the one for me.&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, this leaves your face very dry and tight.</li>
<li> secret in the manufacturing process is rather amazing.</li>
<li> Overall a great scent and for $6 a bottle you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
<li> Would much rather go for the regular old spice after shave smell over this.</li>
<li> The smell of this reminds me of what my old man used to smell like.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s the old school tonic type stuff.</li>
<li> Reminds me of an old fashioned barbor shop.</li>
<li> But there&#x27;s something about Clubman aftershave that makes me forget about unisex hair salons and makes me think of a barber shop (complete with the red and blue pole outside, sitting and reading papers and magazines until your turn in the chair comes up, and the sound of snipping scissors and the smalltalk you get from your barber.  </li>
<li> it makes a complete after bath freshner.</li>
<li> There is a fear among young guys of using fragrances of yesteryear, the &amp;#34;I&#x27;d smell like an old man&amp;#34; mentality.  </li>
<li> Old school barber shop</li>
<li> I should of paid attention to the reviews that said it smells like old man.</li>

<li> I like the way it smells because I like old school stuff</li>
<li> and this is as old school as it gets.  </li>
<li> I was worried about the smell of this aftershave as I have never used it but was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
<li> Wow.</li>
<li> It truly is classy in the sense that you smell like a gentleman who just got cleaned up for a day with his gal.</li>
<li> smell is that of the old school.  </li>
<li> and then you find yourself dabbing some on your 1 and 1/2 year old son so you can both smell manly</li>
<li> It has a classic,clean, masculine scent that lingers without being over powering.</li>
<li> It stings, it burns, but not too much - just enough to let you know that you are a man.  </li>

<li> I can definitely feel when I put it on, but it doesn&#x27;t sting... much.</li>
<li> After I apply it I go back over my face with a hydrating face lotion made by Lo&#x27;real.</li>

<li> I rediscovered the old after shaves and haven&#x27;t looked back.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never frequented an old school barbershop, but that seems to be the consensus on the smell.  </li>
<li> LIke an old time barber shop.</li>
<li> Smells like the barber shop and drives the ladies with (grand-)daddy issues wild.</li>
<li> I read all the reviews for this product and wanted to try it for a change from my OLD SPICE regimen ...</li>
<li> MASCULINE, BUT STINGY</li>
<li> My old man likes it.  </li>
<li> It helps with razor burn, sensitive skin, and also serves as a moisteurizer.</li>
<li> This stuff is totally old school.</li>
<li> After you use it, it smells like you stepped out if an old timey barber shop.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
<li> You&#x27;ll smell like a man, not like a 13 year old boy.</li>
<li> phew, stanky and every time I get near anyone wearing it, it even rubs off on me and stays with all day till I take a shower and change cloth, like running into a skunk.</li>
<li> Clubman reminds me of back in the day, old time barber shops that would apply Clubman after giving you an old fashioned straight edge shave.</li>
<li> Old school barbershop + Country Club +</li>
<li> Smells like an old time barber shop, where everyone is your friend.</li>

<li> It smells classy.</li>
<li> As a young man living in France, a university student, I would splurge once every couple of months with a haircut and a shave in a barbershop.  </li>
<li> It has the old school smell of a shave.</li>
<li> so I don&#x27;t know what the &#x27;old barber shop smell&#x27; smells like.</li>
<li> Old Spice and this is irresistible.</li>
<li> old school Joe da Barba</li>
<li> It does burn a bit going on but hasn&#x27;t caused any problems to my quite sensitive skin.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m completely amazed that I haven&#x27;t heard of this sooner.</li>
<li> I like the masculine smell a lot</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re looking for an old fashioned after shave, this is for you.</li>
<li> It reminds me of the old days when men were men.</li>
<li> That is my least favorite scent of all time and</li>
<li> like the smell (which fades fairly early on)</li>
<li> Clubman is the smell of an old school barber shop.</li>
<li> My wife won&#x27;t even come near me until this evaporates.  </li>
<li> Does soothe the skin though, and your wife might find the smell of an old guy alluring.</li>
<li> Maybe I&#x27;ll try the straight razor next?</li>
<li> You will smell like you just came out of an old barbershop.  </li>
<li> Its scent comes too close to \\&quot;old</li>
<li> Reminds me of the old days when we went to a barber for hair cut.</li>
<li> After reading the reviews about Clubman Pinaud smelling like the barber shops of old I decided to give it a try.</li>
<li> Smells like a cologne a 15 year old boy would pour all over himself.</li>
<li> Heck, splash some on midday so you can feel alive again.    </li>
<li> Pardon the Old Spice reference, but I had to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The scent is quite dapper and reminds me of an old barber shop.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using it for my customers after all straight razor shaves, but I think I&#x27;m going to switch it up for the my next after shave purchase.</li>
<li> The only after shave I have really used.</li>
<li> So if you have sensitive skin be warned.</li>
<li> Classy.</li>
<li> be surprised if the ladies notice your smell before your three wolf moon t-shirt aura.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I could see it having some zings if you have sensitive skin or are prone to nicking yourself.</li>
<li> Ordered third time really like it.</li>
<li> Clubman is old school.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not an old timer</li>
<li> Smells like an old timey barber shop.</li>
<li> /&gt;The only after shave / cologne you really need, without spending</li>
<li> Old school barbershop smell.</li>
<li> have sensitive skin and have not any problems using this product.</li>
<li> Try the Old Spice.  </li>
<li> Fast forward years later, and I&#x27;m trying to move up in my company.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a old fashioned masculine smell.</li>
<li> I do really love this stuff and have not received a negative comment from anyone regarding the aroma, in fact, quite the contrary.</li>
<li> Smells like root beer, old ladies, diapers, and plastic</li>
<li> (I have a proraso and old spice</li>
<li> You see that pimping action figure on the bottle?  </li>
<li> Its an old timer product but will never get old for me.</li>
<li> Old time barbershop smell.  </li>
<li> i higly recomend the product you will feel young again and renewed</li>
<li> Old, musty and sweetish.</li>
<li> My wife&#x27;s #1 complain on this after shave lotion is the smell of \\&quot;old man\\&quot;.  </li>
<li> I apply witch hazel after I shave and then apply pinaud a few minutes later and love this combination.</li>
<li> Alas, it gave me a headache, as most aftershaves do, and has been given to a friend, who absolutely loves it.</li>
<li> I tried it a few times to be sure, and each time it caused red blotches on my face.</li>
<li> the slight sting with the first splash tells you that the bracer is working leaving you feeling invigorated and ready to go.  </li>
<li> Burns a little, but totally worth it!</li>
<li> /&gt;Lastly, if I didn&#x27;t see such a big deal being made of the alcohol sting in so many reviews (not just here, but other aftershaves too)</li>
<li> /&gt;Lastly, if I didn&#x27;t see such a big deal being made of the alcohol sting in so many reviews (not just here, but other aftershaves too)</li>
<li> Women seem to enjoy it as they are subconsciously attracted (due to evolutionary beginnings).</li>
<li> Also, when an after shave causes any razor burns and minor cuts to sting, I feel like I am doing something positive to treat them,</li>
<li> although, it is heavy on the cinniman, Dominica Original Bay Rum.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t like colones and prefer the more subtle aftershaves.  </li>
<li> A lot of people I know use the mainstream after shave lotion, but I&#x27;ve received various compliments from using this classic after shave lotion.</li>
<li> I just started straight shaving not too long ago and needed an aftershave that would &amp;#34;calm&amp;#34; my sensitive skin after the shave.</li>
<li> Such a classic smell.</li>
<li> Well, this stuff had so many 5 star reviews but with such a small price, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.  </li>
<li> At the beginning, the smell is a little strong, but after several times use, i got used to the smell.</li>
<li> Scent dries down nicely and hangs around for a few hours.</li>
<li> The price is low but the quality is high.  </li>
<li> This is becoming hard to find in the drug stores.</li>
<li> Clubman Pinaud is the new old man standard.  </li>
<li> If you say bro, tight, or take selfies, get some axe body spray you arent worthy.</li>
<li> When I decided spray on colognes were generally easier and more convenient than having my splash-on aftershave pull double duty, ended up using the regular clubman a lot less often.</li>
<li> - deep down you feel you&#x27;re old enough and ready for something as powerful as Clubman Pinaud</li>
<li> it&#x27;s all win; if you two aren&#x27;t that serious, it&#x27;s a small purchase.</li>
<li> It works well to stop any minor weepers you might have, and the scent is classic, old school barbershop.  </li>
<li> /&gt;However, here is a word of advice to anyone who is new to old-school wetshaving: if you really want to reduce skin irritation after shaving with a blade, don&#x27;t use this, or any other alcohol-based aftershave.  </li>
<li> The product&#x27;s smell reminds me a little of either classic Old Spice or Stetson aftershaves (can&#x27;t really remember which...</li>
<li> Slight burn, refreshing aroma and lasts longer then other after shaves I&#x27;ve used although don&#x27;t confuse it with a cologne.</li>
<li> This coincided with giving up my double edge, safety razor for the newly advertised &amp;#34;triple blade, disposable razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> even if you have to buy their entire lineup to find one you like, it would still be cheaper than most of those trendy expensive brands that smell great but feel terrible after a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It is much more complex and refined than aqua velva or similar by-the-gallon, sanitizer after shaves.</li>
<li> exactly like I just got out of an extra long gym class</li>
<li> However its fallen off that list of late because there is one problem with a distinctive unusual aftershave that&#x27;s strong smelling enough to double as a cologne</li>
<li> Immediately after applying it, I was transported back to barber shops with straight edge razors and combs soaking in blue barbicide.  </li>
<li> Sharp sting when first applied, so stay away if you don&#x27;t like that.  </li>
<li> Although this works fantastically as an aftershave, and I&#x27;ll probably never be without a bottle, this is definitely below 4711 Aftershave and Pinaud&#x27;s Vanilla Clubman for me personally now, because they do a better job of letting my spray cologne (usually Azzaro Pour Homme or Cerruti 1881) do its job.</li>
<li> As my first aftershave, I will probably explore other options to decide whether or not I like Clubman.</li>
<li> People say it dries down to a powdery smell, but to me the powdery smell is the initial smell, which goes away thankfully, and leaves the masterpiece behind which lasts a great amount of time by the way</li>
<li> Scent is a tad strong when initially slapped on but soon fades and not overwhelming.  </li>
<li> Classic and lasts long.</li>
<li> It may burn a little but it is worth it.  </li>
<li> You can not find a better value anywhere; Clubman is a solid mainstay for any serious shave den.</li>
<li> , you got a lotta boot left to fill.\\&quot; Clubman smells classic, traditional, and manly.  </li>
<li> should have had some free flowing nozzle type neck, The current opening hole pours around the edge of bottle sometimes so bit tough to collect and as this product has benzene it vapourizes very soon.</li>
<li> General Baddassery.&lt;br /&gt;Too</li>
<li> /&gt;This is a very distince scent, but it doesn&#x27;t linger forever, just long enough.</li>
<li> Like getting in a time machine and going back to an old school barber shop.</li>
<li> The second thing Pinaud is known for is making you smell, &amp;#34;like an old guy&amp;#34;.</li>
<li> Bring back some old memories when your dad took you to the barbershop for that burr cut</li>
<li> I&#x27;m 44 and this reminds me of the barber shop I got my haircuts back in the early 70&#x27;s.</li>
<li> I used to apply old spice after shave but for some reason I stopped applying after shave for the last 5 yrs.</li>
<li> I have, as I mentioned, über sensitive skin, and this has an initial, invigorating heat to it, but it doesn&#x27;t burn at all.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know that a youngster could carry this off, but if you&#x27;re old enough to wear a beret without looking like you&#x27;re in costume, this would work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> /&gt;It brings back memories of an old barbershop....</li>
<li> Takes you back to the old barber shop days.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used everything from Taylor Of Old Bond Street, Myrsol Blue, Jovan ...... ect.</li>
<li> While I find the odor pleasing and timeless, apparently, it reminds women of their grandfathers.  </li>
<li> A professional doctor or lawyer would likely be happier with something from an upscale dept store.</li>
<li> While your face is a bit wet, put 2 shakes of the lotion in the palm of your hand and gently apply to face and neck.</li>
<li> while not overpowering yet it isn&#x27;t completely gone after say 20 mins outside.  </li>
<li> Am I the only person here who thinks this stuff smells just like Old Spice?</li>
<li> Sure, Clubman is like a thousand tiny daggers stabbing your face, but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
<li> You will likely be surprised as well.</li>
<li> If you had an irritating shave, it will sting a bit more.  </li>
<li> so yes, I still use it, but honestly it&#x27;s just kinda weird because I feel like I&#x27;m splashing on bottled cat urine.</li>
<li> I had been using some kind of expensive froo-froo stuff  </li>
<li> There&#x27;s a little bite when you apply any alcohol-based aftershave right after shaving, but who cares.  </li>
<li> There&#x27;s a little bite when you apply any alcohol-based aftershave right after shaving, but who cares.  </li>
<li> I use it fairly sparingly and actually only use on half my face while I use Proraso refresh on the other half</li>
<li> I used this aftershave for the first time today when i purchased it with a single bladed razor and some other products for a new shaving regimen.</li>
<li> It is fresh, crisp, starts out sharp and then tones down to an almost baby powder smell and lasts a long time.</li>
<li> Much like the other reviews- definite old time barber shop feel.  </li>
<li> This is the only fragrance that I consistently receive compliments on and that has never happened with any other cologne/fragrance in my life.</li>
<li> I agree with other reviewers, this is a very manly fragrance.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s also very affordable but it beats any other aftershave on the market at any price.</li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;i use also other prouducts  from Pinaud&lt;br /&gt;item came fast.  </li>
<li> /&gt;After the first use, I had 10 different women at work give me their phone numbers, and two more send me dirty pictures via email.  </li>
<li> I love the way it feels on my face but the scent is a little heavy for me.</li>
<li> This smell reminds me of a fresh haircut that I got as a little boy at the local barber shop.</li>
<li> I also find the scent quite strong; I usually rinse my face a few minutes after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, it gets 4 stars from me, mainly because it works so well as an after shave product.  </li>
<li> I had to order, Not a single regret either.</li>
<li> A great product standing firm in an industry that is being plastered by all sorts of random things.</li>
<li> Have also gotten my 70 year old father back on the double edge and sent this to him.</li>
<li> That in itself doesn&#x27;t seem so bad except it is REALLY strong and it stays strong for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> So either this smells great or my cologne stinks!</li>
<li> Has a tiny bit of a burn, but for me it&#x27;s barely there.</li>
<li> but then again i always shower with hot shower and use heavy bar soap on my face</li>
<li> Recently started wet shaving and wanted something classic to follow the shaving process with.</li>
<li> and I find it actually really cuts down on razor burn/nicks.</li>
<li> first, when you open the bottle and splash it on your hands the scent is  a little skunky.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never had sensitive skin or or a dry skin problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Has a bit of an old man smell, but it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
<li> But this is a good scent for the average guy or practically anyone else on a casual, weekend / vacation.</li>
<li> I have had very sensitive skin shaving for as long as I can remember to the point that I really only shaved once every third day or so and only with the grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I picked up a bottle of Clubmans at my local pharmacy one day not long after breaking up with my girlfriend.</li>
<li> I wanted to try a new after shave lotion since I recently began wet shaving.</li>
<li> I thought it was going to be this tiny little thing, but it is quite large about the size of a stick deodorant.</li>
<li> If you spent any amount of time in a barbershop, you&#x27;ll be familiar with the scent as Clubman Pinaud is the usual go-to aftershave in those establishments.</li>
<li> I was a little disappointed by this based on all the great reviews mainly because I built it up to be different.  </li>
<li> a picture of you in your new car the other day, looking Pinaud!&amp;#34; (Pronounced Pee-No)&lt;br</li>
<li> i was shocked how fast it arrived and that i was still able to buy it on amazon</li>
<li> I have tried a couple of their other scents and not enjoyed them, but I like the Classic Vanila almost as much as the Clubman, believe it or not.</li>
<li> It is very harsh at first, but that is how you know it is doing its job of closing the pores.</li>
<li> When I was a teen I would get a high and tight and they would shave the sides of my head, then apply this.  </li>
<li> I much prefer Pinaud&#x27;s Lime Sec, as well as other brands&#x27; Bay Rum aftershaves.</li>
<li> I personally prefer the Prorazo product it burns plenty but has other natural soothing elements vs just alcohol and scent.  </li>
<li> I keep bottle of it, put it on a cotton ball, and suck it into the vacuum cleaner.</li>
<li> This thing is even better than colon seriously !!</li>
<li> After a classic shave with my double edge razor a few splashes of this</li>
<li> Nah, this stuff is manly and classic and only costs a few bucks.</li>
<li> Use that sharp blade in your DE old school razor.</li>
<li> Or some other old man scent.</li>
<li> Clean scent that will not be confused with foo-foo cologne.</li>
<li> This one is by far my least favorite which is a nicer way of saying my most hated.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this aftershave for a week straight and my skin feels smoother than it has in the past.</li>
<li> not sure how much I like it.</li>
<li> Reasonably priced, given the small amount you have to use.  </li>
<li> now I&#x27;ll just see how long the scent will last on my face..</li>
<li> For me, it was definitely long lasting.  </li>
<li> It will literally last all day long.</li>
<li> Nice scent, but very, very faint scent.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure that he used this particular product, but the smell is definitely similar.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t walk down the street without being harassed by buxom young filly&#x27;s.</li>
<li> There are very few aftershaves which I really prefer to repeat, this being one of them.</li>
<li> If you work hard for your money don&#x27;t waste it on this cheap after shave.</li>
<li> Yeah, every read head around and any other nearby broad with \\&quot;daddy issues\\&quot; will start bugging you.</li>
<li> It definitely feels good after every shave, but the smell is bad enough to warrant a 1 less star.  </li>
<li> It reminds me with the Eighties when I was less than 5 years old.</li>
<li> I think it sort of reminds me of Avon&#x27;s Skin So Soft or Magno Black Glycerin Soap by La Toja.</li>
<li> Surely if it is that cheap it must be horrible.  </li>
<li> In any case, the initial blast of aroma is not pleasant for me but the scent does open up within minutes and has slowly but surely become one of the favorites in my medicine cabinet.</li>
<li> The smell is very masculine but not so heavy as to burn your nose hairs out.</li>
<li> She usually doesn&#x27;t like any of my previous after shave lotions (25 years worth)</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve taken to mixing it with witch hazel at about a 1:1 ratio in the palm of my hand before applying; I like the astringent properties of the witch hazel, and it means using half as much aftershave which cuts down on the intensity of the scent.&lt;br</li>
<li> It is a classic Gentleman&#x27;s smell, that reminds me of days gone past.</li>
<li> Smells a little like Old Spice if you&#x27;re wondering.</li>
<li> It was a little too old fashion smelling for my hubby, so I kept it for shaving my legs..</li>
<li> I am little concerned how this will react on a sensitive acned skin.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to describe a scent, really, but spicy and astrignent would be how I would describe Clubman.  </li>
<li> First few seconds burn a little</li>
<li> I even tried cutting it 50-50 with witch hazel, and that was better</li>
<li> I tried cutting it with some water, and that was a bit better.</li>
<li> I purchased this in my attempt to bring back the smell of the old Barber Shops that were around when I was a small boy.  </li>
<li> Only a small amount is needed, so this 6 ounce container goes far.</li>
<li> My wife said I smell like an old man dead in a casket.</li>
<li> but I notice it lasts a LONG time, which I like.</li>
<li> Not a loud, polarizing, aggressive cologne scent.</li>
<li> I recently got into wet shaving with DE razors</li>
<li> Now, I&#x27;m not a young guy.</li>
<li> After seeing this stuff and realizing how long this company had been in business and seeing the reviews</li>
<li> B0066GR55K Captain&#x27;s Choice Bay Rum Aftershave]] that I bought not too long ago, although she does like the Captain&#x27;s Choice as well</li>
<li> A bottle lasts a long time.</li>
<li> It goes a long ways though.</li>
<li> Eleck razors just take too long.</li>
<li> It does zap my minor cuts, if any and then refreshes your face.</li>
<li> This stuff is primal and has triggered something in my brain that&#x27;s been dormant for that long.</li>
<li> this product has exist from long ago and the barber shops used this product.&lt;br /&gt;Fresh smelling</li>
<li> , it stays with you for a long time and you can sense it all the time.</li>
<li> He actually started wet shaving because of Clubman.</li>
<li> it will stay with you all day long.  </li>
<li> I am a middle aged man that wanted something way off track from all the &amp;#34;Extreme Sport/Waterfall/Energy&amp;#34;</li>
<li> My wide lives the way I smell after saving, and my after shave cocktail hour in the bar never seems to repulse any of the opposite sex dither.</li>
<li> /&gt;There&#x27;s probably a reason this stuff has been around for a long time.</li>
<li> My husband was too surprised by my behavior to be made uncomfortable by it, and had become interested in the answer as well.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Are</li>
<li> and you&#x27;d really have to be something slow to not buy</li>
<li> and I mean really, dislikes it.  </li>
<li> After only one bottle of Clubman Pinaud, I&#x27;m not even going to consider any other aftershave for a long, long time.</li>
<li> its is very hard product to find and its old school barber shop smell i remember as a child getting applied bye the old fashion barber in my town</li>
<li> The only other thing is that my girlfriend and I joke about how I smell like a grandfather, but she loves it either way.</li>
<li> The mens club in our town carries this along with several other after shaves and this one stands out.  </li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other Clubman scents but keep coming back to this one.</li>
<li> The Vanilla is the only other one that comes close.</li>
<li> Once you try this you will not go back to any other brand.</li>
<li> It does its job in preventing razor burns and any other shaving related blemishes.</li>
<li> I am trying each product for a day or two, independent of any other products just so I can get feel for each one.</li>
<li> If you work construction or some other physical job, this is the product for you.</li>
<li> smell, however, is very strange.  </li>
<li> I follow up with some moisturizer once the aftershave dries, as the alcohol will dry out your skin.  </li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t feel overly \\&quot;alcoholy\\&quot; and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face afterwards.  </li>
<li> It can dry your skin because it contains alcohol</li>
<li> it leaves my face a bit dry</li>
<li> giving 4 starts because I feel that some times my skin seems to get dry after applying this after shave, may be it is just for me.</li>
<li> It also doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
<li> Nonetheless, it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin and doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
<li> But once you apply it to yourself and let it dry, the smell \\&quot;changes.\\&quot;</li>
<li> once it&#x27;s dry (you&#x27;ll get used to the smell</li>
<li> but but others will) is to let some of it spill on the bottle, let it dry then smell it.</li>
<li> I do like the feel of splashing this on my face, but it leaves my face feeling dry.  </li>
<li> I have been tring different old aftershaves lately.</li>
<li> Stronger than your average aftershave and long lasting.</li>
<li> I have to give it 4 stars because even though I liked it my wife hated it and said it made me smell like an old man.</li>
<li> Long lasting and mellows down as its on, never smelling like</li>
<li> Some believe that, and this is open for debate, that Chuck Norris cried one single tear in the distant past which was obviously the cause for the Big Bang.  </li>
<li> Those men who are 50 and older will know what I mean.  </li>
<li> I even developed a small rash in the corner of my lips.</li>
<li> My shave arsenal (John Allan&#x27;s Slick Water, Taylor of Old Bond Street Eton College cream, ToOBS \\&quot;Mr.</li>
<li> This is the first alcohol-based aftershave I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I am hopelessly addicted to</li>
<li> Unfortunately, I find it too sweet.</li>
<li> I use it about 1/2 and 1/2 with water or on a really wet face, otherwise I&#x27;d smell like grandpa Fester all day long.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s not a scent you&#x27;d use trolling for hotties; rather a scent that says, \\&quot;I&#x27;m an adult who is serious about my daily grooming routine.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> morning I woke up with ten extremely flexible women from Cirq-de-soliel in my bed!  </li>
<li> I was initially afraid of smelling like a 70 year old man, and if you use too much you will!  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if I want to smell like I just left the barber shop on a regular basis.  </li>
<li> I later moved on to British Sterling, Paco Rabanne, Pierre Cardin, Aramis, Bay Rhum, and Guerlain Vetiver (for the past 30 years)</li>
<li> This is one of those aftershaves that has the ability to flat out offend other people, so be careful with it.</li>
<li> This is a high quality after shave with subtle fragrance.</li>
<li> After a week of using this my skin became very dry and flaky.  </li>
<li> After trying this for a few days, I went back to my previous after shave and haven&#x27;t looked back.</li>
<li> Ever since I can remember, my barber dabs a little of this stuff on the back of the neck after a haircut.  </li>
<li> The scent can last a couple hours after application, but if that is not to your liking, you can apply a little water to rinse away the excess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Only lasts a little while though.</li>
<li> The smell is not so bad but it does remind me of the cheap lotion the barbers used way back in the Fifties.</li>
<li> Hysterical reviews aside, this is a great product.  </li>
<li> clubman pinaud brings back those long past days of barbershops.&lt;br /&gt;Falling</li>
<li> This aftershave is not what I expected.  </li>
<li> I smell like I just left a barber shop, everyday...</li>
<li> Sometimes I&#x27;ll apply it on with me with wet hands</li>
<li> As expected.  </li>
<li> : After a few weeks of use, my wife asked me \\&quot;are you using some different cologne?\\</li>
<li> I never really used aftershave</li>
<li> I am of the age to revert to the products my dad used in my youth, like it and DE wet</li>
<li> long-haul, there is absolutely no doubt that I would pick Clubman.</li>
<li> My oldest son started wet shaving using mystuff and loves this stuff.</li>
<li> His frat at college is now getting into wet shaving and Clubmam is theirfavorite aftershave.</li>
<li> A spicy and musky scent that goes well after a wet shave and lasts for a while.</li>
<li> I decided to try wet shaving with a safety razor.</li>
<li> But that&#x27;s to be expected from an aftershave.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m 21, so it&#x27;s not really a smell</li>
<li> Occasional images of the 6th grade gym coach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was starting to wonder if the smell was awakening long repressed and extremely uncomfortable childhood memories involving the gym coach, when it finally hit me.</li>
<li> I can see the idea of it (a glass bottle) slipping and breaking in the bathroom and the additional shipping due to weight however...</li>
<li> It&#x27;s classy yet subtle.  </li>
<li> A little goes a long way, so I put mine in a two ounce spray bottle</li>
<li> Use it in moderation; a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> All synthetic, nothing natural god forbid they use natural stuff, its too expensive, they rather put this mess on our skin</li>
<li> Seems that a little bit goes a long way.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not good at describing scents, but it smells like an old barber shop and my grandpa...</li>
<li> So I gave it 3 stars because other than the scent, everything else does what it should.</li>
<li> so be careful!</li>
<li> and I look forward to trying out some other scents.</li>
<li> Just like other reviews, the smell is just like a barbershop.</li>
<li> For the price each bottle costs I&#x27;ll be buying other sents to try out.</li>
<li> It definitely reminds me of the the barbershops of years past.  </li>
<li> care what the other guys on here say....</li>
<li> I plan on trying the other sents in due time.  </li>
<li> I decided to give it a go and bought some on a whim when ordering other stuff.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s recommended to only use a small amount</li>
<li> Depending on my mood, I used one or the other, so my comparison has been somewhat continuous.</li>
<li> Although its label says &amp;#34;with Aloe Vera&amp;#34;, its other ingredients are not listed.</li>
<li> but sometimes I have these small red pimples due to infection after shaving.  </li>
<li> It does smell like the essence of all other aftershaves.</li>
<li> /&gt;There are some side effects in using this product on a regular basis, the #1 being the excessive hordes of women that you will be fending off upon leaving your house each morning.</li>
<li> I was not aware of Clubman before I found this on Amazon.</li>
<li> She tells me that she prefers this to any other aftershave I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Heard that it burns a lot for other people though.</li>
<li> Was very curious to know what this \\&quot;barber shop\\&quot; scent everyone keeps referring to smelled like.</li>
<li> Even though it&#x27;s fairly heavy in alcohol, it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.  </li>
<li> you are tired of using Axe and smelling like you just came back from an encore performance of the last Justin Bieber concert</li>
<li> But clubman isn&#x27;t terrible its old school for sure.</li>
<li> (I shave every other day on average).  </li>
<li> This stuff smells EXACTLY like my barber shop and smells insanely manly, fresh, sharp, clean...you know the deal.</li>
<li> I bought the bottle locally and it isn&#x27;t at all hard to find.    </li>
<li> When running late for work with no chance of picking up coffee, slap this stuff on your face for hours of &amp;#34;Wheew Wheew!&amp;#34; Not to overpowering for people passing you by but the initial application wakes you up.</li>
<li> A bottle this size should last you a couple of months at least with semi-daily use.</li>
<li> but  it was too time consuming and the cost was not worth it.</li>
<li> agreed to come back at least twice a week.  </li>
<li> Hits your face like a hundred angry hornets and leaves you smelling like a real man.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not worth 4 stars.</li>
<li> You either love it or you hate it.</li>
<li> I wear button down pajamas.  </li>
<li> Memories of my grandfather walking me down the street, smelling his starched collar and Clubman aftershave on his chin.  </li>
<li> So put down that girly smelling bottle of Axe and pick up some Clubman.</li>
<li> When I sat down,.</li>
<li> down time......</li>
<li> After the burn dies down your face feels smoother than a mo&#x27;fo.</li>
<li> probably their other products as well!</li>
<li> /&gt;Though I will still test other after shave rubs, I know I can always return to Clubman!</li>
<li> * works on other cuts and bruises too !</li>
<li> Forget the other products that are geared towards making you smell like you just walked out of a mountain valley or you just got done climbing off the line as your air dried in the summer</li>
<li> The DE Safety razors are very sharp, and nicks now occur, were they were seldom on the duller toss aways.  </li>
<li> half was gone.</li>
<li> less so the bleeding.  </li>
<li> /&gt;The one star less is because of the bottle..</li>
<li> another half star for making me like it.</li>
<li> When I woke up in the morning I could still smell the scent ever so slightly.</li>
<li> Conan Doyle, Mark Twain, OHenry rolled out accompanied by the slight beer breath and the lingering Clubman.  </li>
<li> Seriously, the only way you could increase the sensation would be to use molten lead for aftershave.  </li>
<li> Apply after shaving will result in a slight burning/warming sensation</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re looking for a time-tested, classic scent you can&#x27;t go wrong here.  </li>
<li> and he makes quite a mess in the apartment.</li>
<li> My first experience with Pinaud was in the barber shop, when my barber used Pinaud talcum powder after cutting my hair.  </li>
<li> or less impossible to find in big box stores in the NYC area as far as I know.</li>
<li> feel.&lt;br /&gt;Get your game up and double down on the this aftershave and clubman talc.</li>
<li> so you won&#x27;t shatter it with a little drop.</li>
<li> and it mellows it out a little.</li>
<li> if admittedly a little \\&quot;grandpa-ish.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The scent is weak and does not last but an hour.</li>
<li> Stop using little boy after shaves.  </li>
<li> I bought it to help with the little knicks i get here and there, and then i started using every day.  </li>
<li> Then, I imagined him splashing a little Clubman on, hitting the slopes.</li>
<li> A little tingle when you slap it on</li>
<li> My skin ends up drying up just a little</li>
<li> so you&#x27;ll know where you were a little too aggressive.  </li>
<li> is stings a little and tones my face.  </li>
<li> The coolness of Proraso is minty and lingers a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The smells reminds me of trips to the old-school barber shop with my grandpa when I was a little kid</li>
<li> Unfortunately, the the fragrance does not last very long.  </li>
<li> It leaves the skin tight and firm and the smell is not overpowering.</li>
<li> If you put a little on your shoulders, behind your ears, and on your wrist you won&#x27;t need a separate cologne, and it will last all day.</li>
<li> Along with the missing sting is the missing after shave smell.  </li>
<li> Do your self a favor save a few bucks by getting these three and look forward to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers</li>
<li> I use this stuff on my head nearly everyday.  </li>
<li> but it still gave me a headache after a few hours.</li>
<li> Takes a few hours to wear off</li>
<li> It also does a nice job at staunching blood flow of those nasty nicks that happen from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> don&#x27;t believe in giving a product a poor review because it doesn&#x27;t meet a personal preference (for example scent or astringency in an after shave).</li>
<li> I wasted 8$.  </li>
<li> my face tends to get dried out though</li>
<li> product, doesn&#x27;t burn too heavily on skin</li>
<li> I have been wearing this for over thirty years and as an everyday after shave</li>
<li> An inexpensive everyday after shave.</li>
<li> I am not a huge fan of overly scented lotions.</li>
<li> In addition, it has the least bite or sting of any other after shave</li>
<li> Salved the burn from my double edged razor&#x27;s sting without the disgusting after tones from some \\&quot;designer\\&quot; fragrance named after streets in New York City, martial art moves or involving oceangoing vessels.  </li>
<li> no strong smell.&lt;br</li>
<li> I had stopped wearing after shave as my wife never liked anything I had tried previously.  </li>
<li> Every time I use it my skin feels tighter, I feel sanitary and the little woman lines it!</li>
<li> I mean irritating in the physical sense.</li>
<li> Way better than those awful body sprays marketed to my age group.</li>
<li> Maybe I have sensitive skin, but this stuff burns my face like crazy, even if I haven&#x27;t shaved.</li>
<li> I plan on alternating between this and my usual after shave which is made by Nivea</li>
<li> Frankly, that claim usually worries me a bit because who&#x27;s to say what &amp;#34;a man&amp;#34; smells like or if he smells &amp;#34;good&amp;#34;?</li>
<li> Not sure what the hype is about this product.</li>
<li> if not more.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not overwhelming</li>
<li> I&#x27;m 16, this isn&#x27;t usually what kids in my school smell like.</li>
<li> But don&#x27;t be an amateur and nick your self</li>
<li> You dont have to use alot, just a small ammount does the trick.</li>
<li> Maybe I&#x27;m a bit nostalgic for it, but I can&#x27;t get enough of this.&lt;br</li>
<li> :/</li>
<li> Small bottle.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure or convinced it helps sooth the skin after a shave.</li>
<li> Bottle though as usual is plastic</li>
<li> Was not able to return because it was flammable.</li>
<li> find this product very harsh on my skin.</li>
<li> im tired of all the other scents</li>
<li> I really like all of the scents from Clubman Pinaud&#x27;s line, but hate the alcohol, and harsh chemicals.</li>
<li> I mean is that the scent reminded me of when I was in my early 20s and lived with some roommates who were desperately looking for a mate.</li>
<li> Not like that stinky&lt;br /&gt;Axe and all that pretty boy foo foo stuff, spray on crap like hair spray is what Axe smell like.</li>
<li> This was a hard to find item I was looking for someone.</li>
<li> Hard to describe what it is, and I can&#x27;t do it justice.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard for me to describe the scent</li>
<li> , it makes it almost hard to apply on to your face without getting all over your hands and neck.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to say there is a difference between the two Clubman&#x27;s varieties.</li>
<li> I have continued to use it although it can be hard to find.</li>
<li> Not trendy.</li>
<li> Been using for at least 20 yrs.</li>
<li> Consistently late for work.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never had any negative comments about wearing it.</li>
<li> don&#x27;t plan on repurchasing this product, but thought I would at least give everyone else a warning that bottle is plastic and may not survive the shipping process.</li>
<li> /&gt;Lucky Tiger is the least astringent.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m practically forced to hold my breath until the smell goes away.</li>
<li> When I say man, I mean Jack Palance, Jack Lord.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not an *unpleasant* smell, but I&#x27;m left asking myself why I&#x27;d want to smell like this on purpose.</li>
<li> In this day and age, men&#x27;s fragrances are usually sold from behind glass at a department store, with scents that go from fruity to nutty to musky to whatever.  </li>
<li> There is nothing subtle about alcohol interacting with you shaved skin.</li>
<li> but seriously, she has grown to like it</li>
<li> Seriously, I read that</li>
<li> Not overpowering, but subtle - not flowerly, but a man&#x27;s scent.  </li>
<li> Seriously, there is nothing I have found that comes close.</li>
<li> At $4 a bottle its a joke if it wasn&#x27;t so serious.</li>
<li> There are subtle notes of A1 steak sauce and citrus.</li>
<li> The aroma is not overpowering and subtle, but lasts all day.</li>
<li> Sorry I like aftershave that has manly smell not sweet like others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
<li> I have a few of the clubman aftershaves as well as a hole host of expensive lines that go up to 150 bucks.</li>
<li> Not a good thing</li>
<li> I was worried about that, after having some awful aftershave moments when I started wet shaving and trying different stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Seriously, I am disappointed the scent doesn&#x27;t last on me longer than it</li>
<li> This is my second time buying this product, and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed.</li>
<li> this is very hard to find anywhere else and trust me</li>
<li> have a tough beard</li>
<li> I was not happy at all with this purchase</li>
<li> I cannot give legitimate feedback on the product itself because it was so poorly packaged that the bottle was broken sometime in transit.</li>
<li> Step up your game.</li>
<li> I was in line today at the supermarket and a woman behind me</li>
<li> Absolutely false.</li>
<li> After applying the aftershave I always apply cold water to close my pores, and that will leave my face feeling tight and uncomfortable.</li>
<li> But Pinaud also implies that this formula dates from 1810, and if you look up the fragrance ingredients a lot of them double as an insect repellent or even a remedy for lice or mites,</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m a little disappointed in that,</li>
<li> I was wrong.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, what they don&#x27;t tell you is that they&#x27;re out of supermodels -</li>
<li> This is a mans after shave, none of that silly flowery smell that the kids spray themselves with today.  </li>
<li> No need to use expensive colognes anymore.</li>
<li> and it just rubs me wrong.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, the scent is gone after 15 minutes, so I do not get the masses of women clawing all over me.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately I can&#x27;t find my after shaves.</li>
<li> but if you shave correctly- it will not be at all uncomfortable.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This after shave has been a classic for generations. The fragrance - still imported from France - is pleasing, and the lotion is altogether soothing!</li>
    <li> Smells good, does a good job of soothing the skin after a clean shave</li>
    <li> The smell is OK and it is very strong and it lasts several hours.  I will use the one I bought until it runs out but I will go back to my good old &amp;#34;skin bracer&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The smell of this reminds me of what my old man used to smell like. Yes I go to a barber shop and my wife is crazy about this stuff and how I smell after going to the baber. Pretty manly stuff here</li>
    <li> I could not stand the smell of this after shave lotion. More importantly, my wife hated it. This went in the trash after a couple of uses.</li>
    <li> smells and burns great</li>
    <li> I have officially graduated to manhood. It thought it was the moment that I got my first car or after my first time I was with a woman. I was wrong. It was the first time I slapped this stuff on my face. Got to love an aftershave that says flammable on the label. If Chuck Norris was to ever shave, this is the aftershave he would use.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several yearrs and love it.  I always smell like I just came out of the barber shop.</li>
    <li> Classic aftershave at a bargain price - it might be cheaper at wal mart if you can find it there, but I didn&#x27;t want to look for it.  This is one of the cheapest aftershaves I use, and it holds it own.  Sharp sting when first applied, so stay away if you don&#x27;t like that.  I love the sting.</li>
    <li> Always used stetson after shave. Now I&#x27;ll never go back. Very soothing scent and feel.</li>
    <li> A classic men&#x27;s scent, splash some on when you want to feel like you just got out from your barber&#x27;s shop and want to tackle the world-very old school in a good way.</li>
    <li> Husband loved it! but don&#x27;t last</li>
    <li> Completes the shaving experience and smells great.</li>
    <li> Clubman makes me skydive better.</li>
    <li> love this stuff easy on my face</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok I like a bay rum after shave better</li>
    <li> I got this product just to try it out. It has been around for years. I remember it from barbershop days. It is a wonderful scent that has many layers. A little goes a long way, so I put mine in a two ounce spray bottle so I can spray it on and then rub it in. Very nice end to a perfect shave.</li>
    <li> The glowing reviews about this after shave cannot be overstated. Whether for nostalgic reasons or just changing your style, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this. Smells like something a real man should smell like. Don&#x27;t be intimidated by the initial strength...it calms down quickly yet lasts until the evening if someone is very close to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve received a lot of compliments from women and men about the scent and I tell them straight up - it&#x27;s Pinaud&#x27;s Clubman. A classic.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it was an actual lotion but it&#x27;s the old school tonic type stuff. Still the after shave is good nonetheless. It leaves a very masculine classy scent and the chicks love it!</li>
    <li> This aftershave is not what I expected.  I think it has a decidedly feminine scent.  I can&#x27;t wear it and threw it away.  It  works for some but not for me.</li>
    <li> I used to have a problem with shaving. I just didn&#x27;t want to do it. I would have once every 2 weeks. Everybody kept asking me when I was going to shave. Then I bought this after shave. I enjoy the smell so much that I&#x27;m now shaving every 2-3 days. It was a very pleasing smell, though do watch out because it is strong! When applying, the alcohol rushes up my nose and I have to cough and catch my breath! I may not be manly enough for this product, but I&#x27;m trying! I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Reminds me of an old fashioned barbor shop. Very powdery smell not over powering thats kind of addicting. Will most likely always be an item next to my shaving supplies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shaving its like a double shot of expresso, wakes you up, numbs your face leaving it silky smoooth!</li>
    <li> Famous product used by barbers for over a century. Clean scent that will not be confused with foo-foo cologne. an excellent buy at this price for a large bottle.</li>
    <li> From my husband - at first he was reluctant to try to an &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; aftershave that came in a plastic bottle....turned out to be his favorite....much nicer scent and easier on sink than Hugo Boss, Pack Rabanne Million etc. (all of which he has)</li>
    <li> When running late for work with no chance of picking up coffee, slap this stuff on your face for hours of &amp;#34;Wheew Wheew!&amp;#34; Not to overpowering for people passing you by but the initial application wakes you up. I love this stuff and look forward to trying other Pinaud products.</li>
    <li> This aftershave is very strong. I smell it throughout the day while at work. Fortunately i like it. My wife says it&#x27;s to musky... i think it carries the right amount of musk. It reminds me of a classic barber shop. Fresh and clean. It also makes me skin feel smooth and powdery. It&#x27;s no wonder to me that this recipe of aftershave as stood the test of time. Head on over to your local CVS and pick up a bottle. You&#x27;ll be happy you did!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this aftershave and I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on being the best smelling dude around. Absolutely love it, its the best part of my shave in the morning.</li>
    <li> The face very nicely firmed and toned with this splash. Guys with acne, I strongly suggest this to you, the scennt is lasting and very fresh, a typial vanilla spice old barber stuff</li>
    <li> It shipped fast in early in the product smells great even if you don&#x27;t shave every day just a little splash in the morning before to work it&#x27;s awesome in the sent last all day awesome product</li>
    <li> Manly scent.  Good aftershave that tightens the pores.</li>
    <li> I received my product today for my husband&#x27;s christmas gift.  After reading all of the awesome reviews I knew he&#x27;d love this aftershave.  Upon receiving the product I noticed the smell, love it! Hated why I smelled it before opening and that was because it leaked most of it&#x27;s contents while in the shipping process.  Very disappointing that I can&#x27;t wrap my husbands gift because it looks like it&#x27;s already been used.</li>
    <li> Alcohol based;&lt;BR&gt;This stuff WILL wake you up in the morning!&lt;BR&gt;There is nothing subtle about alcohol interacting with you shaved skin. This will open your eyes!!!!&lt;BR&gt;The fragance is classic and you&#x27;ll feel you are celebrating V-E day, or just smell like your grandfather did!!!&lt;BR&gt;This is a man&#x27;s aftershave, you&#x27;ll be reminded of better days of past, when your pappy took you to the barber shop, and those old barbers that told war stories, cut your hair with real scissors and blade.</li>
    <li> i wanted to smell like i was at the barber shop with paying the barber. its great and my girlfriend loves the light citrus and lavendar smell. oh and i love it too.</li>
    <li> Not bad.  I was initially afraid of smelling like a 70 year old man, and if you use too much you will!  I use it fairly sparingly and actually only use on half my face while I use Proraso refresh on the other half so I&#x27;m not too &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; on any one smell.</li>
    <li> Great scent...get many comments from women that like the smell.  After a classic shave with my double edge razor a few splashes of this and I feel like a manly man!</li>
    <li> In this day and age, men&#x27;s fragrances are usually sold from behind glass at a department store, with scents that go from fruity to nutty to musky to whatever.  But there&#x27;s something about Clubman aftershave that makes me forget about unisex hair salons and makes me think of a barber shop (complete with the red and blue pole outside, sitting and reading papers and magazines until your turn in the chair comes up, and the sound of snipping scissors and the smalltalk you get from your barber.  It&#x27;s fresh and clean, and doesn&#x27;t cost $40 and up.</li>
    <li> It does take you back to when a barber shop was a barber shop.  A good close shave resulted in a great smelling splash and everyone knew that you were clean shaven. It will bring back memories and the ladies do notice, though the comments are a side benefit. A clean feel on the face and a confidence in your step. That is not too bad for the price.</li>
    <li> Want to smell good?  This does the trick.  Combined with Clubman talc it makes a complete after bath freshner.</li>
    <li> I am 22-years-old and I love this stuff. I first heard about it from the Art of Manliness blog and decided to check it out. It smells great. Manly. There is a citrus-like smell to it. Way better than those awful body sprays marketed to my age group. Gives you confidence and makes you feel more dignified; almost puts a bounce in your step. There is a fear among young guys of using fragrances of yesteryear, the &amp;#34;I&#x27;d smell like an old man&amp;#34; mentality.  This shouldn&#x27;t worry you. A real woman is attracted to the smell of a real man. I&#x27;ve received nothing but positive feedback since I started using it. Use it in moderation; a little goes a long way. A bottle this size should last you a couple of months at least with semi-daily use.</li>
    <li> I kept wondering: Am I truly a man?  I&#x27;m told to buy this stuff called Axe.  I buy it.  I smelled like a boy who still lived with his parents.  Were females attracted to me?  Yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After they came back from their Justin Bieber concerts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 38, so that was a bit untidy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a 3 Wolf Moon shirt.  Unfortunately, what they don&#x27;t tell you is that they&#x27;re out of supermodels - too many shirts have been sold.  The supermodels that broke up with their boyfriends as their shirts wore out heard about Dwight on The Office.  Not only is he famous, but he proudly wears 3 Wolf Moon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to try Clubman After Shave Lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m truly a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I smell like I just came out of a barbershop.  It&#x27;s delicious.  Not too strong.  Smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;m now a man.  I do worry a little about smelling like an old man, and perhaps I have gone from 13 year old girls to women who are 6x better: 78 year olds.  Maybe I&#x27;m not man enough for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11/29/2014 UPDATE:  I am now 42.  They are now 82.</li>
    <li> This has a very strong and refreshing scent. It feels very nice and I enjoy the retro scent. It is quite strong, just a little bit will wake you up in the morning.</li>
    <li> Classic, cool, crisp scent. Old school barber shop feel.&lt;br /&gt;Get your game up and double down on the this aftershave and clubman talc.</li>
    <li> I wanted to give this a try after seeing all the good reviews. I should of paid attention to the reviews that said it smells like old man. Because it does. Those looking for a old school aftershave, this is it. But be aware that you will have an old man scent.  The scent lingers on for a good amount of time. Not overwheaing but it does hang out for quite a while. So I gave it 3 stars because other than the scent, everything else does what it should. I&#x27;m trying to like it but as soon as a get a wiff of it, reminds me of someone&#x27;s grandfather. Oh well.    Update  My wife said I smell like an old man dead in a casket. LOL   Giving this to my father in law. I think he uses this.</li>
    <li> As an eighteen year old in high school i smell lots kids wearing Axe&#x27;s latest aerosol \\&quot;cologne\\&quot;. Personally i cannot stand the smell of these. Instead i would like to smell like a true man, like i remember my grandfather smelling. This timeless barbershop smell creates just that smell and is even better when paired with [[ASIN:B0007MW2ZW Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl, 5.3-Ounce]]</li>
    <li> Very classic smell. My only concern is that it has a strong scent and can be easily over applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Good old style after shave. I love the way it feels on my face but the scent is a little heavy for me. Old style barbershop smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 31 years old and I like this aftershave quite a bit it has a masculine but powdery scent. Smells classy and classic without making me smell like an old man! Had to give this one 4 stars though because I like the classic vanilla much more than the original.! For the $ heck buy both!</li>
    <li> Tried this for the first time...I put this on my face despite a cut on my face (which was my fault) and it didn&#x27;t even sting even though it had alcohol!!  Impressed with it so far...love the old school barbershop smell...now I&#x27;ll just see how long the scent will last on my face..</li>
    <li> Just like when i got my hair cut as a child. Brought back a lot of memories! Very nice product.</li>
    <li> I started cutting my own hair after going to a barber for 20 years that used the original Pinaud. So I bought my own and ahhhhh.... I love it! A great, nostalgic scent and a pleasant sting as it tightens up your skin. The smell is not overpowering but I notice it lasts a LONG time, which I like. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> At first was not to impressed,  I mean smells good, but how to impress the ladies smelling like my dad? Then my mom \\&quot;kindly\\&quot; reminded me that my dad had 11 children by 4 diffrent women, and yet never faulted in any one of his obligations. So yeah i think i like it a little more now plustons of comps from the girls in my life.</li>
    <li> Item was as decribed, and nice pleasant smell</li>
    <li> This is the quintessential &#x27;man&#x27; scent. Barbershops, old vets, razor blades and Clubman. I bought the bottle locally and it isn&#x27;t at all hard to find.    It has a pleasant fragrance with touches of vanilla and musk. It is alcohol-based, and is a brisk follow-up after shaving and giving your face a cold water rinse. It can be pretty powerful when first applied but backs off quickly. I find that a trace of the scent lingers into the evening (which is fine with me as I don&#x27;t wear cologne). I am not a fan of colognes or bottled smells but I love this product.</li>
    <li> I had not really heard of Clubman until I had to order my father some of their hair gel here on Amazon and tried a container of it and liked it myself.  When I had to re-order the hair gel this came up as a recommendation and I thought, &amp;#34;A $5 aftershave? That can&#x27;t be good!&amp;#34;  But, it was $5 so I added it to the cart not expecting much.  When it arrived I immediately had to try it, which was fun since it was about -10F here in Chicago that day and the stuff was ice cold but once the initial alcohol harshness wore off I was immediately transported to the barber shop.  There is an unmistakably scent here that smells just like the barber shop I&#x27;ve gone to as a kid and overall I really liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess the true test was asking my wife for her opinion and it was a positive one.  If you&#x27;re looking for a time-tested, classic scent you can&#x27;t go wrong here.  It&#x27;s a nice scent and has a better lasting power than most other aftershave lotions that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it may be old-fashioned but it&#x27;s also good stuff.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> This stuff is intensely scented, so much so that my girlfriend really, and I mean really, dislikes it.  As a classic \\&quot;drugstore\\&quot; type product, it is decent.  For those who love a strong scent and aren&#x27;t deterred by alcohol based products, you&#x27;ll enjoy it.  As for me, I&#x27;ll choose to not use!</li>
    <li> I went looking for old style colognes at Walgreen&#x27;s.  I figured that a 200 year old product qualified.  I immediately splashed some on in the car and was hooked.      Now, it definitely is old school, it will make you think of what the original barber shops would use.  It is not for sissies, this is a man&#x27;s after shave.  Do not expect any citrus scent, it is straight up masculine.      I can see how some may not like it but, if you know what to expect before hand, it will help you with this purchase.  Go for it! You are not spending much to try something that brings back memories of times gone by.  You can carry the torch of manliness on to the next generation.</li>
    <li> I myself love classic barber shop scents. And this is the best.Not like that stinky&lt;br /&gt;Axe and all that pretty boy foo foo stuff, spray on crap like hair spray is what Axe smell like. Aftershave is supposed to be a splash on manly scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont think it smell like old man/grandfather. This wasnt as widely used back in the day as Old Spice and Brut, those are more grandfather type. This stuff smells amazing. And so what if it does smell like your grandfather, he was probably more man than u little young ones today</li>
    <li> I was not happy at all with this purchase I order this bottle of After shave. When I received it  the bottle  had been open half was gone. The mailman put a bag around it and a rubberband to hold it together.  I would of sent it back but  it was too time consuming and the cost was not worth it. I will not be ordering from this company again... Let me say it&#x27;s not the product it&#x27;s the way is was package very poorly</li>
    <li> Tried this out. Smell is okay, but dried my face out and didn&#x27;t take care of razor burn. Will stick to my Nivea sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Wow. This stuff is strong. You can really feel the burn. I use this at night before bed and in the mornings, the scent lingers but is mostly gone (thankfully). I would never want to wear this right before work since some people may complain. When I apply it on my upper lip area, I have to be in front of a fan or moving around. A full whiff of this will take your breath away. The smell is pretty nice but I can&#x27;t get it out of my head that it kind of smells like a mix of shaving cream and sun tan lotion. Still manly though. The bottle is plastic so you won&#x27;t shatter it with a little drop. Since it&#x27;s a liquid I end up wasting a lot that just falls out of my hands and whatnot. This seems to not really be a big issue though. I seem to be going through it at an acceptable rate in my opinion. My estimate would be a bottle every 2 months.</li>
    <li> Do it. Smell like your grandfather. You probably wouldn&#x27;t be here if he didn&#x27;t smell the way he did.</li>
    <li> Very old-school scent. Reminds me of barbers of the old days. It&#x27;s not cloying and overpowering like a lot of today&#x27;s scents. Very much of the less-is-more era. It feels great in the morning and it has a nice scent that lasts through the morning.</li>
    <li> My favorite alcohol based splash on with a strong masculine scent.  To me it smells like a barber shop from the 1970s/80s--in a good way. The scent fades away after an hour or two. Even if you shave every day this bottle will last you a couple of months.</li>
    <li> Aftershave arrived as promised and is awesome....I smell like I just left a barber shop, everyday...I will by more when this is gone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m totally done with moisturizing balms that are overpriced. I&#x27;m done with fancy aftershaves and things like that. Stick to the basics -- there&#x27;s a reason most barbers use this stuff. It&#x27;s great. A good clean smell, without being overpowering or cloying. It&#x27;s refreshing, and a good value.</li>
    <li> Smells OK. The best of the line</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t be a dapper gentleman without this!</li>
    <li> Just a classic aftershave.  Something a perfect the &amp;#34;old way&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Imagine root beer laced with rubbing alcohol. There is a reason this aftershave is inexpensive, and it is not because someone made a mistake on the pricing.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product, great price, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Wife said she preferred an after shave that smelled like pot roast to this.    I thought it smelled manly, clean and helped the sting and bleeding after shaving pretty well...less so the bleeding.  But they sell something for when you absolutely must cut the heck out of your neck, or anyone elses.     I would buy again for sure, but will have to wait until wife has lost sense of smell.</li>
    <li> An aftershave that does its job as an astringent and antiseptic. Invigorates the skin after a close shave with a double edge or straight razor. The crowning jewel of a rewarding classical shave. Experience the luxury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Axe is for kids.The scent of Clubman is over 200 years old and is the signature of a gentleman. Not trendy. Not overbearing. The epitome of sophistication. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> My Girlfriend complained that I smelled too \\&quot;sanitized\\&quot; after I shaved because I used a touch of rubbing alcohol as my aftershave - don&#x27;t judge, it&#x27;s cheap and does the job well... :)  But she wanted me to smell &#x27;good&#x27;. I saw this product mentioned on The Art of Manliness website. I ordered it here, and it arrived this week. I tried it for the first time. My girlfriend loves the old school barbershop scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I want to smell like I just left the barber shop on a regular basis.  Maybe it will be good for every once and a while, but still not sure yet.</li>
    <li> Best damn aftershave ever with a great masculine fragrance (not cheap smell). I apply witch hazel after I shave and then apply pinaud a few minutes later and love this combination. If you want to upgrade your mancard BUY IT!</li>
    <li> I began using this aftershave when I began shaving with a straight razor.  To me, it&#x27;s part an overall theme... remembering days of old (although I&#x27;m only 31).  The scent of this aftershave is great, and the alcohol provides a great antiseptic quality that kills any bacteria that may be left from the shave.  I follow up with some moisturizer once the aftershave dries, as the alcohol will dry out your skin.  The vanilla scent is also very nice... does not really smell of vanilla at all.</li>
    <li> THIS AFTERSHAVE IS GREAT, LASTS A LONG TIME, EVEN IF I START TO SWEAT MY FACE WILLO NOT BURN UNTIL THE END OF THE DAY, LAST AMOST THE WHOLE DAY</li>
    <li> Works well as an aftershave but scents are almost always personal preference. I don&#x27;t like this scent but I think others might. It&#x27;s a very old fashion scent. This aftershave is a great value and if you like the scent I think this may be for you. It has a bit heavier face feel than I like. I prefer Captain&#x27;s Choice aftershaves or Fine aftershaves.</li>
    <li> another product I have used for many years, was alway a favorite at the barber shop.  I appreciate the smaller opening at the top so it does not dispense more than needed.</li>
    <li> Good product. Smells strong tho</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff. I highly suggest this to anyone looking for a new after shave, whether you are a beginner or just feeling daring. The smell is very masculine but not so heavy as to burn your nose hairs out.</li>
    <li> It may burn a little but it is worth it.  I mean if you want to be the best smelling man in town then you need The Clubman</li>
    <li> There is too much alcohol in it. The smell is not so bad but it does remind me of the cheap lotion the barbers used way back in the Fifties.</li>
    <li> This is a good aftershave for a man.  Smells like the good old fashioned type manly smell  from the corner barbershop.  Great value for product.  Good refreshing feel after a shave.  Scent is there but not over powering and not like the AXE type smells that can hit you like a tazer gun.  I don&#x27;t like colones and prefer the more subtle aftershaves.  If I wish to refresh a bit at lunch or before going out in the evening, this will do the trick.</li>
    <li> Great aftershave! Classic scent that I personally love (age 24). I like this more than Old Spice and this price is better than my local CVS!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great and it truly soothes the skin.</li>
    <li> It smells nice, but can be overpowering unlike the vanilla. If you use too much it&#x27;s akin to sunscreen so be careful!</li>
    <li> This thing burns away anything leftover in your face after you shave. Dang!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, overall a great aftershave. Very potent in both burning and smell.  It smells good, I like it, but I would prefer it was a little less strong.. my wife complains about how strong the smell is, but after 5 mins it&#x27;s ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the burning sensation, you can lower it a bit by spashing water or witch hazel before the after shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one star less is because of the bottle.. it&#x27;s made of plastic (ok, cheaper) and it doesn&#x27;t travel well.  It will always leak in your luggage on the plane. I started taking it in a separate ziplock but that cause too much liquid to be lost, so I&#x27;m not taking it on my trips anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall recommend. You can use it with a badge of honor!</li>
    <li> Smells like History. Go ahead be Oscar Wilde.</li>
    <li> Just the right amount of sting after shaving my face and my head. Skin feels tingly and conditioned. Great old time barbershop smell, reminds me of my dad&#x27;s WW2 generation who went on to work office jobs after the war but still smelled manly, not effeminate like subsequent generations. Will introduce it to my 14 yo son who just started shaving.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m someone who shaves every day, sometimes twice daily. I&#x27;ve used virtually every product out there, shaving creams, after shaves, etc. Once I used this product, my shaving experience was complete. I will never again use anything else. This product is better than $60 bottles of aftershave produced by cologne companies - this stuff smells great, feels excellent, and all of my lady friends love it. It seems to compliment every cologne I use, and lasts forever (longer than my colognes in some cases!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Never again will I use anything else. Buy it, you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> what can i say this is the best aftershave out there your woman will love it and beg to shave daily.fast shipping great packaging.if you are looking for the barbershop scent here it is</li>
    <li> Maybe I have sensitive skin, but this stuff burns my face like crazy, even if I haven&#x27;t shaved. I did like the smell, and the cool bottle. I gave it to my son so he could smell like an elderly gentleman, not like Axe. LOL. Plus, it got all up in my beard and on my fingers and made everything I drank taste funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s just me. I never thot I had sensitive skin, tho.</li>
    <li> This was a hard to find item I was looking for someone. Delivery was prompt.</li>
    <li> love the smell, masculine scent smells like a barbershop, great product, fast shipping, good price</li>
    <li> This Clubman after shave works great for closing up nicks. I was worried the smell would be over powering but after repeatedly asking my wife it if was too much she assured me it wasn&#x27;t. It has a nice masculine scent and I look forward to trying out some other scents.</li>
    <li> Just like other reviews, the smell is just like a barbershop. My wife likes the smell and I received many complements.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a bad aftershave, it does what it is meant to.&lt;br /&gt;THIS WILL WAKE YOU UP WITH THE BURNING ALCOHOL FEEL OF A THOUSAND DEMONS.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had known how strong it was, but that&#x27;s my fault for not reading the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is... ok. vanilla/manly smell. My girl doesn&#x27;t like it. I&#x27;d get something with no alcohol next time.</li>
    <li> Every shaver must try it. It reminds me with the Eighties when I was less than 5 years old. one more thing, it leaves a touch like a powder on the skin with smooooooth touch.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not an old guy.  Or a guy at all.  But I know how they smell, having had a father, grandfather and now a husband in my life, as well as sons.  Sometimes it&#x27;s not that great, to be honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, I remember this smell SO well from my childhood, worn by all of my favorite men.  My oldest son is just 20 and he wanted something different from what everyone else wears, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  He LOVES it!  Everyone around him asks him what he&#x27;s wearing.  It&#x27;s not at all overpowering, it just has a nice, clean, fresh scent that stays throughout the day.  The price is outstanding and it&#x27;s something he can wear at any age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it so much I am going to get some for my husband as well.  I wish they made the equivalent for women.  Except women shouldn&#x27;t be shaving their faces and if they are, they have a lot more to worry about than aftershave.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance. It burns but then I like the sensation after the shave.</li>
    <li> Today most men get their hair cut in places with the words Uni or Clips in their names. But if you grew up in a certain era, you got your haircut by a guy named Louie in a barber shop with three or four big stuffed waiting chairs and a table full of old Field and Stream magazines. Clubman is the memory of that barber shop in a bottle. It is a clean scent with no musk or flowers or citrus. And given that today most men wear aftershaves with ingredients like Patchouli and Ylang Ylang, Clubman becomes a unique smell that no one will find too overpowering.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quite nice- I like it, and I don&#x27;t like most scents.  It&#x27;s hard to describe a scent, really, but spicy and astrignent would be how I would describe Clubman.  Lovely earthy tones mixed with a barber shop scent.  Alas, it gave me a headache, as most aftershaves do, and has been given to a friend, who absolutely loves it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in my attempt to bring back the smell of the old Barber Shops that were around when I was a small boy.  This and Bay Rum are the REAL DEAL.</li>
    <li> my wife says it smells like a cross between gasoline and baby powder.  but seriously, she has grown to like it and it is a very classic barbershop scent</li>
    <li> I am a woman who loves the smell of Clubman Aftershave. No, I don&#x27;t wear it, but I buy it, and I know of no other aftershave that smells as delicious as Clubman.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality after shave with subtle fragrance. I have been searching for something like this for years. Hard to describe what it is, and I can&#x27;t do it justice. Not a loud, polarizing, aggressive cologne scent. You can splash on any quantity and it seems to settle to a just-perceptible level within 10 minutes. It doesn&#x27;t seem to clash with any cologne. It is mature but not &amp;#34;old man&amp;#34;. It is much more complex and refined than aqua velva or similar by-the-gallon, sanitizer after shaves. It is not as fruity and obnoxious as old spice. I would agree with the &#x27;timeless&#x27; characterization. Just think CEO after a shave at the country club, silk suit, and Rolex. Everyone seems to like it. Will purchase over and over.</li>
    <li> I got a bottle of this for christmas, as it was on my wish list.  I really like it.  The scent takes me back to the barber shop my dad used to take me to as a kid.  It is fresh, clean, sort of powdery smell.  It&#x27;s a light scent that stays with you for a while.  It certainly isn&#x27;t overpowering.  It just has a fresh sort of feel.  Now, depending upon your shave, it can have a bit of a sting.  If you had an irritating shave, it will sting a bit more.  But, I like the sting.  This has become on of my favorite aftershaves.  I have enough variety for each day of the week and this has become my Friday aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Another fabulous product from Clubman Pinaud. For the price each bottle costs I&#x27;ll be buying other sents to try out.</li>
    <li> I have a few of the clubman aftershaves as well as a hole host of expensive lines that go up to 150 bucks. Guess what I get the most compliments on when I wear them. Yup. The classic.  Been wearing this since I started to shave in the mid 80&#x27;s.  It is fresh, crisp, starts out sharp and then tones down to an almost baby powder smell and lasts a long time. It wakes me up and keeps me feeling clean. The perfect springtime / summertime aftershave.  Thanks Clubman.....ya cant argue with history.</li>
    <li> Great scent but seems to fade quickly.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even want to try it, I saw the ingredients and I decided I don&#x27;t want to put that next to my face... Also Amazon won&#x27;t allow me to return it.</li>
    <li> Picked this stuff up at Walgreen&#x27;s since I heard such good things. This stuff rocks! It smells great, and despite the alcohol content, no sting. I&#x27;ve worn Old Spice Fresh for years, and now I have a new favorite.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for over 30 years, I am glad people are still discovering it. If you like this, you should also try Pinuad Clubman Vanilla After Shave Lotion. I have tried a couple of their other scents and not enjoyed them, but I like the Classic Vanila almost as much as the Clubman, believe it or not. Just stumbled into it about a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you live in a warm climate, try their talk on a traditional horsehair neck duster in the summer. Mmmmmm. Now you&#x27;re talking barbershop!</li>
    <li> As others have said, this after shave feels as if all of the lesser demons of the abyss are flaying your flesh off, one centimeter at a time.  That being said, once the 15 second pain-cycle has ended, your face will feel clean and fresh.  I&#x27;ve been using this aftershave for a week straight and my skin feels smoother than it has in the past.</li>
    <li> Back in the 70s, my grandfather was a barber who only opened on Fridays and Saturdays ( he farmed the rest of the week). He only had one type of haircut but always used clubman in the end. I finally found it again and now put it in a spray bottle to use. I get more compliments now than when using all the expensive stuff.</li>
    <li> Have you ever smelled a citronella candle used to repel mosquitoes. If you have then you have smelled this aftershave. It does work well as an aftershave. This is a very popular aftershave that I really wanted to like but it is just not for my nose.</li>
    <li> last a long time, reminds me of barbershop, others think the smell is too strong, but i love it.</li>
    <li> More of a nostalgia item for me.  I like the way it smells because I like old school stuff and this is as old school as it gets.  It reminds of my grandpa after he was done shaving when I was growing up.  Not necessarily what I would where to impress girls though.  Burns a lot if you shave against the grain so I only use it for when I shave with the grain.</li>
    <li> I love this old school aftershave...wonderful scent and the alcohol will wake you up in the morning. Scent is a bit overpowering so use in moderation!</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband because is smell so good and he loved it every time he shave. I love every time he use this! &#x3D;0)</li>
    <li> If you work hard for your money don&#x27;t waste it on this cheap after shave. I spent $7.07 including tax, defiantly they make more than $6:00 profit. I will strongly recommend for an enemy, never to a friend.</li>
    <li> I was worried about the smell of this aftershave as I have never used it but was pleasantly surprised.  Its mellow, clean, and wears off well.</li>
    <li> Great old-school barber shop scent!  Burns a little, but totally worth it!</li>
    <li> Using the word &amp;#34;drydown&amp;#34; on 7 dollar aftershave is kinda funny, but I feel like that is the best part, truly. Pinaud Clubman was purchased off of rave reviews from Amazon buyers, so for the price I did the blind-buy. I&#x27;m happy I did. This can&#x27;t be beaten for the price! A 6oz bottle for 7 bucks. Wow. The bottle itself is plastic, but that&#x27;s what we get these days. The scent starts off very strong. A citrusy, musky, almost cheap smelling juice. I can&#x27;t really compare it with anything else. It stings the nostrils, as Will Ferrell says. But after about 15 minutes, it begins to drydown and settle down into a wonderful, manly, semi-refined smell that is highlighted by vanilla and the smell of babershop shaving cream. It&#x27;s mellow, classic and something very nice to smell. Others can smell it on you easily, so be cautious of the application amount. But do give this one a try if you like vanilla and Barbasol shaving cream put together. That may sound initially cheap, but it&#x27;s not. It truly is classy in the sense that you smell like a gentleman who just got cleaned up for a day with his gal. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to any guy, any age! The perfect aftershave experience!!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for the scent of an old-fashioned barber shop, this is it.  Not over-powering, but it is a scent that will get noticed.</li>
    <li> This may be labeled after shave, but with a generous splash or two on the neck and shoulders, etc., it makes a fine cologne that will last all day. After five or six hours it will fade to the sort of fragrance that Pinaud puts in its talc, but before that there&#x27;s a complex medley of soft, smooth, and very pleasant aromas that smell natural and masculine, but in a gentlemanly sort of way--it&#x27;s intended more for going to the opera than going out to the woods to hunt grizzly bears. I&#x27;ve tried a great many colognes over the years and am amazed that my two favorites end up being two of the cheapest, namely this and Pinaud&#x27;s Special Reserve, which IMO smells even better but doesn&#x27;t last quite as long. Forget about the reviews that claim this will make you smell like an old man--if you want to smell like a teenager, buy Axe, but if you want to smell like a grown man, try a classic scent that has been around longer than anyone alive today. I&#x27;ve had many compliments from many women while wearing it, and for me that counts for more than all the advertising money can buy.</li>
    <li> Good cheap aftershave. It&#x27;s hard for me to describe the scent but I like it.</li>
    <li> Not very effective, after shave you apply I feel good but not very concentrated and I think it is mild.</li>
    <li> Those of us who enjoyed a cool buzz cut or a flat top will appreciate this after shave lotion.  Salved the burn from my double edged razor&#x27;s sting without the disgusting after tones from some \\&quot;designer\\&quot; fragrance named after streets in New York City, martial art moves or involving oceangoing vessels.  Clubman Pinaud is the real deal and comes complete with memories of smoke filled upstairs barbershop, wrinkled leather chairs and barber honing a keen edge on his leather strop.  Thanks for the memories...</li>
    <li> Really Stingy and smells great. Its unique and imported! I put this on everytime after I shave and it is very nice.</li>
    <li> great product a nice scent my wife found this for me and says it smells great on me i will buy this product when needed</li>
    <li> Smells awesome--and the wife agrees! A spectacular and invigorating astringent, and the smell is straight from the most luxurious barber shop you can imagine. Y Chromosome in a bottle.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my BF after he had been looking everywhere for it. He says it feels amazing and he loves the smell. He says, its like real man. I will definately be buying more when he runs out.</li>
    <li> Nice classic smell, a bit strong for me but wiping with my damp towel brings it down to a reasonable level, for me anyway.</li>
    <li> After 56 years, I have finally been rewarded for being a man and the wait, as some of you see it, has been well worth it. In fact I really don&#x27;t see how anyone in their 20&#x27;s, or 30&#x27;s or even their 40&#x27;s should even be allowed to purchase this product. I know, I know - deep down you feel you&#x27;re old enough and ready for something as powerful as Clubman Pinaud After Shave Lotion - but you aren&#x27;t. Not until you&#x27;ve looked death squarely in the face, several times, and have been married long enough to understand there&#x27;s nothing really better, and not until you finally grow some real manners and stop dressing and acting like you just don&#x27;t give a damn. Well, I do give a damn and I&#x27;ve earned my right to wear Clubman Pinaud After Shave Lotion, and some you better grow a pair and start acting like you do, too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a classic smell, almost an old man smell. I guess since I&#x27;m getting old, I should start wearing this!</li>
    <li> I remember this smell from the barber shops of my childhood in the mid 60&#x27;s. Not overpowering, just a nice scent and feels great after a double edge shave. I will order more when this runs out!</li>
    <li> They should call this stuff Sex Panther! 60% of the time, it works every time!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for that Barbershop scent, this is it! I have tried numerous after shaves and this one is tops. Has just enough snap to it when you splash it on your face. I also can feel and see the difference. This is a mans after shave, none of that silly flowery smell that the kids spray themselves with today.  Beats out the over-priced after shaves easily. Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used after shave even after shaving for 40 years.  I read the reviews and decided to try Clubman Pinaud for myself.  I really like the fragrance and how it makes my face feel.  I agree with other reviewers, this is a very manly fragrance.  I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> This was bought for the senior resident facility I volunteer for.  The gentlemen like the scent.  I think the ladies do too!</li>
    <li> Very nice smell and does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I was extremely happy with this product.  It smells like a man should smell.  Forget the other products that are geared towards making you smell like you just walked out of a mountain valley or you just got done climbing off the line as your air dried in the summer breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;ll burn your face a tad if you shave like a maniac.  Take your time with a quality razor, soap, and brush and you will have a fantastic experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is that of the old school.  It&#x27;s classy yet subtle.  Not overpowering.  I&#x27;ve received nothing but compliments using this aftershave.</li>
    <li> All my life I always loved going to my dad&#x27;s barber. That powder they dusted your neck with was the best stuff in the world. Now I have once again found that scent, and I don&#x27;t even have to get my hair cut for it. This is a fantastic scent, I&#x27;ve heard some say it&#x27;s too strong and to cut it with witch hazel. I say Nay NAY! This stuff is perfect as is!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  The price is low but the quality is high.  Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> For the first couple days I knew a I had smelled this before.</li>
    <li> I like this aftershave. I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of good comments on it on how it smells on me. No need to use expensive colognes anymore. I just use this stuff. My grandpa use to use it. Now for some reason I&#x27;m using it. It&#x27;s a clean manly smell. Sometimes I&#x27;ll apply it on with me with wet hands and it mellows it out a little. Nice subtle smell. I would buy it again, which I have. It&#x27;s old school!</li>
    <li> This and the shaving cream make me look forward to shaving. Exceptional product.</li>
    <li> Another great smelling product from Clubman. Haven&#x27;t had any women try to jump me yet but in time I&#x27;m sure they will. One application lasts all day unless you sweat it off. I love shaving now because I splash this stuff on my face and ready to face the day.</li>
    <li> This smell reminds me of a fresh haircut that I got as a little boy at the local barber shop. There is nothing that feels and smells like Clubman Pinaud.</li>
    <li> This is a product that will last you for a long time, like many people have said, it is very strong so just a few drops will do it. As for the smell, it is some potent stuff, but once it airs out a little bit it leaves a very manly smell, one like in the old days. All in all, very pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Classic old school aftershave. Bravo Zulu to Clubman for not changing their formula in a day when so many are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very distince scent, but it doesn&#x27;t linger forever, just long enough. I&#x27;m not good at describing scents, but it smells like an old barber shop and my grandpa... Those are both good things, to me at least.. Hehehe.</li>
    <li> Men&#x27;s health did a puff piece on the good old days and the barber shops of my youth.  This splash on after-shave brought those memories back.  I found the talc in a CVS drug store.  Neither are expensive but both are memorable, all I need now is a bottle of Vitalis and a pack of Beeman&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This aftershave cologne is great.  It has a great scent and feels good when you spash it on.  It reminds me when i used to go to the barber.  Mostly all barbers use this brand.  Nice.</li>
    <li> Clubman is one of the classic afterhshaves used by barbers for generations. It is a fresh powdery scent. Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> After reading all of the reviews about how this is a real man scent, I was intrigued. I purchased it for my boyfriend and found it to be nothing more than a cheap smelling cologne you would buy at the grocery store. If you want your man to smell like a discount store then go for it.</li>
    <li> As expected.  Nothing more nothing less  Perfect for daily use.</li>
    <li> I read the wonderful reviews and so I went to my local CVS Pharmacy and picked up a bottle.  I tried it and waited for the results. The results are in and I&#x27;m not a fan.  Pinaud may smell good on some men just not me.  I&#x27;m gladly going back to my Proraso.  I really did hope to like the stuff because of the price and history…but even that couldn&#x27;t persuade me to use it one more time.  Cheers</li>
    <li> good product I like the original stronger scent better, but this is a good one too.  All Pinaud products are pretty good.</li>
    <li> I love this!  It has such a classic scent and it feel great on my face.  This have become my daily after shave!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very nice,  try it .&lt;br /&gt;The sweetness of the pudding is in the eating.</li>
    <li> Oh, what a manly classic smell. Reminds me of the good old days. Grab your top hat and best cane and make sure your lady has on her finest petticoat when you go out with this on your face. This smells nothing like your grandson&#x27;s flowery cologne that he probably bought at the mall for over $40. Nah, this stuff is manly and classic and only costs a few bucks. Folks will know that you are a real man who doesn&#x27;t go for that unisex girlie smelling cologne when they get a whiff of this. This will bring you back to the days when you walked out of the barber shop feeling like you were on top of the world after paying two bits for a shave and a haircut. Warning, your lady might get jealous with all the winks you will get from the gals in the malt shop.</li>
    <li> Works well for avoiding bumps and smells like America.</li>
    <li> Great smell, fantastic for the after gym.</li>
    <li> I recently got into wet shaving with DE razors so I bought this item based on the great reviews it received.  First I&#x27;d like to say this product is NOT a lotion as labeled on bottle and description. This product is a liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d also like to point ouy in my honest opinion this item is only receiving reviews based on nostalgia reasons and not because it&#x27;s an actual great product. I say this because there are far better products out there for post shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this product very harsh on my skin. After a week of using this my skin became very dry and flaky.  I even developed a small rash in the corner of my lips. I&#x27;ve never had sensitive skin or or a dry skin problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the smell goes, I did not find it to be too strong.  However I do find the smell nauseating.  It&#x27;s smells like liquid plastic!</li>
    <li> Caution! I am pretty sure they put some sort of inhale-able addictive substance in this product. I first sniffed it and it reminded me of the cheap Brut aftershave my mother put in my Christmas stocking as a little kid so I could smell &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;. This stuff has that same musky, strong, grandpa-in-the-barbershop smell. It is awful....and then it isn&#x27;t so awful...and then you kind of like it...and then you love it and you can&#x27;t get enough....and then you find yourself dabbing some on your 1 and 1/2 year old son so you can both smell manly together.&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty sure this is going to attract 50 year old women with daddy issues but I don&#x27;t care. I love it. Bathe me in this stuff and send me to the nearest senior center.&lt;br /&gt;Minus one half star for Clubman Pinaud making me me love smelling like an old man at a nightclub and another half star for making me like it.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect after shave. It has a classic,clean, masculine scent that lingers without being over powering. It&#x27;s also very affordable but it beats any other aftershave on the market at any price. If you are only going to use one aftershave for the rest of your life, this is the one you want. If you like having a variety of after shaves, you definitely want this one in your arsenal. It has a strangely familiar yet unique quality to it that is hard to explain but you know it when you try it because it gets the job done in every aspect you would hope for in an after shave.</li>
    <li> This is an oldtime scent that is clean and masculine and this lotion makes your skin feel great! I am not a metro guy...this is for me and the price is awesome! Will buy the larger bottle next time with free shipping for a better deal!</li>
    <li> This is nice, I ordered it off Amazon because everything in the store has so many ingredients.  So this is a simple mixture with some recognizable stuff and if you know this brand you&#x27;ll recognize the smell.</li>
    <li> Nice powdery scent, long lasting. If you like the masculine scent of an old time barber shop then you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK, but way too strong. Even a tiny drop makes my eyes water and burn from the smell. The powder is much better.</li>
    <li> If it&#x27;s the same stuff I used to buy at the barber shop when I was 14 or 15, this is the first aftershave I used,  As I recall it was a little sticky, but it smelled nice.  I later moved on to British Sterling, Paco Rabanne, Pierre Cardin, Aramis, Bay Rhum, and Guerlain Vetiver (for the past 30 years) (plus a Crabtree &amp; Evelyn one they don&#x27;t make anymore that had sandalwood in it).  Holy 1960s leave-it-on-the-long-side-even-if-my-dad-told-you-not-to-on-the-phone!</li>
    <li> Bottled Leonidas sweat</li>
    <li> Sure it&#x27;s old man after shave but back then men were men! They use this at my barber shop and I always loved the smell. Now I can smell like I was at the barber shop every time I shave. Success!</li>
    <li> I used this aftershave for the first time last night. There is alcohol, so you get a nice burn. The smell is ok, very old-school, but it lingers for an exceptionally long period of time. I shaved 3 hours before bed and it smelled as if I had just used the stuff when I put my head on the pillow. My wife made a comment also about how potent the smell was. When I woke up in the morning I could still smell the scent ever so slightly. It is now 1pm in the afternoon the next day and even with several hand washes today, my hand still smells like this aftershave. So, you have been warned.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best aftershave I&#x27;ve ever used. It would behoove you to believe the rest of the reviews, the positive ones that is. This aftershave will definitely wake you up. It definitely has an&amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; fragrance, but that&#x27;s not bad. A classic is always better to go with than something that&#x27;s an overpriced &amp;#34;flavor-of-the-month.&amp;#34; This is the kind of aftershave for a gentleman who is keenly aware of his sartorial taste and wants to put his best foot forward. The scent is strongest for the first hour or two, but I often place a small amount on later in the day if I&#x27;m going out. My skin is rather sensitive and, in spite of the &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; this has on my freshly shaven face, it soothes my sensitive skin very nicely. After only one bottle of Clubman Pinaud, I&#x27;m not even going to consider any other aftershave for a long, long time. One six ounce bottle has lasted me for several months, so it is a very economical buy as well. I can gladly give this product a solid five stars!</li>
    <li> I like the way it feels on my face, i hate the smell. very old man-ey. It reminds me of a smell my uncle always had as a kid and it just rubs me wrong.</li>
    <li> i use this product for over 35 years.  its just right .  no strong smell.&lt;br /&gt; feels great after a shave or out for a party. the&lt;br /&gt;  company and the years Pinaud  has been around over a 100 years&lt;br /&gt;speacks for it self.  no need for smelly body sprays . and costly after shaves$&lt;br /&gt;most time you just pay for the name..&lt;br /&gt;i use also other prouducts  from Pinaud&lt;br /&gt;item came fast.  well packed .</li>
    <li> Possibly the most manliest of manly aftershave lotion.&lt;br /&gt;There is none of this Justin Beiber Axe Bullcrap with this Clubman liquid gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burns like fire, so that you can fill women&#x27;s hearts with desire.</li>
    <li> Give you a real Kevin McCallister moment. Smells really good.</li>
    <li> It smells just like a barbershop. If you like that smell, this is for you; if you don&#x27;t like it you just might hate this.</li>
    <li> Like getting in a time machine and going back to an old school barber shop. Cheap, tames razor burn, fades to a powdery fragrances. Wish it was sold in a spray bottle.</li>
    <li> I very much like this scent. It&#x27;s in no way overpowering and reminds me of root beer, cola, and toothpaste.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really, really nice. It smells better than some of the more expensive colognes I own although it does not last very long. The fragrance is strong when you put it on but quickly fades (i&#x27;ve found others can smell it within around 30 minutes of putting it on). This is the only fragrance that I consistently receive compliments on and that has never happened with any other cologne/fragrance in my life. This stuff smells EXACTLY like my barber shop and smells insanely manly, fresh, sharp, clean...you know the deal. This stuff is a steal for what I paid (6 dollars and 50 cents) and I feel like a million bucks when I put it on. Worth every cent</li>
    <li> I decided to grab a bottle of this today at CVS after hearing so many great things about it. The scent is amazing and it truly reminds me of an old barber shop, as many have said. I dabbed some on my wrist and can&#x27;t stop smelling my own wrist! Every time I take a whiff it takes me back to the days of five dollar haircuts :)</li>
    <li> The minute you open the bottle for the first time and smell this stuff, you&#x27;ll feel like you stepped right into the old barber shop that your father took you to as a child. I switch back and forth between a straight razor, and a double-edged safety razor, and there&#x27;s no better way to finish off a classic shave, than with a healthy splash of Clubman. This is no after-shave &#x27;lotion&#x27;. This stuff burns the way you want your aftershave to! You know that it&#x27;s doing what it&#x27;s supposed to, and any razor burn you had will quickly be gone. No sissies here. This stuff is for men.</li>
    <li> It stings, it burns, but not too much - just enough to let you know that you are a man.  Doesn&#x27;t feel overly \\&quot;alcoholy\\&quot; and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face afterwards.  Nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent is great, if admittedly a little \\&quot;grandpa-ish.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: After a few weeks of use, my wife asked me \\&quot;are you using some different cologne?\\&quot;  I told her about the aftershave, and she made me get rid of it.  She told me it smelled \\&quot;like a stuffy old grandpa coat closet.\\&quot;  I still liked it.  But take it for what its worth.</li>
    <li> Ditch the sweet, feminine colognes, lotions, and aftershave gels.  Pick up your ax, eat your steak rare, and smell like a man.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed by this based on all the great reviews mainly because I built it up to be different.  I didn&#x27;t feel this was the most manly after shave I&#x27;ve smelt as people described but it has a very unique smell and the bottle seemed kind of small and cheap.  Overall this is a great after shave works well on skin and helping with after burn and cuts. I plan on alternating between this and my usual after shave which is made by Nivea is a creamy after shave which I really like.</li>
    <li> Old school scent I recall from the older men in my family. I wasn&#x27;t sure what my wife would think but she complimented me on the scent. The price is right so give it a go.</li>
    <li> This is a great old school scent. What does it smell like? The short answer is &amp;#34;barbershop&amp;#34;, as in you&#x27;ll smell like you do right after a haircut. This is because even many unisex salons typically finish a haircut with Pinaud&#x27;s talcum powder, and this has some of the same smell. More specifically, I can smell citrus oil (not so much lemon blossom or orange oil as citronella), and J&amp;J baby powder, plus there&#x27;s also a &amp;#34;bass note&amp;#34; that comes from tree moss, but I only really smell that separately in the bottle. I never disliked the scent but it took a day or two for me to really get used to it, and really love it. This is a strong smell by the way. If you put a little on your shoulders, behind your ears, and on your wrist you won&#x27;t need a separate cologne, and it will last all day. How does it work as an aftershave by the way? On me personally, its excellent (my skin is pretty sensitive but also a bit oily which is why I seem to get along well with &amp;#34;splash&amp;#34; aftershaves). I can definitely feel when I put it on, but it doesn&#x27;t sting... much. Some seem to think its quite strong in that regard, I don&#x27;t, I think its moderately strong. Once the slight sting subsides, it leaves my skin feeling very good (better than a lot of inexpensive aftershaves like Brut or Aqua Velva, specifically this leaves my skin soft and moist without feeling sticky), so I&#x27;m a fan in that regard. There are two other things that this product is famous for. 1, It&#x27;s supposed to make you &amp;#34;smell like a man&amp;#34;. This is the reason a lot of people say they use the stuff. Frankly, that claim usually worries me a bit because who&#x27;s to say what &amp;#34;a man&amp;#34; smells like or if he smells &amp;#34;good&amp;#34;? Seriously, I read that and I always worry I might be buying extra strength splash on B.O. Every once in a while a fragrance designer will screw up and actually do this. I&#x27;ve accidentally bought a deodorant that made me smell exactly like I just got out of an extra long gym class andFORGOT my deodorant. Anyway this smells &amp;#34;pleasant&amp;#34; and makes you smell &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; without being flowery, sweet, or fruity which is what I&#x27;m personally after. The second thing Pinaud is known for is making you smell, &amp;#34;like an old guy&amp;#34;. Is it popular with senior citizens? Sure. But Pinaud also implies that this formula dates from 1810, and if you look up the fragrance ingredients a lot of them double as an insect repellent or even a remedy for lice or mites, its likely that the formula really is around 200 years old, which means it was also probably popular with old guys when my grandfather&#x27;s grandfather was just a kid. It&#x27;s still around because its a classic. Oh and the best part is this stuff is extremely inexpensive and widely available. The price you see here is also the price you pay at your local Wal-Greens. So for $6 for around 6 oz you have a great, classic, distinctive scent, and a good quality aftershave that can double as your cologne. This stuff is a true bargain but I removed the word &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; from my review because while this is inexpensive, not &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; as either a fragrance or an aftershave. It works great, and smells great. This is not my absolute favorite fragrance (Muelhen&#x27;s 4711 is my very favorite), and its not my very favorite Pinaud product (I like the Vanilla Clubman even better) but I love this stuff and I also love the fact that its readily available in any drug store or supermarket, which made it my personal go-to for a while. However its fallen off that list of late because there is one problem with a distinctive unusual aftershave that&#x27;s strong smelling enough to double as a cologne: it s a jealous master that will fight any actual cologne you may want to wear. When I decided spray on colognes were generally easier and more convenient than having my splash-on aftershave pull double duty, ended up using the regular clubman a lot less often. For this reason I&#x27;ve subsequently deducted a star as well. If youwant to smell like this alone, it would be five stars. Although this works fantastically as an aftershave, and I&#x27;ll probably never be without a bottle, this is definitely below 4711 Aftershave and Pinaud&#x27;s Vanilla Clubman for me personally now, because they do a better job of letting my spray cologne (usually Azzaro Pour Homme or Cerruti 1881) do its job.</li>
    <li> This stuff tones my face and scalp really well after I shave. It can dry your skin because it contains alcohol but it smells great. After I apply it I go back over my face with a hydrating face lotion made by Lo&#x27;real. Then I lightly apply some more Clubman Pinaud.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been sold for 200 years and is still being sold today. A timeless fragrance. Relatively inexpensive, too! A good buy!</li>
    <li> After reading the mound of &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; reviews here, I went ahead and ordered one. I was truly excited while shaving this morning, ready to try this on. But I must admit that after I tried this on I was disappointed, and so was the wife, who promptly told me it smelled like a babies bottom. I have to agree with another reviewer who said it smelled a bit feminine, and I wish I had listened to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it does seem to remind me of the barber shop days, but no where near does it make me say &amp;#34;I&#x27;m truly a man.&amp;#34; - By Dr. StrangeBrew &amp;#34;marekjjones&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> There are a lot of humorous reviews of this aftershave, but this one is going to be more serious. I never really used aftershave but I decided to buy some when I bought my first double-edge razor. It just seemed like the thing to do. When it arrived and I tried it, I immediately remembered going to the barber on Saturday morning with my dad and then going out to Steak &amp; Egg for breakfast. I could literally see my old barbershop from 25+ years ago. It was pretty surreal. I had no idea the scent would be so linked to my past, but I&#x27;ve really enjoyed wearing it. As an added bonus, my girlfriend actually likes it!</li>
    <li> good aftershave here. Not a lot of burn, and it really does have a great smell. Sort of smells like a barber shop (in a good way). Pair it with Tailor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood shaving soap and go ahead and find a nice big stick to fight off all those ladies with.</li>
    <li> Not sure what the hype is about this product. It does not last very long and has a very sweet smell that is kind of overwhelming and not pleasant. Will stick to my Old Spice.</li>
    <li> So, I tried it the first time this morning and there was no hurtful stinging on my tender skin, I found that it would be okay for me as the sting was almost missing.  Along with the missing sting is the missing after shave smell.  I didn&#x27;t detect any odor at all and I had all my nose hairs clipped.  The essences are from France and &amp;#34;made in the USA&amp;#34; is on the plastic bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, it is cheap insofar as cost goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would make a nice Xmas gift for the man in your life but he might try to re-gift it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank God it doesn&#x27;t smell like BRUT.  A kid in the neighborhood had been led astray by using Brut and I could smell his coming two blocks away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have on order the Bay Rum rendition so I might bore you all again!</li>
    <li> I am a man.  And at 35, a seemingly old man.  I shave with a straight razor.  I wear button down pajamas.  I don&#x27;t like the idea of organic food or kids on my lawn.  And damned if I don&#x27;t love this aftershave.  Take a hike old Spice.  Clubman Pinaud is the new old man standard.  Kicks like cheap whiskey though.</li>
    <li> Now, I&#x27;m not a young guy. I&#x27;ve got more than my share of gray hair already, but this stuff... this stuff just smells like old man. I couldn&#x27;t even comment on the skin care performance because it never hit my face. I opened it, put 2 drops on my palm, and couldn&#x27;t go through with it. I washed my hands twice, then I double-bagged the bottle and carried it outside to the neighbor&#x27;s trash can.</li>
    <li> I bought this to compliment the Clubman Powder that I wear, It makes you smell like you just stepped out of the Barber Shop!</li>
    <li> Use that sharp blade in your DE old school razor. Brush on that old school shaving soap with the perfect brush. When your done, slap on the Clubman!  Now you have shaved like a man and smell like one too.  This is a great product with the barbershop smell.  Bring back some old memories when your dad took you to the barbershop for that burr cut and you watched all the men being shaved by the barbers.  Then the Clubman was applied with vigor and that smell has stuck with you since then. Make some memories with your own son!</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I wantd to be reminded of the old barber shops. It is the same stuff I used to get with a shave and haircut. Lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Great after shave;  might be the original for all I know.  Has a nice light fragrance, dies away quickly and won&#x27;t complete if you plan to wear cologne afterward.</li>
    <li> Great smell, works as expected to ease irritation and cool the skin.  And I also saw it sold at my local drugstore.</li>
    <li> Clubman Pinaud is an old school, old time barbershop, after shave/cologne. It is unmistakably masculine and has a distinctive scent of its own. When I wear it, as I do and have regularly, I get many compliments from the female persuasion on its appealing scent. This is not the &#x27;modern&#x27; scent which many times cannot be distinguished as either men&#x27;s cologne or women&#x27;s perfume. This truly harkens back to a time of &#x27;the Gentleman&#x27; and the scent which accompanies that time. When splashing it on it invigorates you after shaving and has a sauve, gentlemanly, scent all of its own. Been using for at least 20 yrs. if not more. Try it, you will be impressed!</li>
    <li> I bought several different kinds of Pinaud aftershave and cologne, and some Lucky tiger when i stated shaving with my old Gellette razors again, Wanted that old time Barber smell from my youth, and I was not disappointed, Would recommend</li>
    <li> First,&lt;br /&gt;I am a 23 y/o man who is well beyond the middle school days of bombing the locker room with axe body spray. I have had very sensitive skin shaving for as long as I can remember to the point that I really only shaved once every third day or so and only with the grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across this after shave after comparing prices with the art of shaving products which In fact are great products but ridiculously over priced. I was looking for a good masculine scent that also provided relief from razor nicks/burn as well as closed your pores. After seeing this stuff and realizing how long this company had been in business and seeing the reviews I said what the hell let&#x27;s try it. Bottom of the line it is a GREAT aftershave and I find it actually really cuts down on razor burn/nicks. The scent took me a day or two to get used too but I grew to really liking it. Best comparison would be to talcum powder smell, like you left straight from the barber shop. You smell like a MAN not a tween that took a bath in cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product, and I can honestly say it will last up a super long time but when it&#x27;s out I will be repurchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I use this product in combination with proraso shaving cream/badger brush, as well as a styptic pen for nicks. Do your self a favor save a few bucks by getting these three and look forward to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers</li>
    <li> This lotion met my highest expectations.  It is a great skin bracer after shaving and has a light scent matching Pinaud talc.  I recommend this product for anyone looking to replace strong and overpowering colognes.</li>
    <li> i love the scent of this. its a classic smell. im tired of all the other scents so i went with something original and im impressed.</li>
    <li> Refreshing. Never tried it before; was a user of big brand names for years. Love the refreshing smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> My wife really likes as does my daughter. Inexpensive and it smells great. Reminds of the barbershops back when I was a kid...</li>
    <li> I wanted to try a new after shave lotion since I recently began wet shaving. Surprisingly , this stuff is really good. Not only does the product do what its supposed to do it also comes at a fair price. A lot of people I know use the mainstream after shave lotion, but I&#x27;ve received various compliments from using this classic after shave lotion.</li>
    <li> Reminds me of the barber shop smell as a child.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It cools your face and has that great, classic, barber shop scent you&#x27;ll remember.  Does a good job, even on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Old timey natural scents.  No nonsense.  Fades away quickly enough to not offend anyone without the good taste to love it. Don&#x27;t know how i survived without it.  Goes perfectly with 100+ year old razors.</li>
    <li> Smells very good, and does last a while.</li>
    <li> I had some razor burns after shaving and this cooled my face real good. I recommend it highly. Very highly.</li>
    <li> Pros:  Smells great&lt;br /&gt;  Lot of kick from the alcohol&lt;br /&gt;  Suddenly the women I know/work with are huggers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Consistently late for work.  Learned to avoid the gf after using in the morning so not as much of a problem.&lt;br /&gt;  Lot of kick from the alcohol&lt;br /&gt;  Makes you feel like you&#x27;re John Wayne&lt;br /&gt;  Had to go buy a bunch of hand tools to up my manliness.&lt;br /&gt;  Doesn&#x27;t come with man card</li>
    <li> Recently started wet shaving and wanted something classic to follow the shaving process with. I&#x27;m 44 and this reminds me of the barber shop I got my haircuts back in the early 70&#x27;s. Definitely a tried and true scent. The alcohol works well with my face after the shave. Have also gotten my 70 year old father back on the double edge and sent this to him. This, combined with the &#x27;66 super speed I gave him, brings back many memories for him. Classic with a little sting, great end to a shave.</li>
    <li> It took about 24 hours for me to really figure out why my sense memory was nagging at me ever since I first put this on.  Before my switch to a DE razor and badger brush, Barbasol was my preferred can of shaving cream, and there&#x27;s definitely a hint of that smell in this aftershave.  But it was something else, something much farther back... I kept getting flashbacks to 6th grade. Always gym class. Flashing images of the locker room. Occasional images of the 6th grade gym coach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was starting to wonder if the smell was awakening long repressed and extremely uncomfortable childhood memories involving the gym coach, when it finally hit me. Deodorant.  There was some sort of deodorant that I had in my locker that smelled very similar to this.  Why I still remember the smell of the deodorant I kept in my 6th grade gym locker, I have no idea. Even though I haven&#x27;t thought about it in so many years, it&#x27;s still vivid in my memory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yet, twice a week I still make that last-minute dash to the curb when I hear the garbage truck coming because I forgot to put the trash out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway.  From a scent standpoint, I like it.  My wife likes it better than the bottle of [[ASIN:B0066GR55K Captain&#x27;s Choice Bay Rum Aftershave]] that I bought not too long ago, although she does like the Captain&#x27;s Choice as well (after it has settled for about 30 minutes; if she smells the CC right after application, she hates it).  It lasts forever.  I was wondering about this because some reviews say it disappears almost immediately, while others say that they can still smell it the next day!  For me, it was definitely long lasting.  I could smell it the rest of the day, and I even caught a quick whiff of it when I first got in the shower the next morning.  I&#x27;ve taken to mixing it with witch hazel at about a 1:1 ratio in the palm of my hand before applying; I like the astringent properties of the witch hazel, and it means using half as much aftershave which cuts down on the intensity of the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is also a great benefit over the CC Bay Rum, coming in at nearly a third of the price for 50% more product (6 oz. instead of 4 oz.).  The great thing about the CC Bay Rum though, is the ingredients. Alcohol, Witch Hazel, Glycerin, spices &amp; extracts. That&#x27;s it.  The Clubman Pinaud has a number of hard-to-pronounce ingredients and artificial coloring (why?).  Both do a great job of making my face feel soft and clean all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, if I didn&#x27;t see such a big deal being made of the alcohol sting in so many reviews (not just here, but other aftershaves too) I never would have guessed it was even worth mentioning. There&#x27;s a little bite when you apply any alcohol-based aftershave right after shaving, but who cares.  It was cute when Macaulay Culkin made a big deal about it in 1990, but he was TEN YEARS OLD. Man up. Sheesh.the intensity of the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is also a great benefit over the CC Bay Rum, coming in at nearly a third of the price for 50% more product (6 oz. instead of 4 oz.).

    <li> Great scent, with a good burn</li>
    <li> I love the way this smells on my husband.</li>
    <li> Started using a DE safety razor and bought some Clubman Pinaud to complete the whole retro purchase.  This stuff is great.  The smell reminds me of the barbershop I use to use in the &#x27;90s and it does an awesome job soothing my face after a 3 pass shave.  With a product that&#x27;s been around for 200 years, can you find a better recommendation?</li>
    <li> I love this aftershave! Finally something that doesn&#x27;t smell like baggy jean wearing post pubescent miscreants!</li>
    <li> The best way I can think of to describe the smell of Axe, and alot of these new cologne&#x27;s and sprays out there is to paraphrase one of my favorite songs and say \\&quot;Boy, you got a lotta boot left to fill.\\&quot; Clubman smells classic, traditional, and manly.  It smells like you just got a shave from a classic, hole in the wall, barber shop, like our fathers, uncles, grandfathers, etc. would do.  It&#x27;s different because all these boy scents out there that are in the mainstream smell nothing like it and they tend to all smell the same.  As for me, I like being different and I&#x27;ve always walked my own path.  I&#x27;m glad this is not a mainstream product and I hope it never becomes a mainstream product because I feel like us men that use this aftershave are members of an elite club and I would much rather be a member of this elite club of gentlemen than to conform with the collective of boys, boy bands, and bieber freaks of the world.</li>
    <li> arde !! impecable !! rica fragancia</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, smells good and instantly takes away any stinging after shaving the head!!! The reviews here really compelled us to purchase here and the quality of the product seems good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had to take off 1 star because the sticker on the bottle is made of that tin foil sticker crap.. lol don&#x27;t care for it but other than that its pretty good stuff! Good size bottle as well.</li>
    <li> My favorite aftershave fragrance of all time. Brings back great memories of that fresh haircut before the big game on Friday nights.</li>
    <li> it helped with my razor burn but my wife HATES the smell.  She says I smell like her grandfather.  Not a good thing</li>
    <li> Classic scent. If you like barber shops and a clean smell you will like this. My dad used this and it seems some scents never get old.</li>
    <li> A great smell use for lotion/ sterilizing since shaving cuts off 2-3 layers of skin off you face aftershave is required to help your skin heal its self to prevent blemish i love the clean sensation (and stinging for the nicks) it leaves my face a bit dry but then again i always shower with hot shower and use heavy bar soap on my face, i will buy again for when i run out!! would recommend for purchsehttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000053L6Y/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_16</li>
    <li> I started off with this for aftershave when I switched away from cartridge shaving. I love the smell, healing and slight burn.</li>
    <li> This lotion always leaves me feeling super soft. It is very harsh at first, but that is how you know it is doing its job of closing the pores. The only other thing is that my girlfriend and I joke about how I smell like a grandfather, but she loves it either way. She likes how manly it is.</li>
    <li> I mean irritating in the physical sense. This aftershave really irritated my skin. I tried it a few times to be sure, and each time it caused red blotches on my face. It smells nice and it&#x27;s inexpensive, but I definitely can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Bought it for the price and the rave reviews.  I was expecting the scent to linger most of the day.  Unfortunately, the scent is gone after 15 minutes, so I do not get the masses of women clawing all over me.  Seriously, I am disappointed the scent doesn&#x27;t last on me longer than it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice sting to it, after splashing on after a close shave.  But I do not feel any better than after I used Geo Trumper  Coral Skin Food  [[ASIN:B000VL52GU B000VL52GU]]  .  I am also going to try the Old Spice classic aftershave  [[ASIN:B00187PWDY B00187PWDY]]  , as soon as my order comes in.  That is what my dad used.  I am of the age to revert to the products my dad used in my youth, like it and DE wet shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing I like the sting, unsure of if it is doing anything, and am disappointed the smell doesn&#x27;t linger longer.  Will use the product up, and will most likely not re-order, especially if the classic Old Spice does the same for me.  But the Geo Trumper Coral skin food is what I will most likely use, long term, because of its light scent and cool refreshing feel.</li>
    <li> Bougt this for my 96 year old dad at his request. This is the lotion that was used in barbar shops when he was ayoung man and it has not changed in 80 years or more.</li>
    <li> I wanted the old-fashioned bay rum type after shav, and this product fulfills that need. The price is fair too.</li>
    <li> It is your favorite barbershop in a bottle. It does smell that fresh. Tophat not included. A great product standing firm in an industry that is being plastered by all sorts of random things. I&#x27;ve made a move from Brut and don&#x27;t see myself going back.</li>
    <li> It was just an OK lotion. I am used to a lotion after my shave and have been using similar products since the last 20 years. I purchased this based on good reviews on Amazon but didnt find it that interesting that I&#x27;ll buy it again</li>
    <li> Very reasonably prices, seven dollars for six ounces. Great mild smell reminds me of Canoe. The smell brings me back to the barbershop when I was a kid. Nice feel when you apply it to your face after the shave.</li>
    <li> I am used to a lotion after my shave and have been using similar products for the last 20 years. I purchased this based on good reviews on Amazon</li>
    <li> This stuff comes in a plastic bottle (darn, looked more epic online), but is the original Clubman scent....my wife calls it &amp;#34;masculine baby oil&amp;#34;...I can see the resemblance.  Good size, will definitely last a while (I shave every other day on average).  Well worth it!</li>
    <li> I think there are a lot of confederate reviewers on this product, either part of Clubman company or paid for reviews.  This product is nothing like the hype suggests. The scent is weak and does not last but an hour. It may be that it has become popular and to fill the orders they&#x27;ve diluted the formula. Drop a couple ounces of your favorite cologne in equally cheap bottle and it may be better.</li>
    <li> This stuff reminds me of going to the barber shop as a kid with my father.  When I was a teen I would get a high and tight and they would shave the sides of my head, then apply this.  I love the scent.</li>
    <li> I like the price and quantity of the lotion. Did not expect such a bottle of this size when I ordered it. The bottle is also made of plastic so safe to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gives pinch for a second then feels good. This is going to be in my regular buy list now on.</li>
    <li> In the 1960s, when I first started shaving, I used my Dad&#x27;s after shaves...Old Spice, Clubman, Aqua Velva, and Barbasol.  In the seventies, I tried my first &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; colognes and found that for an extraordinary price, I could wear a fragrance that made me smell somewhere between a man and a woman.  This coincided with giving up my double edge, safety razor for the newly advertised &amp;#34;triple blade, disposable razor.&lt;br /&gt;I quickly got over that phase and went back to my old Gillette Super Speed razor with double edge blades.  I rediscovered the old after shaves and haven&#x27;t looked back.&lt;br /&gt;On the days that I use Clubman, I get questions and comments from the women in the office about how great it smells and what it is.  I get the same comments about the Barbasol as well.  Most say that it smells so good that they want to buy some for their husbands.&lt;br /&gt;To me, it&#x27;s a timeless after shave that has a pleasant, &amp;#34;just left the barber shop&amp;#34; fragrance.  It&#x27;s not overwhelming( it won&#x27;t suffocate people in an elevator like some designer colognes do) but does leave a gentle scent that is noticed...and always liked.</li>
    <li> This product really works. My skin always burns after using electric shavers. This magical liquid, used right after the shave, would instantly relief the burning sensation (or prevent it from even taking place), and honestly it&#x27;s doing exactly what I bought it for. For the price, it does its job well.&lt;br /&gt;I am taking a star away because 1. it does smell quite strong at times, and some people might not like the scent. I am not a huge fan of overly scented lotions. 2. The consistency (viscosity) very liquidy, it makes it almost hard to apply on to your face without getting all over your hands and neck.</li>
    <li> I just started straight shaving not too long ago and needed an aftershave that would &amp;#34;calm&amp;#34; my sensitive skin after the shave. This is it! It burns at first, but leaves the skin very smooth and smells great (a herb-citrusy-vanilla like smell)! Would definitely buy this product again and probably their other products as well!</li>
    <li> A great smell that is cheaper than most of the most popular blends. Long lasting and mellows down as its on, never smelling like a French Ho has its&#x27; advantages.&lt;br /&gt;Love it&#x27;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never frequented an old school barbershop, but that seems to be the consensus on the smell.  What I do know is that I enjoy it, and it&#x27;s classic many, though not harsh, smell is quite nice.  It&#x27;s alcohol based (even has warnings regarding its flammability), but I don&#x27;t mind it (unlike some I&#x27;ve tried before).  A definite keeper!</li>
    <li> Our Great Grandads knew something I just discovered- Clubman Pinaud is great aftershave! Very good astringent characteristics and a fantastic manly scent that unfortunately doesn&#x27;t last very long. A bottle lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> smells great and manly guys!</li>
    <li> OMG I smell like a man. LIke an old time barber shop. Like ... this is probably what John Wayne smelled like walking around. He may not be able to act worth a crap, but he sure as hell carried himself like he did. IT&#x27;s a very masculine feel to the scent.</li>
    <li> this is very hard to find anywhere else and trust me i have tried&lt;br /&gt;it is a classic aftershave that is cool and refreshing would recommend</li>
    <li> This after shave is as advertised.  Very good especially considering the price.&lt;br /&gt;If you are not for the most recent then you will like this</li>
    <li> Love this product, smells fresh and clean, my husband had actually bought it and I liked it so much I bought one for our son :-)</li>
    <li> Some days you just feel that swagger and this 200 year old classic aftershave ties it all together. I expected it to smell too strong and pungent, but it is just perfect in every way. If you are getting into old school shaving you can confidently buy a bottle of this and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> It says lotion in the product description... That&#x27;s not the case. It&#x27;s like any cheap after shave like lectric or aqua velvet... Definitely not a lotion.</li>
    <li> Overall, this is a really good product.  It gives that nice burn when I use it and the scent doesn&#x27;t linger too long.  My wife says it makes me smell like an old lady, which I find funny, because I didn&#x27;t know old ladies smelled of manliness.  I&#x27;ll probably stick with this stuff for a while.</li>
    <li> Smells great!  I get compliments on it every week.</li>
    <li> Smells like the barber shop and drives the ladies with (grand-)daddy issues wild.</li>
    <li> Awesome classic barber scent and very soothing!</li>
    <li> I love this Clubman Pinuad scent takes me back to the days when the barber would sit me up into the booster seat in his chair. This is the scent I use most often.</li>
    <li> Old timey, but classic.  I really like it.</li>
    <li> I used to apply old spice after shave but for some reason I stopped applying after shave for the last 5 yrs. I wanted to get an aftershave with manly scent and i decided to go for Culbman Pinaud after seeing rave reviews and reasonable price in Amazon and I&#x27;m glad I got this, as many of the reviewers have said, it does remind me of good old barber shop and has this manly smell that I don&#x27;t get from fancy deodorants or Cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving 4 starts because I feel that some times my skin seems to get dry after applying this after shave, may be it is just for me. It is not expensive item and I would suggest others to give it a try.</li>
    <li> Definitely a great buy..... the slight sting with the first splash tells you that the bracer is working leaving you feeling invigorated and ready to go.  The scent is light and refreshing too.</li>
    <li> I switch off between this and the special reserve. Both are excellent and make you smell like a man, unlike the kid stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 16, this isn&#x27;t usually what kids in my school smell like. Either they stink, or smell obnoxiously like a bodyspray. By the time you&#x27;re done getting ready, have out this on, and have gone out for the day; it will have the perfect light, distinct, classic, full-bodied, aroma that sets you apart from every other person that girl has been around that day ;) This is inexpensive as well, so I anticipate purchasing Bay Rum and Vanilla in the future for some variety to cycle through. They can also work well as colognes if you&#x27;re not one to spend the buck on &amp;#34;flower water&amp;#34; like many.</li>
    <li> Love everything about this aftershave but the container. I really wish it came in a glass bottle. I can see the idea of it (a glass bottle) slipping and breaking in the bathroom and the additional shipping due to weight however... the feel and style of this just seems like it should be glass.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews for this product and wanted to try it for a change from my OLD SPICE regimen ... Truly it was a revelation !!! I have become a fan !!!</li>
    <li> Clubman Pinaud smells like nostalgia: warm, friendly, and pleasing. If you spent any amount of time in a barbershop, you&#x27;ll be familiar with the scent as Clubman Pinaud is the usual go-to aftershave in those establishments. Goes on strong, but settles into a nice, subtle scent after a hour or so. It&#x27;s all class.</li>
    <li> The Marine Corps barber always used it after my cut. Just an all around great, fresh, relaxing feel &amp; aroma. I&#x27;ve never had any negative comments about wearing it.</li>
    <li> Ever since I can remember, my barber dabs a little of this stuff on the back of the neck after a haircut.  It&#x27;s the quintessential barbershop scent.  Oh, and it&#x27;s o cheap you can buy a bottle at CVS with the change in your console.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband for a birthday present. I gave this to him with his first straight razor and other shaving products. He really likes this shave lotion, and I think it smells great.</li>
    <li> I have gone to the double edge shaver.  A quality razor and blade a good brush and soap and clubman. Clubman smells great but more, it is a terrific astringent leaving my face feeling  great after a close shave.</li>
    <li> I loved this product and it smells wonderful on.......wife really loves it too......Will buy this product again as it feels good on my face too....</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t too bad. The product&#x27;s smell reminds me a little of either classic Old Spice or Stetson aftershaves (can&#x27;t really remember which... maybe both). Of course this has alcohol in it and I&#x27;m a little disappointed in that, but of course that&#x27;s my fault since I didn&#x27;t read the ingredients closely enough. It goes a long ways though. Only a small amount is needed, so this 6 ounce container goes far.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this lotion.  It is alcohol based, and you will get quite a sting when you apply it.  But it cools your face and leaves it tight and smooth.  If you love that old-time barbershop smell of talc, you will love this product.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> MASCULINE, BUT STINGY</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to smell like a man and not a twelve year old boy.  I use this stuff on my head nearly everyday.  It definitely reminds me of the the barbershops of years past.  Of course I haven&#x27;t been in a barbershop in years myself though.</li>
    <li> My old man likes it.  He says it makes a difference in that it closes up his pores so he doesn&#x27;t get in-grown hairs when he shaves.  OK, if you say so dear.  The smell is kind of old-school which he likes (if you like Axe just do us all a favor &amp; get something else).  It&#x27;s a little pungent at first (not to the point of stinging the nostrils or anything) but it dissipates quickly &amp; he just smells clean and manly.  And it&#x27;s not made from bits of real panther which is always a bonus.</li>
    <li> Bought this product to help with my razor burn and bumps, and after all of my skepticism I am really glad that I decided to purchase this after shave. The scent is enjoyable, but doesn&#x27;t linger too much after applied</li>
    <li> Great positive reviews. I used my electric razor for about a year but recently gave up on it. Eleck razors just take too long. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t find my after shaves. I came across this while looking for something else and remembered this as my favorite aftershave and I can&#x27;t find it.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I&#x27;ll go to the drugstore tomorrow and pick up a bottle before I shave. I would order it from Amazon but I would have to wait two days which I can&#x27;t after reading these reviews. All this time and I thought I was the only guy still using it now I find it is the best selling aftershave on Amazon.  I&#x27;m glad that it is so popular  because this is a great product at an unbelievably great price. I use the talc every night - just love the scent.  Also, it is a perfectly logical companion to the Arko shave soap in my kit.</li>
    <li> I have both Pinaud and Proraso and I like Pinaud better. It smells better. No offense to the guys that like Proraso but to me it smells like cat urine - I think about a cat litter box everytime I put it on  :)  I&#x27;m sure other people don&#x27;t smell cat urine so yes, I still use it, but honestly it&#x27;s just kinda weird because I feel like I&#x27;m splashing on bottled cat urine. I do like the fact that Proraso has more of a &amp;#34;lotiony&amp;#34; feel to it though. But it&#x27;s Pinaud for me all the way - reminds me of an old classic barber shop. My wife likes it too.</li>
    <li> The best after shave I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Feels good on the skin after shaving, essentially cured my ingrown hairs and breakouts after shaving and has a pleasant aroma.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and so does my fiance. It stings going on and makes you puff up your chest as you walk out of the bathroom smelling like the man you fantasized becoming when you were a kid.</li>
    <li> If you want something that reminds you of how men smelled fresh from a barbershop- this is for you. My husband loves this- me, only after a couple hours when it&#x27;s faded some- it&#x27;s pretty strong.</li>
    <li> I picked up a bottle of Clubmans at my local pharmacy one day not long after breaking up with my girlfriend. I had been using some kind of expensive froo-froo stuff  she purchased for me because she liked the way it smelled. I didn&#x27;t mind it but I realized after the break-up, when I put it on it dredged up memories so I tossed it. The night after 86ing the foo-foo stuff I needed aftershave so I grabbed the first thing I saw on the shelf because it was cheap and there was lots of it in the bottle. Thus began my new love affair. I absolutely love Clubman Pinaud After Shave. After the first splash on my mug, my eyes burned a little bit and the scent hit me like a truck, a very pleasant, manly truck. Some reviewers here complain about the strong smell...I think it&#x27;s awesome. I shave my head as well to so my entire dome gets doused with Clubmans on the daily and I like that the pleasant odor follows me all day at work and well into the evening. I was happy when I saw it was available on Amazon and it is now my go-to fragrance. No need for cologne after applying this stuff. The best part, it is inexpensive and very blue-collaresque so I know my ex would hate it. I absolutely recommend Clubmans Pinaud After Shave Lotion for any guy who is ready to toss the girly-man aftershave and use something that smells like a guys aftershave should. 5 Stars!</li>
    <li> It is an inexpensive but great product. Feels nice on the skin - wife loves the smell too! I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> It soothes and works great.. also reminds me of Grandpa too.</li>
    <li> This is the first alcohol-based aftershave I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I am hopelessly addicted to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a creature of habit. My shave arsenal (John Allan&#x27;s Slick Water, Taylor of Old Bond Street Eton College cream, ToOBS \\&quot;Mr. Taylor&#x27;s\\&quot; aftershave balm) does not change often, but I&#x27;ve looked longingly at alcohol-based aftershaves, thinking \\&quot;I wish my über-sensitive skin could handle that, but I&#x27;d probably just start on fire, no matter how great it smelled or worked\\&quot;. I realized, however, that I&#x27;d never even TRIED an alcohol-based aftershave, and that, in our modern, free world, a man is able to order things such as this on Amazon, just to see how they work. He is also not bound by law to use just one aftershave- he could have, in his cabinet... even two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying a nickel-sized puddle of this to the face is the right way to start any day, even if you don&#x27;t shave that day. I have, as I mentioned, über sensitive skin, and this has an initial, invigorating heat to it, but it doesn&#x27;t burn at all. It also doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I was worried about that, after having some awful aftershave moments when I started wet shaving and trying different stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was worried that the smell would be too strong, even though I liked it a lot. It&#x27;s not overpowering once you slap it on, and its intensity lessens throughout the day. The bottle describes the scent as \\&quot;suave\\&quot; and \\&quot;manly\\&quot;. I think these are pretty good adjectives, and quite a bit more effectively descriptive than the analogy which I was trying to form, which involved Errol Flynn&#x27;s armpits, the tropics, and French royalty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try this stuff. You won&#x27;t regret it. Even if you&#x27;re afraid of it. Try it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and it reminds of getting haircuts when I was a young teenager, all barbers in Brooklyn NY kept this stuff on hand at all times! It helps with razor burn, sensitive skin, and also serves as a moisteurizer. This stuff is totally old school. However old this magic juice is, the smell is still very pleasing, masculine, and refreshing. Awesome product will always buy.</li>
    <li> I like it. It is nice smelling like a man. You want to smell more grown up? Get some of this stuff. Price is very reasonable for the size of the bottle and the quality of it.</li>
    <li> Not a girly scent. A MAN&#x27;s scent. Well I guess it depends on your definition of a man. It is not a fruity scent. It is not a sage brush. But don&#x27;t be an amateur and nick your self while shaving this will let you know.</li>
    <li> This is so awesome. It smells like the barbershop. It smells like a man should. Great buy. Will definitely buy this again when i run out.</li>
    <li> Classic scent - reminds me of the old school barber shops.</li>
    <li> So, I discovered that the scent of the Clubman after shave is noticeably different and less pleasant when the bottle has been sitting for a while, so make sure to shake it before each use.  This may account for some people who said they didn&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently saw the razor commercial by the Pawn Stars guy and decided to try an old-school safety razor, not the one they were selling on TV but a quality one off Amazon.  Anyway, I decided while I&#x27;m going old-school I might as well get some old-school after shave and I doubt you could get more old-school than a brand that has been around for over 200 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely like it, but the real judge of whether this is any good is the lady in your life.  My wife said I smelled good, so for me it&#x27;s a winner.</li>
    <li> The light, masculine scent really did remind me of a barbershop. When I put it on after shaving, it stung for a couple seconds but let me know I&#x27;m alive! A nice, inexpensive alternative to cologne. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> Pleasant and retro. Most men know the sandalwood-like smell from the Pinaud talc they still use in old fashioned barber shops. It&#x27;s not a truly great cologne like you&#x27;d get from a great Jermyn street perfumer like Floris or Penhaligon, but it&#x27;s manly agreeable, and suggests old-fashioned propriety and democratic refinement. I don&#x27;t know that a youngster could carry this off, but if you&#x27;re old enough to wear a beret without looking like you&#x27;re in costume, this would work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t for the life of me figure why they haven&#x27;t hiked the price and marketed this to hipsters for the irony value. Good fashion move if you&#x27;re twenty something with horn rims and &amp;#34;interesting&amp;#34; facial hair. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s also the price to consider. This is dead cheap and you&#x27;d spend four times as much to find better in a compounded cologne. Good value for everyday wear.</li>
    <li> This stuff does it!&lt;br /&gt;Very strong manly aroma. You dont have to use alot, just a small ammount does the trick.</li>
    <li> Smells great, gives that great light burn, and heals sking quick. Probably won&#x27;t get again since i prefer an aftershave gel or lotion to this at my age of 21, but will reccommend.</li>
    <li> Just like the aftershave in clubs and gyms  Unpleasant smaell</li>
    <li> Great feeling and smell and it holds up for a while.  I realize aftershaves with alchohol will burn a bit- but if you shave correctly- it will not be at all uncomfortable.  And the smell is very pleasant in my opinion.  Great price also.</li>
    <li> THE traditional barbershop smell. Many people like and dislike this product for the same reason. After you use it, it smells like you stepped out if an old timey barber shop.&lt;br /&gt;Like any alcohol based aftershave, it burns when you splash it on. After it dries, it leaves my skin good and clean. I have not noticed it drying out my face and I use it daily.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a reason it&#x27;s been around for 200 years.</li>
    <li> A great aftershave that will wake you up because of the alchohol. You&#x27;ll smell like a man, not like a 13 year old boy. The scent is noticable from close distance, but is not so strong that everyone in a 100&#x27; area of you will notice.</li>
    <li> Have been using Clubman after shave for years. Remembered it from my youth and set out to find it. Every time I use it the women swoon all over me and all but hump my leg. Cracks me up. Another great feature, initially it might be a bit strong but very shortly after using, it fades. However, and maybe it&#x27;s just me but as the day wears on and actually, when I get a bit sweaty, believe it or not, it smells even more sexy. Hell, sometimes I turn myself on. Guys also comment on the fragrance and often ask what it is. They are shocked when I tell them it&#x27;s from my childhood. Tried Axe some time ago...phew, stanky and every time I get near anyone wearing it, it even rubs off on me and stays with all day till I take a shower and change cloth, like running into a skunk. Guys, do yourself (and your lady) a favor, get this stuff.</li>
    <li> I love the way this stuff smells totally reminds me of my barber shop and gives that manly scent I love about going to a &amp;#34;barber shop&amp;#34;. It also is very soothing and refreshing after a shave.</li>
    <li> I got it because the reviews said it was not only cheap but also smells really good, which is true in both cases, my friends always tell me that I smell really good all day long when I use it!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite parts of going to the barber shop is when, at the end, the barber sprinkles Clubman talcum powder on the back of my neck. It not only feels great, but the smell is just lovely. This aftershaves smells just like that! Great old-time barbershop smell, but doesn&#x27;t smell like &amp;#34;old man.&amp;#34; It smells very classy and refined, without being too overbearing.</li>
    <li> Clubman reminds me of back in the day, old time barber shops that would apply Clubman after giving you an old fashioned straight edge shave. The scent is the same and the application of splashing on face and refreshing the skin is also no different. They give a big bottle but when I finally finish it I will order more.</li>
    <li> This stuff is powerful, inexpensive, and packs a classic barbershop scent. Unfortunately, I find it too sweet. It&#x27;s just not for me. I much prefer Pinaud&#x27;s Lime Sec, as well as other brands&#x27; Bay Rum aftershaves.</li>
    <li> Good. Clean. Barbershop. Manly.</li>
    <li> Great Product! I love the smell and the way it makes my face feel. My Wife likes it too! She usually doesn&#x27;t like any of my previous after shave lotions (25 years worth)</li>
    <li> The smell is alright, it&#x27;s more of a powder smell. I (as well and my gf) prefer Brut because it&#x27;s a little more manly, though both are cheap.</li>
    <li> My dad worked at Country Club when I was very young. I would occasionally go in with him before it opened and the locker rooms were stocked with this stuff. Maybe I&#x27;m a bit nostalgic for it, but I can&#x27;t get enough of this.&lt;br /&gt;It is a classic smell. Old school barbershop + Country Club + General Baddassery.&lt;br /&gt;Too much can be overwhelming, so be smart about it, but it is a timeless scent.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t care what the other guys on here say.... This stuff works in your 20&#x27;s &amp; 30&#x27;s as well as your 50&#x27;s &amp; 60&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;It is a manly scent... Not a flowery, poofy, wannabe hipster perfume</li>
    <li> What an awsome smell and doesn&#x27;t burn as bad as others</li>
    <li> Smells intrigingly different and pleasant. Strong at first but mellows out after a bit. Very musk like and spicy. Smells like an old time barber shop, where everyone is your friend.</li>
    <li> Smells like 50 years of old man.</li>
    <li> This is the best after shave on the market, affordable and smells like a clean shave.  Actually look forward to using this stuff after a shave, clean and crisp!</li>
    <li> I purchased Pinaud&#x27;s Bay Rum and loved it. So much so I decided to give more of their products a sample since they are very affordable. This one is by far my least favorite which is a nicer way of saying my most hated. Aside from this and the Bay Rum I also used the Special Reserve and of the 3, this is the only one I would never wear in public. The smell was very flowery with a bit of a baby powder smell. I think it sort of reminds me of Avon&#x27;s Skin So Soft or Magno Black Glycerin Soap by La Toja. It smells much closer to Magno, but since Magno is only slightly familiar here now in the U.S. (I&#x27;ve only seen it sold in Spain and here on Amazon) Skin so Soft is also kind of similar. That in itself doesn&#x27;t seem so bad except it is REALLY strong and it stays strong for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think all of the Clubman products are great at soothing your face after a shave, better than most I would say. That is probably why so many barbers swear by the stuff. However, Clubman also has a load of different scents to choose from and this one is definitely NOT my style. I wish there was a way to sample the scents before buying, but Clubman is more likely to be sold in a pharmacy than a fancy department store where there is a girl at the perfume counter waiting to let you sample everything under the sun. The good news is that a bottle will usually run you between 3 and 5 bucks so even if you have to buy their entire lineup to find one you like, it would still be cheaper than most of those trendy expensive brands that smell great but feel terrible after a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I REALLY hated the scent of this stuff, but I haven&#x27;t sworn off clubman just yet. Their Bay Rum is great and there are still lots of other scents in their lineup I&#x27;d be willing to sample. It feels great and its cost effective provided you find one that fits you.</li>
    <li> this product is an established and respected after shave. it isnot drying to your face. it is very reasonably priced. the fragrance is notoverwhelming, yet it gives a fresh, masculine, fragrance that lasts. wuld recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used to see Clubman at the drugstore (in glass bottles) but at the time I was an Old Spice and Aramis guy. Bought a bottle of this on a lark to get an order up over the $35 mark and tried it the next weekend (weekends are when I&#x27;m alone and if it bombs I don&#x27;t have to suffer all day with it).&lt;br /&gt;After the alcohol flashed off and the essence warmed on my skin the most pleasant aroma filled the room, but not overpowering. And you won&#x27;t smell like the boys in gym class with their Bod and Axe.</li>
    <li> I can recall this familiar smell in barber shops when i was a kid. I love this stuff and it is really refreshing. A must have for anyone who loves shaving.</li>
    <li> This is alcohol based, so it&#x27;s not super pleasant on nics and cuts, but it works great in conjunction with some cold water to close up pores, kill bacteria, and keep the face feeling fresh and clean all day.</li>
    <li> I ran out of after shave balm and decided to give this a try based on the excellent reviews here.  When it first arrived, I liked the scent, but I quickly realized that it was kind of overpowering.  The fragrance is advertised as masculine, but in my personal opinion smelling strongly of any product is not particularly manly.  If you apply enough of this cover your face, you will be smelling it all day.  In addition to the smell, I don&#x27;t find that this product is particularly soothing to the skin.  Its mainly alcohol (I&#x27;m pretty sure the bottle actually warns the user to keep it away from open flames), which tends to dry one&#x27;s skin.  After trying this for a few days, I went back to my previous after shave and haven&#x27;t looked back.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, no more bumps and reminds me of when my dad would go to the old school barbers! AWSOME!</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. This is becoming hard to find in the drug stores.</li>
    <li> First off, if you are a member of the metro-sexual, Axe spraying, Justin Bieber listening boys club move along. This product is a man&#x27;s man&#x27;s aftershave. When you put it onto your face and your ass will pucker, but the tingling lets you know your alive. You need a current man card to appreciate the simplicity of it, yet need to be able to distinguish between the complexity of what it means to use a man&#x27;s man&#x27;s product and the responsibility in doing so. It&#x27;s the stuff a real barber uses on you after a shave or hair cut in a barber shop that men go to. The type of barber shop that the WWII vet is waiting to kick some young punks ass with his cane for walking in with sagging pants. If this is too much for you to grasp or appreciate don&#x27;t waste your time, Axe products are always looking for more weenies!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the smell of this stuff. Old mannish? Ya maybe but I&#x27;m 50 and don&#x27;t want to smell like a 19 year old going into a Justin Bieber concert. Feel like I just left the barber&#x27;s chair after every shave.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Wish I would have gotten a bottle of the Bay Rum at the same time. Give you that barber shop smell without being too wafty around work.</li>
    <li> Great soothing aftershave. The smell doesn&#x27;t overpower you, but is just right.&lt;br /&gt;It brings back memories of an old barbershop....&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong at this price !</li>
    <li> I cannot give legitimate feedback on the product itself because it was so poorly packaged that the bottle was broken sometime in transit. By the time the package was opened all of the after shave lotion had been evaporated or absorbed into the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t plan on repurchasing this product, but thought I would at least give everyone else a warning that bottle is plastic and may not survive the shipping process. Hopefully you have better luck than I do.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Smells great and provides a nice soothing feel after shaving with my safety razor. Inexpensive but does not smell cheap. Takes me back in time to when things were simpler.</li>
    <li> The Clubman Pinaud aftershave has a good, clean, manly smell; not too strong, just right. Very reasonably priced. Recommended for any man wanting a \\&quot;manly\\&quot; but pleasant aftershave lotion.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  Scent is a tad strong when initially slapped on but soon fades and not overwhelming.  How can you go wrong for the price?  Use it as often as possible.  Trust me - great product!</li>
    <li> Smells nice and manly. Burns you like a man too.</li>
    <li> Has a great barber shop smell when it dries on the face.  I love the smell.  It&#x27;s a bit strong and flowery when it first goes on, but that doesn&#x27;t last too long.  Sure, I don&#x27;t smell like a male model, but I don&#x27;t want to smell like desperation.</li>
    <li> Wife said it reminded her of her grandfather shaving with a tiny mirror in the kitchen farm house in the sixties.  Gives a refreshed feeling with out an over powering smell.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this stuff. Very Old school and confident smell. It does zap my minor cuts, if any and then refreshes your face.</li>
    <li> Good but little pricecee for the size</li>
    <li> I like the smell. It reminds me of the barber shop.</li>
    <li> Just this morning I used Clubman for the first time ever. I&#x27;m sitting in my office now, daydreaming about my grandfather, father and uncles, as they were the &amp;#34;men&amp;#34; of my youth. How can the smell be the exact same as 45 years ago? This stuff is primal and has triggered something in my brain that&#x27;s been dormant for that long. DAMN!!! I&#x27;m 53 and looking forward to using this and smelling this for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> Definitely has a unique, old manish, barber shoppy smell.  I use it about 1/2 and 1/2 with water or on a really wet face, otherwise I&#x27;d smell like grandpa Fester all day long.  I&#x27;m guessing I&#x27;ll have this bottle for about a decade.  A little goes a long way. Seems to do ok as an after shave as in helping with razor burn...</li>
    <li> Love the scent! Just add some pipe tobacco, and, bam! Smells like Grand Dad.&lt;br /&gt;A bit too much alcohol for an &amp;#34;aftershave&amp;#34; (can sting, a lot), but the scent is great.</li>
    <li> It smell very masculine.  It smells like a man leaving a barbershop that got the works.  One of the best scents out there. Everyman should have it in his Cologne collection. The have a great smelling powder too.</li>
    <li> Takes you back to the old barber shop days.  This was one of my Dad&#x27;s favorites, and now my hubby likes it as well.</li>
    <li> Now, I know what my aftershave brand will be for life. This aftershave is truly amazing. The smell is not overpowering, but it does the job well...VERY WELL.</li>
    <li> The best aftershave I have ever used. Reminds me of my fathers barber shop.</li>
    <li> You can not find a better value anywhere; Clubman is a solid mainstay for any serious shave den. People often equate &amp;#34;low cost&amp;#34; with &amp;#34;low quality&amp;#34;, but in this case I would advise that you throw that assumption out the window. This is a traditional, authentic, barbershop product with a pleasant, masculine scent that stays long after application. If you put me in a corner and made me select one aftershave for the desert island long-haul, there is absolutely no doubt that I would pick Clubman.</li>
    <li> Classics never die.  Stop using little boy after shaves.  Step up your game.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dad for father&#x27;s day and he really likes it! I&#x27;ve smelt it and it smells very fresh and clean. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Nothing like a splash of Clubman aftershave to wake you up in the morning! It&#x27;s alcohol based so if you nicked yourself, you&#x27;ll feel it- bit it&#x27;s a good feel. And then there&#x27;s that famous scent, which brings me back to my childhood trips to the barbershop but never smells &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;- just refreshing. The scent, as someone noted, is &amp;#34;olfactory nirvana.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing like it- so go ahead and treat yourself, my man!</li>
    <li> Great smell. Reminds me of an old barber shop.</li>
    <li> Bought this after receiving a sample from a straight razor supplier. Old time barbershop fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;If you are into retro shaving, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this product. This is my wife&#x27;s favorite product that I use.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday. He loves the tingling he gets after he applies it, and I love the smell! He says that he&#x27;ll never use another after shave.</li>
    <li> The smell on this is awesome. It reminds me of being a kid and getting the back of my head shaven with a razor. My wife likes the smell and sometimes thinks I put cologne on. So either this smells great or my cologne stinks!</li>
    <li> If you like the smell that you get after a cut at your local barbar shop, then this is the stuff your looking for.  I bought it to help with the little knicks i get here and there, and then i started using every day.  It gives you a unique classic smell that isn&#x27;t over powering and doesn&#x27;t linger like some after shaves do, you still smell good but you have to be close to smell it.  It sooth the face, but i still use a post shave lotion to rehydrate my skin a little more.  I plan on trying the other sents in due time.  I no longer smell like a kid anymore and its made in the USA ta boot!</li>
    <li> If you want to smell like a gentleman then this is the stuff for you. If you want to smell like a douchey play boy go buy that axe crap. This stuff is nice and smells good. It smells classy. Just a reminder cologne should be discovered not announced (same for after shave) that goes for perfume too ladies.</li>
    <li> Strong smell, perhaps too strong, but it gives you that barbershop feel when you are done shaving.  For the price it works well.  It does have alcohol, so you get to feel the burn.  If you like it that&#x27;s great, if not you may want to try Lucky Tiger brand.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE the old-school smell of this stuff. It&#x27;s a classic, fresh, masculine scent. It says it&#x27;s &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s really a splash. Nonetheless, it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin and doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
    <li> Memories of my grandfather walking me down the street, smelling his starched collar and Clubman aftershave on his chin.  Sitting on my fathers lap as he read to all 4 of us kids every night after dinner, a mixture of beer and the lingering remnants of Clubman aftershave.  With my head on his chest I could feel his voice rumble as well as hear it.  Conan Doyle, Mark Twain, OHenry rolled out accompanied by the slight beer breath and the lingering Clubman.  As a young man living in France, a university student, I would splurge once every couple of months with a haircut and a shave in a barbershop.  Always wound it up with a bracing splash of Clubman...reminded me of so many good, good memories. I didn&#x27;t even know it still existed til I saw a reference to it in a Robert D Parker novel.  Bought it and luxuriated.</li>
    <li> I have always loved the smell of this brand and continue to love it clients love it and gives them that fresh out of the barber shop smell and feel awesome product</li>
    <li> I is just about gone.  I am happy to have it and intend to order it once again.  The best response from others is &amp;#34;It smells just like my grandfather&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> nice! talk about bringing you back!</li>
    <li> I find this after shave gives off a very pleasant &#x27;Barber Shop&#x27; aroma.  In addition, it has the least bite or sting of any other after shave I&#x27;ve tried during my, somewhat, advanced age.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews about this and wanted to give it a shot. It has the old school smell of a shave. I liked it very much and would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Such a classic smell. Barber shop all the way. Does a great job on your skin after a shave.</li>
    <li> Has a bit of an old man smell, but it doesn&#x27;t last long. It does exactly what you expect in an aftershave. Good clean feel after applying.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at Walgreens for about $8. I&#x27;m only 24 so I don&#x27;t know what the &#x27;old barber shop smell&#x27; smells like. If it smells like what&#x27;s in this bottle...then it smells good. If you take the top off and smell it right out of the bottle, yes, the scent is VERY strong. But once you apply it to yourself and let it dry, the smell \\&quot;changes.\\&quot; It no longer has that super strong alcohol smell. The best way I found to find out what this really smells like if you&#x27;re unsure what you&#x27;ll smell like to others once it&#x27;s dry (you&#x27;ll get used to the smell so YOU won&#x27;t be able to smell but but others will) is to let some of it spill on the bottle, let it dry then smell it. The product works very well. It has done a great job making my skin taught and oil free. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an aftershave or just to rub some on when you&#x27;re ready to go out. The bottle will last you a pretty good while. - my shave: Edwin Jagger DE89 razor, Tweezerman badger shave brush, C.O. Bigelow (Proraso) shave cream and VDH Deluxe shave soap- thanks</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t burn but a second or 2. Smells great all day, reminds me of my grandfather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say for the ladies but I&#x27;ve learned in my years of dating that if you smell like their dad or grandfather they&#x27;re typically interested in smelling you. A lot :) Old Spice and this is irresistible.</li>
    <li> Excellent stuff old time Barber Shop. A bit of a sting, but very refreshing. Good Fragrance, well priced. Will (and have) buy again!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my teenage sun who just started shaving his beard. The barber shop where he gets his hair cut uses this lotion. He liked it so much and wanted to get one. Very Happy with the purchase!</li>
    <li> This stuff has a really great old fashioned smell that lasts all day long.  I have to give it 4 stars because even though I liked it my wife hated it and said it made me smell like an old man.</li>
    <li> old school Joe da Barba</li>
    <li> It works .. refreshing .. but the smell is off putting .. a cross between bug spray and a soiled diaper.&lt;br /&gt;Having tried Proraso first, I am going back now and staying clear of Pinaud</li>
    <li> Burn baby burn say good morning like a slap in the face. Attracts older an women like flys to fly paper.</li>
    <li> Just as described A++++++</li>
    <li> This is the ultamate in manliness, this stuff has so much respect it does not matter what it smells like anymore. When you splash this on, be careful because you will feel yourself transforming into a &amp;#34; take no crap from any woman&amp;#34; type of man. It took me by surprise, I almost forced my wife to clean all the dishes and clean the house!! Those who say this stuff is bad don&#x27;t understand the power of the KING OF WET SHAVING  CLUBMAN!!!!!</li>
    <li> When a product has been around since the days of Charles Darwin and Abraham Lincoln, you know there has to be something to it. This fine barber shop after shave has been used since Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday, soldiers in the Civil War throughout history up to the Titanic to the Queen Mary to today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s longevity is its validity. It smells great (Like a barber shop) and it cools and heals razor burn and makes your skin smooth. It will wake you up in the morning and smells much better than today&#x27;s after shave&#x27;s and cologne&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it and see why it has stood the test of time.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance of this particular one, Not sure how much its is effective in killing germs and protecting skin as I have bene using this only since last 3 weeks but its good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 recommendation I could give was product should have had some free flowing nozzle type neck, The current opening hole pours around the edge of bottle sometimes so bit tough to collect and as this product has benzene it vapourizes very soon.</li>
    <li> This stuff came recommended by the website Art of Manliness. I decided to give it a go and bought some on a whim when ordering other stuff. At first smell it really seems like any generic old school aftershave. But when you splash it on, you get this rush of the citrus smell. It&#x27;s FANTASTIC! Very good clean smell, gotten numerous comments on how good it smells from people both the ladies and other men wondering where to get it. Try it out.</li>
    <li> Want to smell like a waterfall, a spring meadow, a cucumber, or a bouquet of flowers? Then this is not the after shave for you. As hundreds of reviewers have noted, this after shave is for men. It harkens back to the era of real barber shops, not &amp;#34;styling salons.&amp;#34; It is a classic, manly, wonderful scent. Nothing unisex about it. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have said, this product is excellent.  Perfect &#x27;manly&#x27; smell, lasts all day, refreshing after a shave.  I don&#x27;t even wear cologne anymore, just this.</li>
    <li> Love the smell.  It does burn a bit going on but hasn&#x27;t caused any problems to my quite sensitive skin.  I&#x27;m a big fan.</li>
    <li> I just received my man card today. After splashing some Clubman on I feel like my iron jawed grandfather after coming home from World War 2 and killing Nazi&#x27;s and procreating with many French and Italian women. Yeah, today I feel like a MAN !!!!</li>
    <li> this product has exist from long ago and the barber shops used this product.&lt;br /&gt;Fresh smelling After Shave.&lt;br /&gt;It has the same original smell as the Original back in the Days.</li>
    <li> Hysterical reviews aside, this is a great product.  My assumption is that it&#x27;s made better by the memory I have associated with it but the fragrance is only part of its charm.  It has a positive effect on my skin after shaving.  I thought aftershave was a gimmick for guys who didn&#x27;t want to fess up to wearing cologne.  It&#x27;s not.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have to say, this stuff reminds me of barber shops of the 60&#x27;s when i was a child. Both of my grandfather&#x27;s used clubman after shave lotion so did my father, and now I&#x27;m in my mid 50&#x27;s, and I use it too. It reminds me of a time when a barber shaved around the ears and neck and clubman talc to dust your neck. I&#x27;ve used everything from Taylor Of Old Bond Street, Myrsol Blue, Jovan ...... ect. But Clubman Pinaud After Shave Lotion is the standard that I judge all after shave lotion by.</li>
    <li> High quality product worthy of 5 stars</li>
    <li> Love the smell, excellent to use</li>
    <li> Smells great, classic scent.</li>
    <li> This after shave is the Mans Man of After shave! I&#x27;m completely amazed that I haven&#x27;t heard of this sooner. You can find this stuff at Walgreens &amp;#34;shocker&amp;#34;. Go get a bottle guys you will love the old barber shop smell.</li>
    <li> I continue to buy this every time I am low! Love this product!</li>
    <li> I would buy it again. I like the masculine smell a lot and it is like a cologne/parfume, it stays with you for a long time and you can sense it all the time. It is really very pleasurable!$5 is a grat price for this. You get a plastic bottle, but who cares (surely a glass one would be more stylish)! I have to point out that this is a odor for mature men, like 25 and older. Do not hesitate on buying it, because it is cheap and smells great.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an old fashioned after shave, this is for you. It smells almost exactly like a barber shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re more of a fan of a more modern scent (unfortunately, my wife is), you should probably try something else.</li>
    <li> Still smells like my grandfather. Which is why its my only scent</li>
    <li> I just picked up a bottle today. It reminds me of the old days when men were men. It has a rather strong, complex scent that reminds me of an old fashioned barbershop, the kind where the barber used a big straight razor the size of a meat cleaver to shave you. Call me old school, but I enjoy the classic scent. So put down that girly smelling bottle of Axe and pick up some Clubman. Then light up a cigar...</li>
    <li> Love this after shave.  Has a nice bite to it with the alcohol in it.</li>
    <li> I Luv That Barbershop Smell.</li>
    <li> Wow, this aftershave is absolutely life changing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first use, I had 10 different women at work give me their phone numbers, and two more send me dirty pictures via email.  Later that night at the grocery store, the cashier gave me my groceries for free, and the manager gave me a lifetime of free groceries of I agreed to come back at least twice a week.  On the way home, someone actually left a space in front of them when I was trying to take a left out of the parking lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day, I went to the bank during lunch, and the Regional AVP was in the office.  She immediately fired the local branch president and offered me the job on the spot!  I asked about the hours, and she said just work whenever I feel like it, but to let her know so she could come visit.  She then whispered in my ear what she wanted to do to me in the bank vault on a pile of cash later that night!  Crazy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went out that night to celebrate, and the Most Interesting Man in the world was in the corner table of the local bar.  When I sat down,. the girls he was with came and sat with me.  He came over later and asked for my autograph and paid my tab!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning I woke up with ten extremely flexible women from Cirq-de-soliel in my bed!  They were fighting over who was going to make my breakfast and wash my laundry,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing stuff!</li>
    <li> Had high hopes for this one. Was very curious to know what this \\&quot;barber shop\\&quot; scent everyone keeps referring to smelled like. Well, now I know. It smells like Brut! :/ Really? That is my least favorite scent of all time and the ladies DO NOT like it. How in the world hasn&#x27;t anyone picked up on this yet? Heard the smell changes after drying in but, to the dismay of myself and others, it doesn&#x27;t. Going to straight to the trash... Good thing it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
    <li> Second week at A-Basin, as my husband and I waited in line for the chairlift, an intoxicating smell kept wafting around us. I usually don&#x27;t like perfumes and aftershaves (too many sons, too much Axe), but this was so \\&quot;je ne sais quoi\\&quot; it cast a spell. I tried to discreetly tilt my head towards its source to figure out where it was coming from, but could not. And then a handsome young snowboarder (dichotomy #1) asked to share our chair, and as luck would have it, it was he who smelled so divine (dichotomy #2). I honestly couldn&#x27;t resist--I leaned into him and said, \\&quot;Is that you who smells so, so good?\\&quot; He smiled a confident smile. \\&quot;What IS that?\\&quot; I asked, sniffing around his shoulders and neck. My husband was too surprised by my behavior to be made uncomfortable by it, and had become interested in the answer as well.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Are you married?\\&quot; he asked the two of us.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Yes!\\&quot; we said.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Then I&#x27;ll tell you,\\&quot; he said. \\&quot;Since your wearing it\\&quot; (gesturing to my husband) \\&quot;won&#x27;t cramp my style. I like to keep my pool as big as possible.\\&quot; And then he told us: Clubman. \\&quot;It&#x27;s weird,\\&quot; he said. \\&quot;I think my grandfather wore this aftershave, but every time I go out, women flock around me and can&#x27;t get enough of it. Kind of like you just did there.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I LOVE it!\\&quot; I said.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;It&#x27;s the PBR of aftershaves!\\&quot; my husband laughed.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Exactly,\\&quot; the handsome man with irresistible aromas emanating from his body said. \\&quot;And it looks like you might be getting some in your Christmas stocking this year.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;But as I sat there, leaning into him, sniffing his chest and left shoulder for the remainder of our time on the lift, something he&#x27;d said kept echoing through my brain:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;...every time I go out, women flock around me and can&#x27;t get enough...\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at my husband, sitting safely unmolested on my left. Then, I imagined him splashing a little Clubman on, hitting the slopes. I imagined dozens of cute Bettys coming out of the trees and bumps, crowding around him, sniffing his chest and shoulders, and oohing and ahhing about how good he smelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be no Clubman in my husband&#x27;s stocking this year.m, sniffing his chest and shoulders, and oohing and ahhing about how good he smelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be no Clubman in my husband&#x27;s stocking this year.</li>
    <li> Smells like that baby shampoo that you had when you were a kid that&#x27;s not supposed to make your eyes hurt. Also it&#x27;s so pungent that my nose burns when I breath and I&#x27;m practically forced to hold my breath until the smell goes away. Apart from that it works good. I&#x27;ll stick with Proraso Aftershave Lotion</li>
    <li> I really like this aftershave. It has a unique smell and it lasts a long time. It also does a pretty good job as far as stopping razor burn and cleaning out any cuts.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for that great old time barbershop smell, this is what you want. It also works very well. I like the smell so much sometimes I just splash a bit on my face even when I dont shave. You owe it to yourself to try this once. You wont regret it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27; t like the scent too much. That&#x27;s the risk of ordering online. But my Dad liked it so I gave it to him.</li>
    <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; as I had hoped it would be but it wasn&#x27;t overwhelming either.  It is easier on the skin than most aftershaves.  Would I purchase it again?  Probably not, but the price made it easy to give it a try.</li>
    <li> I was hoping it would have a nice clean smell to it ( maybe like Proraso shaving cream) but to me it smells horrible. Too perfumy and actually gave me a headache. I love the smell of a barbershop but this is not it in my opinion. And no, I do not like Axe products. I do however like Proraso and Bigelow shaving products. Oh well.</li>
    <li> My husband purchased this and loves it. It has a nice, clean, just came from the barber shop scent.</li>
    <li> Love this, a good clean sent. Not for teens, need to have lived a little to enjoy this.</li>
    <li> Nothing makes you feel more like a man than carving up your face with an old fashioned straight razor just before applying this virtual fire to your face.  Seriously, the only way you could increase the sensation would be to use molten lead for aftershave.  I&#x27;ve found this to be an effective way to wake me up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell (which fades fairly early on) and it seems to leave my skin feeling fairly nice after the burning has subsided.</li>
    <li> A aftershave that has been around for well over 200 years. It is a classic Gentleman&#x27;s smell, that reminds me of days gone past. Whether it&#x27;s fishing with Grandpa or learning to shave with Dad. It&#x27;s a smell that is timeless and classic. One that I look forward to sharing with my son when he starts shaving.</li>
    <li> Scent is so subjective, but I didn&#x27;t like the smell of it.  The product coming in a plastic bottle makes it feel cheap too.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Clubman aftershave. If you are old enough to remember going to a man&#x27;s barber shop -- barber pole, straight razor, brush and talc on the back of your neck, old men swapping stories -- then you&#x27;ll love it, too. Clubman is the smell of an old school barber shop. My wife really likes the smell as well. She says it smells like an grown man is supposed to smell.</li>
    <li> Great after shave lotion makes your skin feel fresh.</li>
    <li> If you have to say that this is scent is classic, it means you smell like an old man.  My wife won&#x27;t even come near me until this evaporates.  While I find the odor pleasing and timeless, apparently, it reminds women of their grandfathers.  Does soothe the skin though, and your wife might find the smell of an old guy alluring.</li>
    <li> Wanna be a grown-up?  Throw away the Axe (the ghetto version is spelled &amp;#34;Ask&amp;#34;, BTW) and the multi-blade razor designed by the marketing department, and start shaving the way JFK and Teddy Roosevelt did.  Get a brush, a single-blade double-edge razor (Merkur from Germany is a good place to start), some old school barber shop cream, like Proraso from Italy, and a good aftershave like this one.  Wait til you see how much better it all works.</li>
    <li> Yours will too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean and fresh.. A little tingle when you slap it on let&#x27;s you know that it works.&lt;br /&gt;If you rush a shave and hack your face up this stuff will definitely let you know it and you can work on your technique with it.</li>
    <li> Shave with a safety or straight razor. Then slap on some after shave. Momentarily burns your skin before soothing and giving off a nice smell that doesn&#x27;t linger too long.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking to smell like a stereotype or find that throw-back smell to go with your costume for your buddy&#x27;s 90s party (rounding out that outfit of parachute pants), this is your product.  It&#x27;s cheap; it smells like cheap; and it smells STRONGLY of cheap.  Be aware, you cannot return this due to Amazon&#x27;s policy about hazardous/flammable materials (yes, it&#x27;s that powerful).</li>
    <li> The good stuff.  I wish it burned a little more,... I&#x27;m just weird.  I like it to burn after a good shave, lets me know its close.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I grew up in the 60&#x27;s/70&#x27;s going to the barber with my Dad. I got a haircut in the booster seat and he got a haircut and straight razor shave. The barber always ended his shave with a huge dose of Pinaud Clubman from the industrial size bottle on the counter. I bought this for the nostalgia and ended up using it after every shave. I love the way it feels and smells. My wife really likes it too. My oldest son started wet shaving using mystuff and loves this stuff. He actually started wet shaving because of Clubman. I guess some things just never go out of style. His frat at college is now getting into wet shaving and Clubmam is theirfavorite aftershave.Maybe I&#x27;ll try the straight razor next?</li>
    <li> The mens club in our town carries this along with several other after shaves and this one stands out.  Immediately after applying it, I was transported back to barber shops with straight edge razors and combs soaking in blue barbicide.  Fantastic scent!!  Not overpowering, but subtle - not flowerly, but a man&#x27;s scent.  Confident, clear and comfortable.  I had stopped wearing after shave as my wife never liked anything I had tried previously.  But one day after work she hugged me and smelled the aftershave and said aloud how much she liked it.  So, I&#x27;ve become a big fan and have bought the cologne as well as Pinaud&#x27;s Vanilla scent.  Both of those are great too, but this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> great fragrance, this will be my second bottle, I use this as aftershave and to freshen up in the morning</li>
    <li> I love Clubman Pinaud After Shave. It makes me feel like a man. The minute I put it on a get an exciting tingle all over my body and I feel like the Hulk. My wife and husband both tell me I smell great and when we go to swingers parties I am the first one chosen. Thanks Clubman!</li>
    <li> Just as my title states, this is a true manly scent. This is how my grandfather used to smell and this aftershave brought back some good memories of my childhood. I would say that this is a sure shot with the ladies, otherwise we wouldn&#x27;t be here today ;)</li>
    <li> While merely holding this bottle to pay for it, I impregnated the lady at the cash register when her eyes met mine.</li>
    <li> Today I decided to grow up and get a real man&#x27;s haircut in lieu of one that requires gel.  I coach a college rugby team.  When I arrived at practice, the players complimented my haircut.  I bought a bottle of this the day I received the best haircut of my life.  When a rugby team tells you that you look and smell like a man, you look and smell like a man.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of classic aftershaves, but clubman has helped me to realize that I don&#x27;t like sweet, powdery, and floral scents. The nice things that I can say about Clubman are that it is good for your skin, and the price is very affordable. However, the smell is so strong that it&#x27;s just flat out overpowering, gaudy, and too flowery in my opinion. I even tried cutting it 50-50 with witch hazel, and that was better but it still gave me a headache after a few hours. This is one of those aftershaves that has the ability to flat out offend other people, so be careful with it. I&#x27;d prefer a nice bottle of bay rum or mentholated aftershave over this any day.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, classically manly-smelling aftershave.  It smells very similar to, and nicely complements, the Clubman Pinaud talc.  I would say it&#x27;s a pretty good value at this price point.  It is one of several scents that remind me of barbershops (another is [[ASIN:B001711FMI Clubman Jeris Osage Rub, 14 Fluid Ounce]], which probably produces the most intense cooling sensation you can get without placing your face into ice water).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, here is a word of advice to anyone who is new to old-school wetshaving: if you really want to reduce skin irritation after shaving with a blade, don&#x27;t use this, or any other alcohol-based aftershave.  You want a glycerin-based product.  My favorite is George F. Trumper brand \\&quot;skin food\\&quot; (especially this one: [[ASIN:B0007M3ZKI Geo F. Trumper Limes Skin Food, 100ml]]).  These products cost a bit more, but are dramatically better at soothing your skin after shaving.  Any alcohol-based \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; will sting, and something like the Trumper skin food does not (it&#x27;s actually so soothing I occasionally use it on the patches of eczema I develop on my arms in the driest part of winter).  If you shave with a brush, good shaving cream or soap (NOT FOAM OR GEL FROM A CAN, but something from a tube or tub, of which there are numerous options), and a good blade (honestly, old-school double-edged safety razors are far superior to so-called \\&quot;modern\\&quot; cartridge razors), and if you use skin food afterward, you&#x27;ll get the best shave possible.  With that strategy, and by shaving in the shower with lots of hot water, I can get a shave that is even better than a barbershop straight-razor shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the actual product being reviewed, though--if your skin isn&#x27;t significantly irritated, or if you&#x27;re really going to use aftershave as a cologne, not applying it right after shaving, this is a nice option.  It&#x27;s pleasant, but not overly strong, and in the proper context I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> Clubman Pinaud After Shave Lotion, 6 Ounce&lt;br /&gt;nice feels after you use it. Doesn&#x27;t dry the skin, and feels very smooth after. Best aftershave in my opinion.Smells nice too</li>
    <li> Nice scent, but very, very faint scent. That can be a good thing if you need to be low key, but no one will smell it unless they, ummmm, lick you.</li>
    <li> After reading all of the positive reviews I needed to give Clubman Pinaud aftershave a try.  It is inexpensive but has a good scent that holds up well, is not overpowering, and makes you smell fresh and clean.  You will smell like you just came out of an old barbershop.  Those men who are 50 and older will know what I mean.  I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and will definitely continue to use it after shaving.</li>
    <li> This is my second time buying this product, and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed. It smells fantastic, even to my girlfriend, and it helps my hair grow in faster and fuller. As a bonus, it&#x27;s helped my complexion. Wonderful.</li>
    <li> I wanted to give Clubman by Pinaud 5 stars, but I just can&#x27;t. As an everyday aftershave, this does the job and goes easy on the wallet. Its scent comes too close to \\&quot;old man\\&quot; for my taste, though. A bit too sweet.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic. Smells great. The ladies notice it and ask what it is. Perfect for smelling fresh for quite a while.</li>
    <li> Reminds me of the old days when we went to a barber for hair cut. Teamed&lt;br /&gt;up with the JERIS talc powder completes the experience.</li>
    <li> Yeah this is going to smell exactly as you imagine it will. I bought some of the &#x27;classic&#x27; aftershaves to use after I shave, which is at home in the evening when nobody else can smell me but I need something on my face. It&#x27;s fun, it will make you smell like Grandpa. You may even wear it out, assuming you&#x27;re either a married man or out with your pals on a bowling night.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat this for the price. My wife says it smells &amp;#34;pretty good, but not great&amp;#34;. I guess greatness costs 5 or 10 times more. The scent seems to be something that could suit almost anyone, but probably wouldn&#x27;t be a great fit for some. A professional doctor or lawyer would likely be happier with something from an upscale dept store. A lumberjack would probably want something more manly. A teenager would want something called Axe (no connection to the lumberjack). But this is a good scent for the average guy or practically anyone else on a casual, weekend / vacation.</li>
    <li> I wear grea cologne for my job, but just hanging out at home or on weekends, this is cheaper, npretentious, relaxed and smells very good. My wife loves it. You get a vat for $5!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not just that, it signifies to me that I am not &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; .....not working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like well worn cargo shorts And a teeshirt ..........down time......</li>
    <li> I used this aftershave for the first time today when i purchased it with a single bladed razor and some other products for a new shaving regimen. I swear i had a couple older women linger stares after coming close by. They were kinda hot though. Not sure if i&#x27;m old enough for this smell lol. I like it though.</li>
    <li> Great scent that has staying power. It&#x27;s a grown man&#x27;s scent. It&#x27;s not a scent you&#x27;d use trolling for hotties; rather a scent that says, \\&quot;I&#x27;m an adult who is serious about my daily grooming routine.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s how to work it. Finish your shave with a cold water rinse (and for God&#x27;s sake use a brush and a quality shave soap! Proraso and Colonel Conk make wonderful, very affordable soaps.) While your face is a bit wet, put 2 shakes of the lotion in the palm of your hand and gently apply to face and neck. If you get a bracing sting, it means you over-cooked your shave. Lighten up on the pressure next time. You&#x27;ll find the lotion dries down nicely leaving your face toned and smooth...and smelling like a new haircut in the North Bronx back in 1955. Great product.</li>
    <li> Outstanding smell and superior feel after shave with DE razor.  Go easy to prevent sexual harassment lawsuits.  Alternate with proraso balm for variety.</li>
    <li> I gave it 5 stars, The memories are instant. My wife and her friend love the aroma, great buy a must.</li>
    <li> A Grown man After Shave!!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! Yes it smells like the barber shop your dad or granddad took you to when you were a kid. IMO that&#x27;s not a bad thing. Sorry I like aftershave that has manly smell not sweet like others I&#x27;ve used. There are lot of comments regarding the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34;. To this I will say if you&#x27;ve been using a lotion or skin conditioner type aftershave then yes there will be a burn if you&#x27;ve been using an alcohol containing aftershave then this is no worse then what you&#x27;ve been using.</li>
    <li> My Father and Myself love this old fashioned lotion.  Takes me back to my childhood days of that smell you could only find in a barbershop.  Smells great and feels great when patting it on.</li>
    <li> This is the scent I&#x27;ve been looking for!  It does not even come close to the boyish commercial perfumes they call mens aftershave today. Now many on here claim this stuff burn like lava. Nonsense! Absolutely false. The first time I splashed this on my face the thought that came to mind was I possibly just stuck my face into a hornets nest! Or maybe I had touched a live electrical wire to my face!  It leaves the skin tight and firm and the smell is not overpowering. The wife loves it too! I&#x27;ll be using this forever.</li>
    <li> I love the feel on my face when I splash it on.  And the smell is great, brings back memories of watching my grandpa shave.</li>
    <li> Look no further than Clubman&#x27;s Pinaud After Shave Lotion to attract cougars.  Buyer be warned: will attract cougars and those who had questionable relationships with their fathers.</li>
    <li> All synthetic, nothing natural god forbid they use natural stuff, its too expensive, they rather put this mess on our skin</li>
    <li> My husband and I discovered this aftershave many, many years ago. It has this great smell that can be worn by either gender! Sounds nuts, but we both really like the way it smells.</li>
    <li> Perfect for after a shave. I&#x27;ll be getting more when my current bottle runs out. Just make sure to put some lotion on your face after using this!</li>
    <li> Classic scent in a soothing aftershave for a very reasonable price. I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
    <li> Not much more to say that hasn&#x27;t already been said about this awesome aftershave.  I use this stuff almost daily and splash it on my body, neck, arms and face liberally.  I love the smell which is somewhere between, or a combination of barber shop, baby powder, and Dapper Dan.  I personally don&#x27;t find the smell overpowering like some have mentioned, but rather the right balance between being able to give off a nice smell that isn&#x27;t too strong, and at the same time doesn&#x27;t vanish as the day goes by.  Remember that time you were somewhere, and someone smelt great, but you couldn&#x27;t figure out who, or where it was coming from?  It didn&#x27;t smell like a cologne, but at the same time it was more than just the soap they used that morning, highly likely it was this stuff.</li>
    <li> After years of smelling this aroma at my barber shop for years I finally ask the guys what after shave they have been using and to my surprise it was clubman. One of the oldest after shaves in the world. It&#x27;s time for men to smell like men again.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic. It smells like class and makes my face smoother and softer than some wood that has just been finished with 800 grit sandpaper. I have sensitive skin and it never fails to sooth after i shave. A great product for everyone that shaves!</li>
    <li> cmon anyone remember this as  young kid at the barber shop, its the greatest</li>
    <li> This thing is even better than colon seriously !! When you line up someone or Razor them up just finish the of with some after shave and it&#x27;ll give the a little sting with a great smell</li>
    <li> Great,Classic smell. try it. Strong at first. Takes a few hours to wear off so it&#x27;s not so strong. Smells like the kind your grandpa had.</li>
    <li> Great smell. Manly.  Reminds you of the barber,</li>
    <li> My husband and his father have always used the brand.  It is not always easy to find in our town so I was happy to be able to order it online.  My husband is 80 and would not like a change in aftershave lotion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always hated shaving because of the shave bumps, skin burns and itchy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;But with this product, this doesn&#x27;t happen to me anymore.&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend also loves the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 5 star but gave it 4 because this &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t keep my skin moisturized. My skin ends up drying up just a little and i would have to apply my own moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. What more can I say?</li>
    <li> Just A Quick Note:  I Really Like This Clubman Aftershave.  The Scent is really good and &#x27;CLASSY&#x27; while not overpowering yet it isn&#x27;t completely gone after say 20 mins outside.  So I use it in the evenings or when I take a girlfriend out to dinner.  For my main or Daytime after shave I Use/Prefer Clubman Special Reserve but that is a Strong/Overpowering scent which may not always be appropriate in all situations tho it will stay with you all day long.  Now the regular scent which we are talking about here is more balanced and better used in those touchy &#x27;Social Situations!&#x27; as I like to use this together with a dash of Eau De Quinine hair tonic if I need a dash of something just a bit stronger and have been complimented by ladies many times.  So for those delicate situations where you need a good but moderate After Shave then this is the one.  Nuff Said.  Indiana ED</li>
    <li> I have been tring different old aftershaves lately. Ogallala Bay rum which I really like,although, it is heavy on the cinniman, Dominica Original Bay Rum. It has a nice old scent but not sure how much I like it. Gold Dachs: seams to be a good toner. I like it but a little light on the scent for me. Well today I went to Walgreens and bought 6 oz of Pinaud Clubman aftershave. I think this may be my best so far as scent. Anyway, Im sure I will be buying more of this Clubman.</li>
    <li> This is a scent that says \\&quot;I&#x27;ve been a man longer than you have been alive!\\&quot;  Classic, well groomed, fresh from the barbershop scent.  Leaves your face feeling smooth and soothed.  Perfect for after using a double edged safety razor - and if you&#x27;re not, you should.  Why spend dollars per cartridge when you could spend pennies per blade and get a smoother shave?</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews about Clubman Pinaud smelling like the barber shops of old I decided to give it a try. I will admit it brought back memories of straight razors and hot lather. Smells great, everything I was hopping for.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this, I gave it to my boyfriend as a gift, he said he likes it, and I just love them smell so classy</li>
    <li> This is classic slash on shave lotion - I love the aroma.</li>
    <li> I never fail to get compliments when I wear Clubman.</li>
    <li> Got it for the boyfriend and I love the smell so it&#x27;s a done deal. As a plus, he says it&#x27;s good for the skin too. He says it helps with the irritations of shaving. I wouldn&#x27;t know. Didn&#x27;t use it myself personally.</li>
    <li> I love this classic sent that wakes up and softens your skin after a wet shave.  The sent will transport you back in time to trips to your neighbor barber shop with your dad.  It is alcohol based so you&#x27;ll know where you were a little too aggressive.  My skin is a bit on the oily side this seems to help my skin a lot with that problem.  I have used it after electric razor use as well.</li>
    <li> really nice smell and good price</li>
    <li> Holy Molly, I am a man now</li>
    <li> Smell was pungent that mild.&lt;br /&gt;Didnt use it much.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells to high heaven and burns like hell. It does a marginal job of relieving razor burn, which is its basic function, but nothing else about it is any good. I switched to an unscented aftershave lotion and haven&#x27;t looked back since.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the smell.  Seriously, there is nothing I have found that comes close. Ofcourse, smell is objective, but most people I know enjoy the smell and I have recived compliments on it.  Unfortunately, the the fragrance does not last very long.  It&#x27;s pretty much completely gone after an hour.  I do like the feel of splashing this on my face, but it leaves my face feeling dry.  I wish there was a cologne with this scent, because I really do love it, but it&#x27;s just not that effective as an aftershave.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I mix it with witch hazel and some lotion to make a really nice aftershave balm.  The scent is perfect that way - not too strong.</li>
    <li> Cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Works.&lt;br /&gt;Makes you smell like a man.&lt;br /&gt;Will rebuy.</li>
    <li> I was able to find it at my local cvs. I agree with the reviews about it having that classic smell to it. It has a fresh crips smell to it. I am 31 and was worried about smelling like an old man, but tonight I went out with some friends and one of my friends who is a girl complimented me on how good I smell so I am sold. Great smell and my skin feels refreshed .</li>
    <li> Smells good but not overpowering and does the job. For the price, this is a must have. Will buy in the future.</li>
    <li> Smells like what my grandfather used to wear--- 30 years ago.  I like the way is stings a little and tones my face.  I&#x27;m pretty sure that this also clogs up nicks and dings I tend to make when I cut myself shaving.</li>
    <li> This aftershave feels really nice on my skin, however the scent just isn&#x27;t for me. It has a powdery scent similar to barber&#x27;s talc which some people may like, but which smells too old-fashioned for me.</li>
    <li> This is way too strong a fragrance.  Smells like a cologne a 15 year old boy would pour all over himself.</li>
    <li> Have you ever been to a barbershop?  That&#x27;s a rhetorical question.  Of course you have, or you wouldn&#x27;t be looking to purchase a fine product like this.  Now close your eyes and think about how good you feel with a fresh haircut and that glorious barbershop smell permeating your nostrils as you stroll out the door.  That smell, the unofficial smell of barbershops everywhere, is Pinaud Clubman.    It smells fresh and clean with slight scent of baby powder.  Not too overpowering, but enough to let people know you&#x27;re a man who&#x27;s going places.  Use it as an aftershave, use it as a cologne.  Heck, splash some on midday so you can feel alive again.    Overall a great scent and for $6 a bottle you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> It really does take care of those inevitable shaving nicks with out too much stinging. Nice smell, very masculine.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have time to write a review of this after shave. Too many women are now requiring it. Quit reading this and buy some.</li>
    <li> It smells great on me, my wife, children, staff, and customers have commented on how nice it smells. It does seem to last all day.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment and now all the older ladies keep sniffing around .......lol</li>
    <li> The smell of the Pinaud After Shave is reminiscent of my grandfather. I&#x27;m not sure that he used this particular product, but the smell is definitely similar. I was very close to my grandfather, so anything that reminds me of him is wonderful.</li>
    <li> When I first got this product I was surprised at how large the bottle was. I thought it was going to be this tiny little thing, but it is quite large about the size of a stick deodorant. It smells great and gets the job done! It&#x27;s recommended to only use a small amount so it seems like this bottle will last me quite some time!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Clubman Pinaud \\&quot;regular\\&quot; scent. This stuff goes on great and leaves my face feeling completely refreshed after my daily DE shave. The scent is great, too, not too overpowering and it lingers all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other Clubman scents but keep coming back to this one. The Vanilla is the only other one that comes close.</li>
    <li> very satisfied with this purchase</li>
    <li> Buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> It smells OK. It&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a suggestion from the Art of Manliness, I had no idea how it would smell but I trusted the reviews on Amazon. Boy, am I glad I listened! This is the best smelling and feeling after shave that I have ever used. It leaves you smelling great and feeling refreshed, especially after using a DE razor! Don&#x27;t hesitate, there is a reason why the classics last forever...they are just awesome!</li>
    <li> Pardon the Old Spice reference, but I had to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll really enjoy using this because of the &amp;#34;just came from the barbershop&amp;#34; smell. There really isn&#x27;t much else to say, and I don&#x27;t want to take away from Dr. StrangeBrew&#x27;s thunder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll smell like a man&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More or less impossible to find in big box stores in the NYC area as far as I know.</li>
    <li> Functionally, it works well as as aftershave. However, the smell is just too strong. To finish off the bottle, I had to start washing my face after applying it to get rid of the smell. I would recommend an unscented product - possibly take a look at Witch Hazel as a substitute.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this. This is the genuine smell I remember from the barbershops as a kid back in the 50s when I went with my dad. I was in line today at the supermarket and a woman behind me commented on how nice the aroma was. Don&#x27;t overdo it. Just a quick splash in wet hands and apply to face. It&#x27;s been 8 hours since I applied it and it still smells great.</li>
    <li> This is a great after shave.  It is alcohol-based, so it really wakes you up after shaving.  The scent is quite dapper and reminds me of an old barber shop.  For the price, you can&#x27;t beat Clubman Pinaud.</li>
    <li> always did love the smell of this after shave.</li>
    <li> Good, clean feel and smell; doesn&#x27;t overpower the room, but my wife likes it.  Reasonably priced, given the small amount you have to use.  Manly, but doesn&#x27;t make you smell like a perfumed bear.  I&#x27;ll probably buy another bottle.</li>
    <li> It smells great and the product can be seen in many barber shops. I&#x27;ve been using it for my customers after all straight razor shaves, but I think I&#x27;m going to switch it up for the my next after shave purchase. I suspect this product has a high level of alcohol which is great for killing bacteria, but the sting irritates some of the customers. Some of the other barbers I work with have been using other high end products which does a better job at soothing freshly shaved skin without the sting.</li>
    <li> came busted open but still useable.  When i opened the box it got all over my hands and my wife and i reenacted the Anchorman cologne scene the rest of the night.  We ended up putting it in a ziplock and trowing it out didn&#x27;t particularly care for the scent</li>
    <li> Have you ever just finished shaving a craved the hellfire burn of cleanliness? This will do that. Don&#x27;t be fool by the smell at the bottle, when applied it is quite fragrant but does however feel that it has conditioned your skin. I personally use it after shaving before bed so I don&#x27;t have to go out in public with it on. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it does smell good but in public it may have people mistaking your swag as cheap vegas gambler which is clearly not the case. You are a gentlemen, a scholar, a clubman, a Clubman Pinaud.</li>
    <li> After the first 10 seconds of burn wears off, youre left feeling refreshed and clean. Plus it smells great - like you just left the barber shop!</li>
    <li> This mix has been the same and perfect since I was a brat in the 60s - 70s.&lt;br /&gt;Loved it as young shaver, still do at 50 years of age this year.&lt;br /&gt;Mahalo.</li>
    <li> This is some potent stuff. If you were to wear this stuff at work you would probably be accussed of sexual harassment as soon as you walked into a room. I would picture Ron Burgundy wearing this stuff if sex panther didn&#x27;t work every time.</li>
    <li> If you are a gentleman that is worthy of a top hat and cane, if you can hold a monocle in wilst bare knuckle boxing a lion, then this is for you. If you say bro, tight, or take selfies, get some axe body spray you arent worthy. Pinaud smells great and is a throw back to an era when daper was standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this stuff, its incredible.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find the fragnance as strong as it has been made in the reviews. Classic and lasts long. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I have been testing out different after shave rubs for a couple for months now, and I have really enjoyed the invigorating feel of the Clubman Pinaud after a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a great manly scent, and a nice feel that does not leave me feeling dry.  It also does a nice job at staunching blood flow of those nasty nicks that happen from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I will still test other after shave rubs, I know I can always return to Clubman!</li>
    <li> The only after shave I have really used. The purpose of an aftershave seems two-fold, one as a mild astringent and two for the aroma. I like this product.</li>
    <li> well before he got put in the home and lost control of his bodily functions any way.  This stuff is awesome smells like you want to remember grandpa smelling,  not like the urine and bm he reeked of at the end.  This is the happy memories thank god.</li>
    <li> Lots of joke review on this, it seems...  This is an actual review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product works fine as an aftershave if you like alcohol.  It&#x27;s not overly &#x27;hot&#x27; from the alcohol, and does a decent job of soothing after a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell, however, is very strange.  Actually, it smells a lot like geraniums, that usually-red flower, but they (like the aftershave) don&#x27;t smell flowery at all.  Instead, it&#x27;s more like a cleaning product or an herbal/natural bug repellant.  Nobody would smell this and think of cologne or aftershave; it&#x27;s not even in that ballpark.  It&#x27;s not an *unpleasant* smell, but I&#x27;m left asking myself why I&#x27;d want to smell like this on purpose.</li>
    <li> Ready for my 5 star review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;It smells like I just left a barbershop with a fresh cut aka Pinaud&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might have to start a new slang, Pinaud now means &amp;#34;Fresh&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Seen a picture of you in your new car the other day, looking Pinaud!&amp;#34; (Pronounced Pee-No)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Straight Dapper!</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic just like going to the barber vetting a shave and a haircut. Every time I use it my skin feels tighter, I feel sanitary and the little woman lines it!</li>
    <li> Love it! Classic scent. Had compliments on it. Soothing on the skin. Manly scent. People notice it and ask what you are wearing.</li>
    <li> Very Good For me....I like It</li>
    <li> Over the last year or so, I have bought and used five different after shave lotions - Lucky Tiger, Proraso, Pinaud Clubman, and Captain&#x27;s Choice (Bay Rum and Sandalwood). Depending on my mood, I used one or the other, so my comparison has been somewhat continuous. Overall, they are all excellent, however, they are naturally different in various ways, so one&#x27;s taste may cause a preference for one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucky Tiger is the least astringent. You don&#x27;t get that cooling sensation. It&#x27;s probably the most like a skin conditioner. Although its label says &amp;#34;with Aloe Vera&amp;#34;, its other ingredients are not listed. Its aloe vera plus I suspect witch hazel are what make me say it is most like a skin conditioner. I don&#x27;t think it has any alcohol. So if you&#x27;re most concerned about keeping your face smooth and soft over the long run, you might prefer Lucky Tiger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The others all have alcohol and give you that familiar cooling, fresh, astringent sensation. I would say that Pinaud Clubman is the most astringent and cooling, followed by Proraso, Clubman&#x27;s Bay Rum, and Clubman&#x27;s Sandalwood. It&#x27;s hard to say there is a difference between the two Clubman&#x27;s varieties. The coolness of Proraso is minty and lingers a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t believe in giving a product a poor review because it doesn&#x27;t meet a personal preference (for example scent or astringency in an after shave). Therefore, I would rate them all as five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My preference is Pinaud Clubman because I like a cool feeling on my face after a shave. Also, when an after shave causes any razor burns and minor cuts to sting, I feel like I am doing something positive to treat them, even if another after shave might help them heal better without your feeling anything. Lack of stinging indicates fewer burns and cuts meaning that I&#x27;ve given myself a good shave. So, the more astringency the better for me. As a bonus, Pinaud Clubman is the lowest cost.</li>
    <li> Just wish that I had started using Pinaud forty years ago.</li>
    <li> Smells OK, but wife did not care for it.</li>
    <li> Someone here called it the Pabst Blue Ribbon of aftershave and I had to laugh. Yes, it has what some might consider elusive appeal. Also, I don&#x27;t think the plastic bottle does it any favors, as if it might interact with the after shave. In any case, the initial blast of aroma is not pleasant for me but the scent does open up within minutes and has slowly but surely become one of the favorites in my medicine cabinet. The nostalgia that goes along with its old-timey scent is a bonus.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best after shave I have ever used. After battling razor burn for years, I found a product that soothes and heals after shaving. I no longer have razor burn and I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells wonderful. My wife loves it. Anyone who smells it compliments me. However, it gets 4/5 stars because this stuff is not for the faint-hearted. It WILL make your face burn. A lot. So if you have sensitive skin be warned. It will cause you some pain. But it will also make you the best smelling person in any room you enter. No pain, no gain.</li>
    <li> I love the smell, more importantly, my girlfriend LOVES it too.  First time I used it, she came home afterwork and just said &amp;#34;WOW you smell great!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair but sometimes I have these small red pimples due to infection after shaving.  I thought I should use something to help cleaning up.  So far it&#x27;s been working out great.  It does burn but it&#x27;s not too much -- it does make it feel more &amp;#34;machos&amp;#34; in a way...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it.  Classy.</li>
    <li> Works great and smells good</li>
    <li> I use the expensive Drakkar after shave but it is quite expensive.  I tried this based on many positive reviews and found that my wife thinks it is as good an aroma as the more expensive Drakkar.  Fast shipping.  Great value.  Try it.  You&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> Smell like a man, not a pansy. This stuff is superb.</li>
    <li> Fantastic smell. Roommate commented that it smells like his grandfather did. Will definitely buy again with this superb price.</li>
    <li> Ladies will swoon over you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Men will envy you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will smell like you just stepped out of an old timey barbershop where Clarence gave you a close shave and a hot towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Real men know that slapping alcohol right on your freshly shaved skin is what you are suppose to do, none of that moisturizing stuff here son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be surprised if the ladies notice your smell before your three wolf moon t-shirt aura.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is the real deal.</li>
    <li> My husband has been wearing Clubman for awhile now. I love this scent and now think of him whenever I smell it. It&#x27;s a very classic scent. It&#x27;s not over-powering or too strong. It leaves a nice scent on his skin. I can still smell it hours later. Great price on amazon too! Love it!</li>
    <li> This aftershave will test your manhood when applied... lesser men will scream like a baby and call out for their mamma.  Then it will feel good, real good.  I shave my head and neck with a straight razor and a good splashing of this will leave you ready for the day.  I personally LOVE the scent and find it does not dry out my skin.  I also use a cream style aftershave on top of this to soften skin sometimes.  Good stuff, good scent.</li>
    <li> I thought i knew what this smells like but i was so wrong.&lt;br /&gt;It smells like the cheapest Colon i have ever smelled and burns like acid</li>
    <li> The classic.  This stuff smells great.  Much like the other reviews- definite old time barber shop feel.  It&#x27;s refreshing and invigorates in the morning.  Even though it&#x27;s fairly heavy in alcohol, it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.  I could see it having some zings if you have sensitive skin or are prone to nicking yourself.</li>
    <li> A tip for the single guy&#x27;s, women do love this. I keep bottle of it, put it on a cotton ball, and suck it into the vacuum cleaner. Devine. Another one I recommend is RSVP.</li>
    <li> I have been using [[ASIN:B0017WNSBS Lucky Tiger After Shave and Face Tonic, 8 Ounce]] for a year or so and ran out.  Amazon is offering this Clubman Pinaud on the \\&quot;add-on\\&quot; program for free shipping with other items so I thought I would give it a try based on the reviews.  Wow! I feel like I was slapped in the face a couple times... and the smell is still overwhelming after 20 minutes.  I am not a fan of the smell - a little more masculine than baby powder but definitely has a hint of it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t walk down the street without being harassed by buxom young filly&#x27;s. this stuff is like stripper catnip</li>
    <li> If you loved the smell of aftershave in an old time barber shop; this is it.</li>
    <li> Hits your face like a hundred angry hornets and leaves you smelling like a real man. World&#x27;s best aftershave.</li>
    <li> Small bottle. I was looking for a bigger bottle. Nice smell, I&#x27;ll always use this same brand and smell. It give a person a sense of a fresh new haircut after having one.</li>
    <li> great product use always</li>
    <li> Not Hugo Boss, nor Givenchy, nor Armani (which I also use), Clubman kicks all the others out of the park. At $4 a bottle its a joke if it wasn&#x27;t so serious. This is for truth seekers not wannabes. People who can appreciate good smell beyond the price tag.  I would describe the smell as masculine yes, at the same time inviting and accessible. It does smell like the essence of all other aftershaves. Like Latin underlying English. I like it not just for what it does for others but for me. So much so that I sometimes put it on before I go to sleep just to feel good with myself. Weird.  It is rare in life to get the best product at the cheapest price. This is that one in a hundred product.</li>
    <li> Smells great and really prevents razor burn. First few seconds burn a little so it&#x27;s not for sissies.</li>
    <li> I like it, but I don&#x27;t love it. As my first aftershave, I will probably explore other options to decide whether or not I like Clubman.</li>
    <li> Ordered third time really like it. Good smell.</li>
    <li> I am a middle aged man that wanted something way off track from all the &amp;#34;Extreme Sport/Waterfall/Energy&amp;#34; smelling crap.  When I opened it I was instantly reminded of the smell of going to the barber with my father decades ago.  A great, clean, lasting scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I wore it, my girlfriend said it makes her want to take her panties off which is all that really matters in an aftershave, so I&#x27;ll just leave it at that and give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve ever walked into a barber shop, you know what I&#x27;m talking about. It&#x27;s definitely an old man smell, but in the best way. There really is no middle ground on this stuff. You either love it or you hate it. I love it!</li>
    <li> Simply put,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on, my girlfriend loves it, good things come of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, it smells straight up awesome, the burn makes you feel like a man. Makes you miss the good ol&#x27; days.</li>
    <li> this is awesome product. I have used so many high priced after shave lotions and this one simply beats all off them on price and quality front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product. Once you try this you will not go back to any other brand.</li>
    <li> Want to smell as badass as a 1950&#x27;s barbershop?  this is your stuff!  This is a fantastic manly smell, that will be sure to turn heads and give any woman that hint of their father or grandfather smell.....</li>
    <li> Have you ever wondered what it would feel like to rinse your face with pure awesomeness? I have and Clubman Pinaud After Shave Lotion is the answer! Do you need coffee in the morning to wake up? Not after using this you won&#x27;t because splashing it onto your face after a fresh shave fills each and everyone of your pores and cuts with little lemon squeezing ninjas who infuse a painful level of awesome into your morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are tired of using Axe and smelling like you just came back from an encore performance of the last Justin Bieber concert then you need this aftershave. THIS IS THE SENT OF PURE MAN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many complain that the bottle is too small, and I would agree because I would bathe in this product if that were not illegal in all 50 states.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The secret in the manufacturing process is rather amazing. Some believe that, and this is open for debate, that Chuck Norris cried one single tear in the distant past which was obviously the cause for the Big Bang.  NASA and DARPA scientists collected an ancient frozen sample of this tear and found a way to replicate it in the lab. Clubman Pinaud is literally the purest form of Chuck Norris&#x27; tears known to man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some side effects in using this product on a regular basis, the #1 being the excessive hordes of women that you will be fending off upon leaving your house each morning. The second thing is that every time you open the bottle the lights go out and a beam of light shines down upon the bottle and angels begin to sing, which is not a problem for me however it wakes my wife up each morning and she is becoming frustrated, luckily once she smells my beautiful manly musk all is instantly forgiven!. The third is that the unicorn that appeared after my first bottle won&#x27;t go away and he makes quite a mess in the apartment. Apart from that there is no reason you should not buy this!</li>
    <li> Clubman is old school. Great product. The price was right. I keep a bottle and use after each shave. It&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not an old timer but there&#x27;s something about this smell that grows on you. A spicy and musky scent that goes well after a wet shave and lasts for a while. Good product for the price. It&#x27;s been around since the 1800&#x27;s so you can tell it&#x27;s a classic.</li>
    <li> This aftershave is very good, but be warned: This is not for wimps. The alcohol content is very high, and just by smelling it you can tell how powerful it is.</li>
    <li> Great scent.  Love the sting of a nice alcohol based after shave in the morning - smells like VICTORY! :)</li>
    <li> It is an ok aftershave, and quite frankly, it is not something I&#x27;ll buy again. It was a &amp;#34;trial&amp;#34; purchase having used Clubman products before &amp; liked them.</li>
    <li> Reminds me of &amp;#34;Tony&#x27;s Barber Shop&amp;#34; when I was a kid.  The chatter.  The newspapers.  The ball games on the radio.  It&#x27;s all here.</li>
    <li> I use a DE safety razor and shave my head and face every day. I have tried a number of products and think I may have found a keeper. Love the smell. For the price what is the risk. Wife says she likes it better than the Proraso. Nice lingering smell.</li>
    <li> My first experience with Pinaud was in the barber shop, when my barber used Pinaud talcum powder after cutting my hair.  I thought it was a good product, which convinced me to buy this aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent- It does contain alcohol, but it didn&#x27;t make the scent too strong.  The scent can last a couple hours after application, but if that is not to your liking, you can apply a little water to rinse away the excess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effect- My face feels smoother and cleaner after I apply a splash of this aftershave.  It cleans out my pores before I apply some cold water to close them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with this product, and I will look into more Pinaud products because of it.</li>
    <li> So this is the original After shave lotion!!  Goes on kinda strong, but it mellows out a bit and stays for quite a few hours.  Would highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Great scent, seals up minor cuts quickly. Smells like an old timey barber shop. I also bought the talc which has the same scent, so they pair well together.</li>
    <li> Am I the only person here who thinks this stuff smells just like Old Spice? Although I don&#x27;t have anything against Old Spice (it kind of reminds me of my dad), I think we should call it what it is. Maybe I will try the vanilla and lime scents.</li>
    <li> I just rediscovered Pinaud Clubman, and was instantly transported back to the barber&#x27;s of my youth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the fresh, clean, powdery scent.  Wish it came in an EDT or EDC - but according to Pinaud (I wrote them to ask) it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cannot believe such a great scent exists at this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are on the fence, just roll the dice - the beauty of Pinaud&#x27;s Clubman is that even if you are in the &lt;1% of people it doesn&#x27;t call to, you&#x27;ll only be out a couple of bucks.  You can give it away if you don&#x27;t like it (but you won&#x27;t, because you&#x27;ll probably like it).</li>
    <li> It is good. But it does smell like old rusted hotel on top of mountain where old people come for vacations with cane holding in their hand to walk. So I recommend it to all, but I am not going to get it again.</li>
    <li> Ever since I was a kid my barber would dust behind my ears and neck after my cut with a sweet smelling talc that was absolutely delicious.  I only recently found that it is available in this aftershave version.  A classic, clean, masculine scent, this aftershave leaves my face feeling smooth and soft.  Highly recommended.  This is one of those timeless scents that will never go out of style.</li>
    <li> this aftershave was exactly what I wanted I would recommended this product to anyone, it is soothing when applied after shaving and smells great</li>
    <li> This a great money and for the price it&#x27;s even more amazing. I don&#x27;t find the smell to be over powering, however, that can differ from person to person. The smell is a pleasant one, so it&#x27;s not bad if it is anyway. Saves a day you don&#x27;t have wear cologne. If you didn&#x27;t have such a smooth shave, you will feel a sting. After applying the aftershave I always apply cold water to close my pores, and that will leave my face feeling tight and uncomfortable. If you find yourself having the same problem, I would recommend you apply some sort of face toner afterwards. It leaves my face cleaner and most, if not all, the tightness goes away. Other than that, this product is great and I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This is a pleasant scent, but not super masculine like Old Spice. I would not recommend it for truck driver or cowboy types unless it&#x27;s Saturday night!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m retired. Used to use this way back in college days and so I figured I&#x27;d try it again. OMG! What memories! Not a lot of sting, the fragrance alone brought back thousands of good memories! I&#x27;ve used it for a week now and even my wife has noticed the difference and loves it! I guess some things are just classic and this is one of them!</li>
    <li> My wife loves the scent, I love the cool old school bottle.</li>
    <li> I remember my old barber, I was too young for  the shave, but remember haircut,  the powder and the tonic, The brush on back of the neck,&lt;br /&gt;The fresh haircut scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only after shave / cologne you really need, without spending 60- 80 - 100? Bucks.&lt;br /&gt;Simple.&lt;br /&gt;Sure, Chanel for men is great,&lt;br /&gt;But clubman pinaud brings back those long past days of barbershops.&lt;br /&gt;Falling asleep with the snip snip snipping sound of scissors and the tickle behind the ear from the buzzing of the shears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush powder on the neck, a splash.&lt;br /&gt;Boy or man, that fresh haircut and a shave feeling is reborn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No worries if you don&#x27;t have to shave, a light splash and people will think you did.</li>
    <li> 5 stars. why? the price, the scent and it&#x27;s not overpowering. Smells a little like Old Spice if you&#x27;re wondering. Apply after shaving will result in a slight burning/warming sensation then it cools. I loved it, will reorder for sure.</li>
    <li> Old school barbershop smell. Comes on strong with a good burn. Does just enough to keep the face moisturized. Scent dries down nicely and hangs around for a few hours.</li>
    <li> Smells like a old time barber shop, women like it too !!!</li>
    <li> I love both the original Clubman Pinaud and Classic Vanilla scent. Perfect compliment to safety razor shaving for the ultimate barber shop shave. Give up those disposable razors!!</li>
    <li> Nice pleasant throw back smell. Feels great after shaving.</li>
    <li> This is aftershave for gentlemen.  The bottle stipulates that it is the same formula from a more civilized time, however the scent doesn&#x27;t remind me of my grandfather as old spice does.  I think it&#x27;s pretty classy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and have not any problems using this product.</li>
    <li> Nice scent good price fast shipping good seller</li>
    <li> Smells ok, just cheap and sweet, but I gave it to my little brother and he was pretty happy.</li>
    <li> I got tried of spraying myself with Ax and Blade so I could smell like a Sea Breeze or a Mountain Spring.  This stuff makes you smell like a man.</li>
    <li> I just bought a Merkur 180 safety razor...best shave of my 42 years of life.  Now I wanted some aftershave.  Well, this stuff had so many 5 star reviews but with such a small price, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.  Surely if it is that cheap it must be horrible.  Wrong! Wrong!  Wow...this stuff is nice.  It really is old school, my wife and kids love it and I can&#x27;t believe how inexpensive it is.  I really wanted Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood but that&#x27;s $40 and I&#x27;m not spending that...how happy I am I took the chance on this!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cheap aftershave that smells like original Old Spice to me. Or some other old man scent. Now for background, I do love the smells of some classic barber shop after shaves and shaving creams but this one isn&#x27;t the one for me.&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, this leaves your face very dry and tight. I tossed it after a week of use.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Best amongst all the after shave lotion I have used so far. So, just go for it,</li>
    <li> A lot of the reviews talked about how great this stuff smells...I couldn&#x27;t disagree more.  At the end of the day this does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, however, in my opinion it&#x27;s not the manliest smell....honestly, it smells a bit like some sort of baby product.  As I&#x27;ve continued using it I&#x27;ve become more and more OK with the smell but when I&#x27;m finished with it I&#x27;m will likely switch back to a bay rum aftershave.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this stuff. it is potent but reminds me of my grand pa. that is cool again now a days. it is just a classic man smell and is a great product for the price. how can you go wrong.</li>
    <li> Want to smell like some cheese-eating high school boy?  Slather on some Axe.  Maybe you want to smell like a Radio Shack sales guy?  Try the Old Spice.  A science teacher limping toward retirement?  Aqua Velva is your scent.  But if you want to smell like a MAN, you need to be using Clubman.  When I say man, I mean Jack Palance, Jack Lord. and Jack Kennedy.  Or Chuck Yeager, Chuck Norris, and Chuck Connors.  Even guys not named Jack or Chuck - I&#x27;m looking at you, Sean Connery.  Sure, Clubman is like a thousand tiny daggers stabbing your face, but it&#x27;s worth it.  I was smart enough to start using this stuff when I was 15, and I still get compliments.  And broads.  Am I going to apologize for calling women &amp;#34;broads&amp;#34;?  Yes, right after I splash on some Clinique For Men Oil Control Exfoliating Tonic.  So never.</li>
    <li> This delightful concoction is to shaving as a fine vintage Cabernet is to French cuisine. If you don&#x27;t get what I&#x27;m trying to convey, I would urge that you stay away from both. For the rest of us, I would suggest indulging in the former and then follow up with the latter. Stay thirsty, gentlemen.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves it, and I get compliments on it everywhere I go.&lt;br /&gt;I chose this after shave because another reviewer said it smelled like a barber shop. I cannot believe such a cheap after-shave has worked out so well for me. Like most after-shaves, though, you will feel the burn when it contacts any cuts or nicks you&#x27;ve given yourself shaving.</li>
    <li> I saw this on Amazon and bought it based on the reviews. I usually use Acqa Velva but love this product and the price is right. Slight burn, refreshing aroma and lasts longer then other after shaves I&#x27;ve used although don&#x27;t confuse it with a cologne.</li>
    <li> Barber shop. Saturday morning. Breakfast afterwards. To be honest, sentimental scent is the only reason I bought this. I use an electric razor and while it rarely nicks or cuts, the slight tingle and smell bring back some great memories.</li>
    <li> I love the &amp;#34;throw back&amp;#34; fragrance and a great value.  The alcohol is a bit harsh on my face, but to use every once in a while is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the .300 Winchester Magnum, the .45ACP of aftershave. Into spear fishing? Crossbow hunting? Scuba diving? Off shore power boat racing? Do you drive a V8 car, an American truck or ride a Harley? Then this s*** is for you. Ruck up and splash it on. But be ready - you&#x27;ll attract all the best kinda chicks with it. Yeah, every read head around and any other nearby broad with \\&quot;daddy issues\\&quot; will start bugging you. So get some .... and get some.</li>
    <li> I love this. I use to break out from shaving, so I have up on it and just let my beard grow. Fast forward years later, and I&#x27;m trying to move up in my company. The beard had to go. I decided to try wet shaving with a safety razor. That shave combined with this after shave is a home run. No bumps, no burn, and my wife loves it.</li>
    <li> Soothing, but has a very strong scent.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for more than 50 years tried all the new ones. this still beats them all.,thats right and all the girls at work still come up to me and say &amp;#34;Oh you smell great what is that cologne that you use.&amp;#34; I tell them if i tell you i have to kill you. and they laugh ! So yeah ! who;s the dummy ?.</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling aftershave on the planet.  It has that olde timey barbershop feel, like you&#x27;re in a black-and-white movie, when men didn&#x27;t wear a t-shirt and blue jeans to every formal event.  If you always want to look like you just got done changing the oil in your car (or if you&#x27;re a metrosexual that waxes his legs), then move on.  This aftershave is for gentlemen only.</li>
    <li> I like the product - I think. The fragrance is strong but decent. I&#x27;m not sure or convinced it helps sooth the skin after a shave. My skin is sensitive and this worked ok but didn&#x27;t wow me. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products to help that after shave feel be more pleasant and this helps but I like the skin food products better for soothing.</li>
    <li> Great product and smell.</li>
    <li> It was a little too old fashion smelling for my hubby, so I kept it for shaving my legs..it has a very nice cooling sensation. And I like the smell of it - very clean smelling.</li>
    <li> i shave with a straight edge, not a safety razor. I shave for the experience not the necessity. I am badass and this is what I use.</li>
    <li> I received this product on time, and I started using them already, so far so good.</li>
    <li> I like the smell, and it makes you comfortable after shaving. At the beginning, the smell is a little strong, but after several times use, i got used to the smell.</li>
    <li> There is only a mild sting. The fragrance lasts all day.  It&#x27;s a old fashioned masculine smell. It does its job in preventing razor burns and any other shaving related blemishes.</li>
    <li> Classic scent.  You can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> It does burn as all the reviews state but its not terrible.  For me the burn is great even with sensitive skin.  The downer to me is the scent lingers all day and it kind of has a powdery tone after a few hours.  I personally prefer the Prorazo product it burns plenty but has other natural soothing elements vs just alcohol and scent.  And the scent on Prorazo is great.  But clubman isn&#x27;t terrible its old school for sure.</li>
    <li> smells pretty nice - sort of like Brut, not as bright but soapier/cleaner scent. Only lasts a little while though. But that&#x27;s to be expected from an aftershave. If you need it to last into the afternoon - get some cologne.</li>
    <li> My Grandfather was a Barber so I might be a tad biased. I do really love this stuff and have not received a negative comment from anyone regarding the aroma, in fact, quite the contrary. Even though this is made by a company that&#x27;s been here for over two-hundred years, it doesn&#x27;t scream &amp;#34;Old Man&amp;#34; after shave. I&#x27;ve even had young guys ask what I&#x27;m wearing because that liked it and were interested in purchasing it for themselves. Even my WIFE really likes it and she&#x27;s really picky about what she likes me wearing.&lt;br /&gt;That just confirmed to me that I was on to a good thing....THANKS CLUBMAN!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my hubby not knowing what it would smell like.  This has a fabulous scent!  Husband says it reminds him of what his dad smelled like when he was growing up!  Brought back wonderful memories.  Hubby&#x27;s scent lingers as he passes through a room when he&#x27;s gotten through shaving.</li>
    <li> I have not used after shave in 20 years, so I am a born again virgin on this product type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clubman After Shave is pleasant in smell, but I must watch how much I use - can be overbearing if you are not careful.  Reminds me of my grandpa, when we went visiting, to me, thats a good thing.  Smells nice, rolls on easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do notice that my post shave routine is soothed by using aftershave to ease the nicks and such.  I have recently switched over to Double Edge safety razor on the toss away multiple head shavers.  The DE Safety razors are very sharp, and nicks now occur, were they were seldom on the duller toss aways.  So a good after shaved seemed a worthy product to try, and it works.  I guess granpa was pretty smart after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why 4 stars, not 5 - I only 5 for truly outstanding products.  This is very good, and recommended.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome after shave.&lt;br /&gt;* great smell.&lt;br /&gt;* wakes you up in the morning .. really strong.&lt;br /&gt;* works on other cuts and bruises too !</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re even looking at the Clubman brand then you are someone who likes to keep it simple. This aftershave has a nice understated fragrance that wont break the bank, Enjoy.</li>
    <li> Love the Pinaud Clubman! Great spicy, alcoholic scent that feels vintage. Plenty of burn after the shave and it lasts quite awhile. I bought a second one to mix in with some unscented shave soap and create Clubman scented shave soap. Get this aftershave!</li>
    <li> Every barber shop I have ever been to has had this on their counter,and you would get slattered after a trim. It&#x27;s still the same if you have ever experienced it.</li>
    <li> I am on a bit of tear, trying all the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; barber shop products. I am trying each product for a day or two, independent of any other products just so I can get feel for each one. I was not aware of Clubman before I found this on Amazon. But now that I have tried it, I recognize the scent. It starts more floral, and then dries to a unique scent that is difficult for me to describe. Maybe woodsy, but not fireplace wood, more like walking through a forest. I think suit and tie when I smell it. But not office suit and tie, more Bond like suit and tie. So, stop pretending with all those overpriced, over-hyped products, and wear the Clubman with the confidence of a Bond villain.</li>
    <li> A pleasantly cooling aftershave with a distinctive scent.  Stronger than your average aftershave and long lasting.</li>
    <li> Anyone that grew up going to the Barbershop  will remember and love this smell. I do like to mix it up between Virgin Island Bay Rum, this, and other more modern colognes.</li>
    <li> Reminds me of the old classic men&#x27;s cologne, Canoe.</li>
    <li> Smells and feels fantastic. Works well on it&#x27;s own or in conjunction with multiple products. I could not be more satisfied. Planning on reordering when I&#x27;m out.</li>
    <li> Good scent, even my wife likes it. Seems that a little bit goes a long way. If I use this I have found that I can not wear cologne because this will definitely overpower your cologne. It does feel refreshing.</li>
    <li> this is the most valuable purchase i&#x27;ve made on amazon. factor in the low price, refreshing feeling, and perfect balance in fragrance and you&#x27;d really have to be something slow to not buy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ladies, do yourself a favor and buy this for that special man. it&#x27;s all win; if you two aren&#x27;t that serious, it&#x27;s a small purchase. if you are, this&#x27;ll certainly place you in the column of keeper.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift…not sure if it&#x27;s good.  Will keep you posted.  The ingredients in the back had a lot of color dye and alcohol.  I am little concerned how this will react on a sensitive acned skin.  I gave it 3 stars for fast shipping and smooth transaction.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! I&#x27;ve noticed that it smells different depending on whether or not I have just showered. This is my every day scent, unique, manly, it smells like nothing else. Love it.</li>
    <li> Holy cow this smells good!!! Its a great aftershave and lasts forever! I will definitely buy again when I run out (not anytime soon).</li>
    <li> Smells great, skin feels pretty good with it.  I haven&#x27;t used too many after shaves to compare it to, but it does the job for me.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell, it&#x27;s strangely masculine. There are subtle notes of A1 steak sauce and citrus. There is a refreshing burn when it covers your shaving nicks. Good price.</li>
    <li> want to smell like a barber shop? here you go, this is the world famous scent. i love it, and it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
    <li> There are tons of aftershaves available. Few have unique, generally enjoyable fragrances that women sill actually compliment on. This, along with the Proraso (100mil green bottle) after shave lotion are two that seem to be universally wonderful and proved a refreshing, yet not overpowering manly smell. For wet shavers, this pairs beautifully with the talcum powder under the same label. Best of all, they&#x27;re very reasonably priced.  I like to keep four different aftershaves on hand; Two logics such as tis and the Proraso and a couple of balms for the colder and dryer winter months. I travel a lot and the Proraso a great fir that because the 100 mil bottle size is TSA approved for carry on. This one&#x27;s too big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even for electric shavers, these are all grape at products. My wide lives the way I smell after saving, and my after shave cocktail hour in the bar never seems to repulse any of the opposite sex dither. Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I&#x27;m a faithful husband, but still enjoy the company of beautiful women after a day at the grind!</li>
    <li> A very nice scent that reminds me of the olde-time barber shop smells when I was a boy, and haircuts were quick, cheap, and easy.</li>
    <li> arrived on time and smells manly. Has a very clean scent and cools the face. I like it. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes my face feel. I also love the retro smell!</li>
    <li> I remember my fathers time. I love it .  Design is nice .  I am thinking new one to be gift for my friends</li>
    <li> As many have written, this is a very traditional barber shop like scent.  It dries to a very \\&quot;powdery\\&quot; scent, which is OK but not my favorite thing.  I also find the scent quite strong; I usually rinse my face a few minutes after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, it gets 4 stars from me, mainly because it works so well as an after shave product.  I&#x27;d never use it as a cologne, but after slathering some on after a shave, my face feels great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different after shaves. Yet, I continue come back to this one. I&#x27;m 21, so it&#x27;s not really a smell many guys my age would care for. But, I find that a lot of girls I&#x27;ve talked say they love it! My barber turned me on to this stuff when he splashed some on me after a shave. I was hooked.  Bottom line: Great, long lasting smell. Wakes you up in the morning, and leaves my skin soft and smooth. What more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> Old school scent, works great, I love it. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a reason why its so cheap.  I wasted 8$.  Smells like root beer, old ladies, diapers, and plastic, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> Works well as an after shave and has a pretty strong scent for an aftershave.  It can pretty much be used as a deodorant/cologne as well.</li>
    <li> I really like all of the scents from Clubman Pinaud&#x27;s line, but hate the alcohol, and harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a quality aftershave that would soothe my burning skin and make me smell nice. I was not expecting this. This product has shown me what true men smell like. Now I crave to shave!</li>
    <li> People say it dries down to a powdery smell, but to me the powdery smell is the initial smell, which goes away thankfully, and leaves the masterpiece behind which lasts a great amount of time by the way</li>
    <li> I like this because my barber used it on me one time. It smells great. Just as the talc smells great too</li>
    <li> At $6 how can you go wrong? You better like the smell, it&#x27;s with you for a while. Feels good without a lot of bite.</li>
    <li> ordering more, love it</li>
    <li> Anyone not familar with the Clubman scent: think barber shop. It is literally the choice of every barber shop in the US. That familiar smell of the barber&#x27;s powder? Clubman. The great thing about Clubman it is incredibly subtle, but very longlasting. It will literally last all day long. Unlike most aftershaves and colognes, you must use soap and water to wash the scent off. If you work construction or some other physical job, this is the product for you. You will smell fresh all day long.</li>
    <li> stuff smells and feels great.  my face tends to get dried out though so I switched to &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Proraso After Shave Balm Protective&amp;#34; as an after shave because I want something the moisturizes my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this aftershave for a while now and what I really like about it is how refreshing the feel and scent is.  It&#x27;s a clear, strong \\&quot;cologney\\&quot; scent that lingers with you (or anyone who gets within an inch of your face) for most of the day - just as it should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now with that said, I remember when I first used it.  Unlike everyone else on here, my first reaction wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;I feel like a real man\\&quot; but it was \\&quot;Yo ladies, check me out - I just turned 21 and now I can drink all by myself - what up ladies?!\\&quot;  :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I mean is that the scent reminded me of when I was in my early 20s and lived with some roommates who were desperately looking for a mate. :)  And no, I&#x27;m not that old (still under 40)!  But I stuck with it and that scent-memory has now been replaced with my own new (happily married with kids) scent-memory.  My wife and kids love the smell of this stuff.  My wife especially - it gives her more of an excuse to \\&quot;get close.\\&quot;  She tells me that she prefers this to any other aftershave I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hmmm... maybe my desperate roommates were onto something after all...</li>
    <li> It smells like baby powder... like liquid baby powder.  I don&#x27;t love it.  Somewhere between, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s okay&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;I like it&amp;#34;.  If I could give 3+1/2 stars I would.  It&#x27;s not worth 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Bottle though as usual is plastic (I have a proraso and old spice both come in good packaging) this stuff smells great and smell is long lasting. Feels very cool after applying this and I must admit, this is something which I don&#x27;t mind replenishing after I finish this. There are very few aftershaves which I really prefer to repeat, this being one of them. The fragrance is one of the highlights. Though I would expect it be in a better packaging which will only add to its value.Therefore one star is reduced from 5 only because of packaging. Rest of the stars go for the fragrance and the cool refreshing feeling it gives after a baby smooth shave. This is something I would recommend one should try atleast once.</li>
    <li> Classic barber shop smell.  Last throughout the day.  I can still smell it after a days work.</li>
    <li> Clubman Pinaud is a classic aftershave. Use this with the Talc after a good shower and shave and you will feel like JD Rockefeller going out for a night on the town. Nothing beats this classic &amp; affordable scent!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s. This smell brings back grandpa memories. Honor your grandpa by wearing this aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;Good product, doesn&#x27;t burn too heavily on skin</li>
    <li> Very strong fragrance and dries out my skin.  But its cheap and practically a rite of passage for every man.</li>
    <li> This after shave burns far more than any other I have ever used, but hey, when the label states it&#x27;s highly flammable, one shouldn&#x27;t be surprised. Great scent as well which seems to carry over to the following day. I can see how they recently celebrated 200 years of business.</li>
    <li> I liked this product but my wife hates it. She said it smells too much like an old man. I&#x27;ll still use it from time to time but be aware that this is a very classic musky smelling aftershave.</li>
    <li> My Dad passed away at a very early age, and this was the cologne he used to wear. I purchased it to remind me of him. It&#x27;s a very nice clean and musky smell.</li>
    <li> there is nothing like having a good shave and then throwing some Clubman on your face. A classic scent for any man</li>
    <li> Barber Shop and Smelling like a real man. Give up that AXE Spray and learn from your grandpa and father. This is what makes babies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not to strong and gives a nice sting after a good close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> Just for fun I bought a sample of this from Garry&#x27;s sample shop.  I was really surprised how much I liked it.  It does have alcohol in it, but it doesn&#x27;t set your face on fire after a shave.  Just enough burn to wake you up.  It works well to stop any minor weepers you might have, and the scent is classic, old school barbershop.  Not overpowering, just nice.  My wife likes it as well.  For the price, give it a shot.  You will likely be surprised as well.</li>
    <li> lasting floral scent. my husband likes it and it reminds me of my Dad. this is really barbershop perfume and it leaves the skin clean and soft.</li>
    <li> There are some people that state they do not like this scent and don&#x27;t even try it on after they get it.  If it smells a bit off to you, tighten the cap and give the bottle a good shake. Give it a smell, put it on and then you will understand why this is a top selling aftershave on Amazon. It will bring back a lot of great barbershop memories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a tough beard and I shave in the shower with a regular shaving cream and a pro-glide.  Once I am finished and out of the shower, I follow up with a splash of this aftershave before I use a waterproof electric razor. (it acts like a pre electric shave and allows me to shave against the grain).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I squirt a bit of clubman on my electric razor head once in awhile to clean it off. The smell of my razor is really nice.</li>
    <li> Too sweet and flowery for me. No balls.</li>
    <li> Not my cup of tea and wife didn&#x27;t like it either. Was not able to return because it was flammable. Best to find a sample to sniff then consider buying the bottle. Going back to Nivea&#x27;s Aftershave balm.</li>
    <li> This is, without a doubt, the best after shave that I have ever used. Growing up, and getting my hair cut at the old local barber shop, I always loved the distinctive &amp;#34;old barber shop&amp;#34; smell. Years later, I discovered that the scent that triggered so many fond memories was this after shave. I had to order, Not a single regret either. Since I started using Clubman, I have received many compliments, especially from the ladies. Clubman after shave has a great scent that lasts, is not overpowering, and is timeless. If you want to smell classy, and like a true gentleman who&#x27;s got his act together, definitely pick up a bottle!</li>
    <li> Never buy a new fragrance for a guy.  Even if he&#x27;s a nephew.  He tried it.  Said it was ok, but I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;ll be using it.</li>
    <li> This is definitely an aftershave rather than an after lotion like it states on the bottle. It does have a very strong barber shop smell which I like but not everyday! It is an acquired taste to wear this everyday sadly I do not have that taste right now maybe in 20 years.</li>
    <li> So you&#x27;ve got your Merkur safety razor, Taylor of Old Bond Street Lavender shaving cream, &amp; Escali pure badger hair shaving brush. You&#x27;re almost there. With all the effort you&#x27;ve put in to giving yourself a proper shave, you need to finish it with the same panache: a splash of after shave. And it would be hard to top the clean scent &amp; refreshing feeling of Clubman Pinaud.</li>
    <li> This shave lotion takes me back to the barber shop when I was younger. The smell is great and the lotion is tingly.</li>
    <li> You really have to put it on and wait a minute or two for it to calm down before you judge the quality of this cologne because it&#x27;s overpowering at first. And what can I say about the price. It&#x27;s like finding a great tasting wine that you&#x27;d normally have to pay $25 for $5. It&#x27;s definitely a keeper.</li>
    <li> It has a nice scent, but it&#x27;s rather overpowering.  It will definitely wake you up in the morning!  I tried cutting it with some water, and that was a bit better.</li>
    <li> You see that pimping action figure on the bottle?  That&#x27;s how I feel and look like after putting this on.  Who wants to smell like they just strolled through a forest or went skinny dipping in the ocean?  Psh, I don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Product was as advertised and arrived in good time.</li>
    <li> Cant comment on how it works because i refused to put it on.  That may not be fair but it really does smell like a strong version of Brut cologne.  Some may like this smell, but I hate Brut cologne. I almost gagged when i put my nose to this bottle and immediately tossed it in the garbage. Everyone&#x27;s nose and likes are different. If you like Brut or dont know what Brut smells like, you might enjoy this product.  Like i said, i cant comment on how it performs as an aftershave, as i refused to try it. take that as you will.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure at first about this stuff.  I have been on the fence for a while about it.  The way the bottle is sealed you can&#x27;t test the scent at the drug store.  So when I needed to add something to my order for free shipping, I bit the bullet.&lt;br /&gt;At first, when you open the bottle and splash it on your hands the scent is  a little skunky.  BUT, once it settles out, it smells awesome.  There is a powdery scent that reminds you of the stuff the barber puts on your neck.  It lingers strong for only a little bit but comes back lightly throughout the day. Through the day it has a musky, powder smell that will make you think back to that barber shop I mentioned earlier.&lt;br /&gt;As for skin feel.  There&#x27;s that initial burn on splash and then it soaks in and feels amazing.  It tightens up and smooths out the skin and leaves you feeling like a million bucks.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s probably a reason this stuff has been around for a long time.</li>
    <li> This after shave has a clean, traditional smell that reminds me of the Saturday morning haircuts I had as a kid way back in the 1960s. It has a nice, bracing, mildly astringent feel when applied after a shave. The aroma is not overpowering and subtle, but lasts all day. Every great men&#x27;s barbershop I&#x27;ve ever been in uses Pinaud products, and after purchasing this I can see why.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this for over thirty years and as an everyday after shave it has a clean and fresh smell. Its an old timer product but will never get old for me.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It makes my skin feel great, smells good, and is cheap.  The smells reminds me of trips to the old-school barber shop with my grandpa when I was a little kid</li>
    <li> everyone smells great.</li>
    <li> Old time barbershop smell.  Immediately soothes and tightens razor irritated skin.</li>
    <li> This is that old-timey &amp;#34;burn your face and make you scream&amp;#34; aftershave. I love it though. It&#x27;s like wasabi - a moment of hell for an hour of pleasure. After the burn dies down your face feels smoother than a mo&#x27;fo. I follow it with an aftershave balm to make sure the alcohol doesn&#x27;t dehydrate my face. Smells good too...none of that flowery unisex stuff, this smells like a man.</li>
    <li> Smells like grandpa did while marching his way across Europe, defeating Hitler and restoring France&#x27;s greatness through copious deposits of DNA in the local repositories.  Works the charm as a bug repellant and lady attractant.  Most inexpensive fragrances depart as soon as they dry, but this one hangs in there from Pearl Harbor to V-E day and back again.</li>
    <li> Best After Shave Lotion.  Tried a few and very satisfied.</li>
    <li> These comments by Clubman users are hilarious.  They are all true though.  Clubman only sells testosterone in a bottle. They don&#x27;t sell anything else.  I swear that those metro types are afraid of me when they get a whiff of my Clubman musk.  Women seem to enjoy it as they are subconsciously attracted (due to evolutionary beginnings).</li>
    <li> Makes me feel I just left the barber shop. Great product.</li>
    <li> One of my new favorites!! I have been looking for different shaving lotions to give some kind of variety.  I have always used many of the drug store aftershaves because i shave every day and go through allot of it.  I still love my stetson, brut, skin bracer and aqua velva but wanted to try something new.  So after reading several reviews i picked a bottle of this up and man i love it.  Its cool and refreshing and no burn. After having it on a while it calms to a pretty subtle scent which i am enjoying.</li>
    <li> This is a good old school aftershave, reminds me of the barber shop for sure. It&#x27;s a clean, &amp;#34;just&amp;#34; groomed smell. I think it&#x27;s fantastic for the price. My wife even commented that it was pretty good. Worth a try for $6.</li>
    <li> Love the smell!! Not too overpowering. Will order some more when I run out.</li>
    <li> Great aftershave. A bit strong for those with sensitive skin. Definitely makes you smell like you just got a clean shave. My girlfriend doesn&#x27;t like the smell because it comes off too strong. but it does get the job done after a close shave.</li>
    <li> I think fragrance is a personal thing: you either like them or you dislike them, there isn&#x27;t a lot of middle ground. I personally love the classic Clubman fragrance. It reminds me of the barbershop my dad took me to when I was a kid. Reminds me of him, too. For the price, you can afford to give this a try sometime. Even if you dislike it, it&#x27;s not like tossing it out would cost you a ton of money. But if you&#x27;ve ever had a haircut in a real barbershop, chance are you are already familiar with Clubman.</li>
    <li> Not only is this the BEST after shave lotion I&#x27;ve ever used but it also has this crisp manly scent to it. This product leaves your face feeling clean and refreshed after a shave and is especially good at preventing irritation / redness and does a decent job at coagulating the blood of any nicks you may have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t ever use another shave lotion ever again, I&#x27;m a Clubman Pinaud convert.</li>
    <li> For that price is not bad at all .Is smell nice .Is on my list .I haven&#x27;t trying .but i would think it&#x27;s a classic one for after shaving</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, excellent product</li>
    <li> works great - feels great..&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend better than perfume coz of acne..&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not too strong</li>
    <li> i was shocked how fast it arrived and that i was still able to buy it on amazon its is very hard product to find and its old school barber shop smell i remember as a child getting applied bye the old fashion barber in my town i  grew up in reminds me of my youth i have many more expensive after shaves but clubman is old world charm of things gone bye when a trip to barber shop for a shave n hair cut was a place to chit chat and hear gossip and leave with a sense of close town home feelings of home &amp; hearth and clubman to me brings me back to this when i put it on makes me walk with a spring in my step all day don&#x27;t judge a book bye its cover its not expensive but  many things in life that are oh so very good &amp;dont have to cost you a arm &amp; a  leg i higly recomend the product you will feel young again and renewed i know i do when i wear it  i smell sucess T :)</li>
    <li> An inexpensive everyday after shave. Not for date night but very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Stuff smells great and feels great! Manly shaving smell, smooth and soothing. Has a tiny bit of a burn, but for me it&#x27;s barely there. Heard that it burns a lot for other people though. But I like it a lot, sort of drys my face so I put a dab of lotion on after. I recomend it!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak for how a woman likes this aftershave.  I have yet to ask my girlfriend. Because it really doesn&#x27;t matter.  This is now a ritual to shave my bald head and apply Clubman Pinaud to my scalp, put on my man-robe, play playstation and drink whisky.  I can feel my manhood expand by 20 percent and thank me for being an awesome man.  I think my girlfriend suspects an affair, but it is just clubman.  I will update my review after combining clubman and three wolf moon shirt.</li>
    <li> I and a lot of college kids discovered Clubman aftershave in the 60s as an economical alternative to Canoe. I have continued to use it although it can be hard to find. Clubman has a nice mild scent-like Canoe, and my daughters frequently mention that they like the fragrance when I give them a hug.  It&#x27;s good to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> It does not smell fresh at all. Old, musty and sweetish. Would much rather go for the regular old spice after shave smell over this.</li>
    <li> great aftershave at a ridiculously low price</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cool n smells good. overall worth trying</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s #1 complain on this after shave lotion is the smell of \\&quot;old man\\&quot;.  It definitely feels good after every shave, but the smell is bad enough to warrant a 1 less star.  I probably won&#x27;t get it again.</li>
