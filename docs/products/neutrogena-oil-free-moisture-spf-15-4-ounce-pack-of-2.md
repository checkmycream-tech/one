      <li>Works good, though.  </li>
      <li>It was light, non-greasy, and best of all: it didn&#x27;t contain avobenzone.</li>
      <li>Finding a good sunscreen that does not contain avobenzone is a challenge, and this was a good one.</li>
      <li>This product is good.</li>
      <li>Maybe this will be good for hand lotion, at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>, is non-comedogenic, is not fragrant, feels good on my skin and doesn&#x27;t need to be replaced too often.</li>
      <li>I find it most excellent for daytime use and it even provides a nice healthy glow.</li>
      <li>I use most Neutrogena products, they are very effective and does not irritate my skin.  </li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>This item is exactly as described and it came at an excellent price and shipped ultra-fast via PRIME...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years now and love it!  </li>
      <li>Its also nice to use under makeup helps it go on smoother for a better look as well!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ordering more of this product because it&#x27;s really good.</li>
      <li>, it keeps my skin nice moisturized.</li>
      <li>After 10 years of loving Neutrogena oil-free moisture, I guess I will have to find something else.</li>
      <li>nice lotion, recommended by our dermatologist</li>
      <li>Used and loved the original product for 40 years!  </li>
      <li>however, that product doesn&#x27;t have SPF, so i went with the Neutrogena, which does the job fine and is a good price.  </li>
      <li>When I was frequently complimented on my skin, I would recommend this moisturizer, which was absolutely perfect in every way.  </li>
      <li>Nice face skin :)</li>
      <li>Ive tried many lotions, some were too oily, some didn&#x27;t moisturize.</li>
      <li>Never found anything better.</li>
      <li>another discntinued item from amazon, i love this moisterizer, need it to return</li>
      <li>recently a more olive-skinned friend and</li>
      <li>I love this product it keeps my face moisturized throught out the day and also protects it from getting sunburnt.</li>
      <li>and I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>I used this product for years before switching to the Neutrogena Healthy Skin formulation, which contains glycolic acid.</li>
      <li>brand that I&#x27;ve tried, and most &amp;#34;department store&amp;#34; brands that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t let the plaqin packaging and low price fool you - this stuff works great!</li>
      <li>I am heartbroken that one of my all-time favorite products has disappeared.  </li>
      <li>So on top of it messing up my face, it doesn&#x27;t even do what it claims to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>guess I should have done more research before making purchases on things that go on my face.  </li>
      <li>It is more like a lotion than a cream.</li>
      <li>And I never found anything else that was better, so</li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t have to wash my face with anything more than a damp wash cloth.</li>
      <li>What more can you ask?</li>
      <li>and i love neutrogena products.</li>
      <li>hope this helped :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisturizer for many years.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>This is an ok moisturizing lotion, but Neutrogena has others, that are even better.</li>
      <li>And it is more of a matte finish, without the oil or shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So you have to use alot more to feel like it&#x27;s there.</li>
      <li>Before the change, it was the perfect facial moisturizer for my acne prone face.</li>
      <li>well I cant find a better product for my face that is so well priced</li>
      <li>and it almost makes your scare stand out 10x more than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic moisturizer!  </li>
      <li>This used to be my favorite face moisturizing lotion.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s oil free, without any significant scent, and is effective as a moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Their customer service was very helpful and pleasant and was very quick about sending me a refund.  </li>
      <li>I am all for having sunblock in my moisturizer, but this one feels and smells a lot more like sunblock than as an oil free moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>My favorite moisturizer... very good fro dry skin.</li>
      <li>It is really my favorite lotion with spf, light easy to use, does not clog your pores.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other moisturizers but consider this one to be the best.  </li>
      <li>I burn easily and it works.  </li>
      <li>i strongly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Price is very reasonable, I love the products, I always make sure I do not run out.</li>
      <li>I kept using it and it has been fine.</li>
      <li>It is not bad, but I think that there are better oil free moisturizers out there.</li>
      <li>It feels light and refreshing with no unpleasant ordor.  </li>
      <li>Very good, all that could be expected</li>
      <li>No oily residue, goes on smoothly and provides SPF.  </li>
      <li>Even though it is supposed to be oil free</li>
      <li>Neut Oil Free with SPF.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and does not feel oily or sticky.  </li>
      <li>I needed an oil free sunscreen for my face that would not cause breakouts and I cant stand the smell of sunscreen</li>
      <li>It was great, but Neutrogena changed the formula sometime back in 2013.</li>
      <li>product should be recalled, I guess its off to wholefoods or trader joes for some organic oil free moisturizer</li>
      <li>Skin feels smooth and it leaves your face not feeling slippery.  </li>
      <li>My skin is prone to breaking out when I use moisturizers, even those that are oil free, but this one doesn&#x27;t do that to me.  </li>
      <li>it definitely is light</li>
      <li>but strangers keep commenting on the fact that I my still is smooth.</li>
      <li>Good for my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s clean, non-greasy, doesn&#x27;t give me acne.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really light and easily absorbed so you won&#x27;t get that greasy feeling on your face</li>
      <li>(I would need a more intense moisturizing product during those times).</li>
      <li>Will be seeking a different brand unless Neutrogena brings back the original formula of this formerly perfect product.</li>
      <li>Light, fragrance-free, ideal for delicate, fussy skin like mine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d tried Purpose, which is an excellent brand, but more expensive.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been a loyal Neutrogena user for over 10 years --</li>
      <li>/&gt;Really, Neurtogena, I expected effective, affordable and SAFE products from you.</li>
      <li>and it absorbs quickly into skin.</li>
      <li>This used to be my favorite SPF face lotion for winter when I don&#x27;t need so high SPF</li>
      <li>Small amounts needed at a time, great size for travel and also easy on the wallet.</li>
      <li>If you dampen your face first, then apply lightly, it won&#x27;t feel greasy at all.</li>
      <li>It gets absorbed quickly and is truly non-greasy.</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happily satisfied!</li>
      <li>favorite is the \\&quot;Neutrogena Visibly Even moisturizer\\&quot; which I am able to apply both day and night, as it goes on very smooth, thin, and light.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and love this product.</li>
      <li>I, and many others, am sensitive to avobenzone.</li>
      <li>My determatologist always told me always to use this brand because its great for sensitive skin like I have and moisturizer always keeps your skin moist and younger.</li>
      <li>This Neutrogena feels really good on my skin, goes on smoothly, and seems to keep my skin feeling soft for a long time.  </li>
      <li>I have very fair, delicate, even wussy-like skin ;), and</li>
      <li>The SPF is just right for my skin.  </li>
      <li>it turns my skin into a greaseball right after I apply it.</li>
      <li>And the price was right on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Do some comparasing and get the product that is right for you.</li>
      <li>They are good, but not worth me paying triple the price.</li>
      <li>Amazon has not updated the product photos to accurately reflect the new ingredients.  </li>
      <li>It will make your old scare turn bright red</li>
      <li>and then my face became greasy very fast...</li>
      <li>the price is also very reasonable.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried higher end moisturizers.</li>
      <li>Higher SPF reacts adversely w/ my chemistry.</li>
      <li>When I sweat and it mixes w/ a higher SPF product I develop skin poisoning if I&#x27;m out in the sun.</li>
      <li>This used to be one of my favorite facial sunscreens.</li>
      <li>Simply put, my favorite face lotion.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and this stuff is fantastic.</li>
      <li>Use it daily and have not gotten sunburned. :)</li>
      <li>maybe it&#x27;s just when you first start using it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel soft and comfortable and has never given me breakouts.  </li>
      <li>I also use their \\&quot;Healthy Defense daily moisturizer\\&quot; with tint, to use underneath makeup and add a touch of color to the face.</li>
      <li>This model is just their most basic one.</li>
      <li>At first I was hesitant, I was thinking should I get this one or should I get the men one.</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t leave the face as nice feeling as the more expensive Menscience Advanced Face Lotion.  </li>
      <li>but i noticed it made my skin super soft!!</li>
      <li>I could even use this product during the summer, when it is very hot and humid where I live.</li>
      <li>Time to move onto another brand that offers more, not less.</li>
      <li>I have used this moisturizer for a long time and I love it.</li>
      <li>so you can know which reviews are relevant to your purchase (aka, if you must disregard the old reviews that were written for an older version of the product).</li>
      <li>But most other moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried make my face shine right away.</li>
      <li>It smells extremely strongly of sunblock and has the same consistency.</li>
      <li>I do use the non-SPF version at night just because my husband doesn&#x27;t really like the smell of sunscreen, and it works just as well.  </li>
      <li>Finding one that does not give me zits or a whole in my wallet was driving me nuts.</li>
      <li>my whole face was practically swollen.</li>
      <li>Works really well for my oily skin.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin very shiny.</li>
      <li>Feels like it sits on my skin vs. absorbing it.</li>
      <li>It is fragrance-free and gentle on my skin.  </li>
      <li>my face is quite red allot of the time.&lt;br /&gt;Update: Makes my face feel good and soft take care of the red.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The new formula also causes burning the first couple of times I used it.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a oily residue and keeps my face from becoming dry.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any more clogging than with other products.</li>
      <li>This face lotion works just as well or better than any other &amp;#34;drug-store&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I would have to keep re-applying and re-applying on my especially dry skin, sometimes many times throughout the day.</li>
      <li>My skin is really sensitive and oil and this one works really well!</li>
      <li>People always compliment me on my skin, and I used to wonder if my skin truly is protected with such a low SPF rating, but this did a lot towards convincing me.  </li>
      <li>a somewhat decent brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>There are so many out there to choose from, and Neutrogena, in particular, offers a wide array of skin products, for practically any skin type.</li>
      <li>It contains just the right amount of moisturizers to help my skin on the most driest of days, without being too thick and creamy, or greasy.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>: it&#x27;s effective on skin constantly made dry and sensitive by Benzoyl peroxide and Retin A products.</li>
      <li>but I know the spf is probably just making it a little more oily than I was used to.</li>
      <li>got a major rash from putting it on the first time and I didn&#x27;t use anything else.  </li>
      <li>To top it off it offered a little sun protection.</li>
      <li>My skin type: I have sensitive combination skin, which easily gets irritated and can break out after a single face scratch.   </li>
      <li>So I washed my face with raw, liquid black soap and applied this at night and woke up the next morning with nearly flawless skin.</li>
      <li>She said she loves this and hasnt had any stinging or uncomfortable feeling leaving her skin feeling great.  </li>
      <li>No matter what I use to clean my face, I still need moisturizer or it feels dry.</li>
      <li>I have normal skin.</li>
      <li>and I love how moisturizing it is without feeling heavy.</li>
      <li>It sometimes still feels/looks a little greasy, but better than the other oil free moisturizers that I had been using.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Olay with SPF for years, and decided I&#x27;d like to try something new.  </li>
      <li>The new product also makes my eyes and lips sting, and my face does not feel moisturized.   </li>
      <li>The new version being sold by amazon has a cucumber-like smell to it.</li>
      <li>The new version has 4 sunscreen ingredients: Avobenzone, Octisalate, Octocrylene, and Oxybenzone.  </li>
      <li>I bought this for my wife who has very sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>It took me several days to realize what was going on, but the pain stopped when I stopped using this product, so it was a pretty clear-cut connection.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Before purchasing this facial moisturizer for the first time, I would take a look at some others that are out there.</li>
      <li>Been using this for many years, mainly because in my area it&#x27;s suprisingly hard to find a moisturizer with an SPF15 content.</li>
      <li>I had pink blotches all over and have been super itchy.  </li>
      <li>I gave it two stars because it is a name brand product and, in all fairness, my eyes could be particularly sensitive and my response is not necessarily a universal one, but it was pretty severe.  </li>
      <li>It smelled a little like sunblock, which didn&#x27;t bother me, but when I awoke the following morning after applying, my jawline, cheeks, and neck were red, bumpy, and super super itchy!</li>
      <li>However, the new version apparently has a new formulation with &amp;#34;broad spectrum SPF 15&amp;#34; rather than &amp;#34;SPF 15&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>I was a loyal Neutrogena product user for years, but now that I see their ingredients include Oxybenzone (3% in this product) -which can disrupt the hormone system among other side effects.</li>
      <li>so I spent the extra money to get this Neutrogena Oil free moisture with sunscreen.</li>
      <li>About an hour later, my whole body was the colour of a lobster...</li>
      <li>However, my face is also (oddly enough) very prone to breaking out.  </li>
      <li>I found it to be much lighter than the Clinique Daily Moisturizing Lotion that I had been using.</li>
      <li>My face feels soft and hydrated without the stickiness.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin that is also break-out prone</li>
      <li>I never got sunburned with the old formula, so</li>
      <li>(Neutrogena Oil-Free Sensitive Skin) at night.  </li>
      <li>For years now this has been my go to daily moisturizer and it has worked very well</li>
      <li>On the reverse, it clearly states that it will &amp;#34;not prevent skin cancer or early skin aging.&amp;#34; Conclusion:</li>
      <li>So I really don&#x27;t know now which brand to trust whenever they claim such things on their products</li>
      <li>I naturally have oily skin, so every now</li>
      <li>I bought it so that I can use it for winter and so far it&#x27;s working out</li>
      <li>The old version had three sunscreen ingredients: Octinoxate, Octisalate, and Oxybenzone.  </li>
      <li>Beware, if you are at all sensitive to scents, you may find this product repulsive.  </li>
      <li>but when I moved from the cool east coast to dry, sunny southern California, I decided to upgrade from Neutrogena Combination Skin Moisturizer to this product.</li>
      <li>The original moisturizer had little to no scent at all.</li>
      <li>and my skin is normally pretty dry.  </li>
      <li>It took a couple of days for my face to get back to normal.</li>
      <li>I first used it as a sample product and will now be a lifelong customer.</li>
      <li>BUT I recently discovered that the new bottle I bought has no UVA/UVB Broad Spectrum protection!</li>
      <li>I know it was the moisturizer because it was the only new product that I had used that week.  </li>
      <li>For several weeks I tried to figure out what was causing this unusual texture in the mouth, under and above my lips.  </li>
      <li>It DOES fade within a few minutes, but it&#x27;s definitely a change from the original stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>For new buyers, just know that everyone&#x27;s skin is different, and maybe this new formula may work for you, but just don&#x27;t read reviews written before 2014 FOR THE SPF 15 because that is for a different product than the current version Neutrogena is selling.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it for the neck, where it&#x27;s quite safe, but am skeptical about the face.</li>
      <li>The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me (it barely smells).  </li>
      <li>I was afraid that the good price could not ensure the quality</li>
      <li>The difference between the texture of my face after applying the product (rough, itchy, bumpy) to what it was before (normal) is staggering!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really helped to keep my face from getting too dark.</li>
      <li>I use it year round, and am an avid outdoorsy type.</li>
      <li>I saw that this was selling for less than $10 (should have been my first red flag) and, while I never personally used Neutrogena brands, I always thought it was</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cancelled my subscription to this product after I discovered the new smell, but after using the new stuff for a few months, with the exception of the smell, it seems to produce the same results.</li>
      <li>I opted to go for the less intense salon at 10 minutes.  </li>
      <li>- the Olay was a squeeze and pour, and I was always getting too much or too little.  </li>
      <li>This product feels lighter, less oily, and less shiny than the following 3 brands:   - Cetaphil Fragrance Free Daily Facial Moisturizer, SPF 15   - Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream for Dry, Sensitve Skin   -</li>
</ol>

<li> Finding a good sunscreen that does not contain avobenzone is a challenge, and this was a good one.</li>
<li> This product is good.</li>
<li> Maybe this will be good for hand lotion, at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> nice lotion, recommended by our dermatologist</li>
<li> Used and loved the original product for 40 years!  </li>
<li> however, that product doesn&#x27;t have SPF, so i went with the Neutrogena, which does the job fine and is a good price.  </li>
<li> When I was frequently complimented on my skin, I would recommend this moisturizer, which was absolutely perfect in every way.  </li>
<li> Nice face skin :)</li>
<li> Ive tried many lotions, some were too oily, some didn&#x27;t moisturize.</li>
<li> Never found anything better.</li>
<li> another discntinued item from amazon, i love this moisterizer, need it to return</li>
<li> recently a more olive-skinned friend and</li>
<li> I love this product it keeps my face moisturized throught out the day and also protects it from getting sunburnt.</li>
<li> and I love this stuff.  </li>
<li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
<li> I used this product for years before switching to the Neutrogena Healthy Skin formulation, which contains glycolic acid.</li>
<li> brand that I&#x27;ve tried, and most &amp;#34;department store&amp;#34; brands that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t let the plaqin packaging and low price fool you - this stuff works great!</li>
<li> I am heartbroken that one of my all-time favorite products has disappeared.  </li>
<li> So on top of it messing up my face, it doesn&#x27;t even do what it claims to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> guess I should have done more research before making purchases on things that go on my face.  </li>
<li> It is more like a lotion than a cream.</li>
<li> And I never found anything else that was better, so</li>
<li> so I didn&#x27;t have to wash my face with anything more than a damp wash cloth.</li>
<li> What more can you ask?</li>
<li> and i love neutrogena products.</li>
<li> hope this helped :)</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisturizer for many years.  </li>
<li> Love it.</li>
<li> This is an ok moisturizing lotion, but Neutrogena has others, that are even better.</li>
<li> And it is more of a matte finish, without the oil or shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> So you have to use alot more to feel like it&#x27;s there.</li>
<li> Before the change, it was the perfect facial moisturizer for my acne prone face.</li>
<li> well I cant find a better product for my face that is so well priced</li>
<li> and it almost makes your scare stand out 10x more than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> This is a fantastic moisturizer!  </li>
<li> This used to be my favorite face moisturizing lotion.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s oil free, without any significant scent, and is effective as a moisturizer.</li>
<li> Their customer service was very helpful and pleasant and was very quick about sending me a refund.  </li>
<li> I am all for having sunblock in my moisturizer, but this one feels and smells a lot more like sunblock than as an oil free moisturizer.  </li>
<li> My favorite moisturizer... very good fro dry skin.</li>
<li> It is really my favorite lotion with spf, light easy to use, does not clog your pores.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried other moisturizers but consider this one to be the best.  </li>
<li> I burn easily and it works.  </li>
<li> i strongly recommend it.</li>
<li> Price is very reasonable, I love the products, I always make sure I do not run out.</li>
<li> I kept using it and it has been fine.</li>
<li> It is not bad, but I think that there are better oil free moisturizers out there.</li>
<li> It feels light and refreshing with no unpleasant ordor.  </li>
<li> Very good, all that could be expected</li>
<li> No oily residue, goes on smoothly and provides SPF.  </li>
<li> Even though it is supposed to be oil free</li>
<li> Neut Oil Free with SPF.</li>
<li> It goes on smooth and does not feel oily or sticky.  </li>
<li> I needed an oil free sunscreen for my face that would not cause breakouts and I cant stand the smell of sunscreen</li>
<li> It was great, but Neutrogena changed the formula sometime back in 2013.</li>
<li> product should be recalled, I guess its off to wholefoods or trader joes for some organic oil free moisturizer</li>
<li> Skin feels smooth and it leaves your face not feeling slippery.  </li>
<li> My skin is prone to breaking out when I use moisturizers, even those that are oil free, but this one doesn&#x27;t do that to me.  </li>
<li> it definitely is light</li>
<li> but strangers keep commenting on the fact that I my still is smooth.</li>
<li> Good for my sensitive skin.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s clean, non-greasy, doesn&#x27;t give me acne.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s really light and easily absorbed so you won&#x27;t get that greasy feeling on your face</li>
<li> (I would need a more intense moisturizing product during those times).</li>
<li> Will be seeking a different brand unless Neutrogena brings back the original formula of this formerly perfect product.</li>
<li> Light, fragrance-free, ideal for delicate, fussy skin like mine.</li>
<li> I&#x27;d tried Purpose, which is an excellent brand, but more expensive.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal Neutrogena user for over 10 years --</li>
<li> /&gt;Really, Neurtogena, I expected effective, affordable and SAFE products from you.</li>
<li> and it absorbs quickly into skin.</li>
<li> This used to be my favorite SPF face lotion for winter when I don&#x27;t need so high SPF</li>
<li> Small amounts needed at a time, great size for travel and also easy on the wallet.</li>
<li> If you dampen your face first, then apply lightly, it won&#x27;t feel greasy at all.</li>
<li> It gets absorbed quickly and is truly non-greasy.</li>
<li> Overall, I&#x27;m happily satisfied!</li>
<li> favorite is the \\&quot;Neutrogena Visibly Even moisturizer\\&quot; which I am able to apply both day and night, as it goes on very smooth, thin, and light.</li>
<li> I have sensitive skin and love this product.</li>
<li> I, and many others, am sensitive to avobenzone.</li>
<li> My determatologist always told me always to use this brand because its great for sensitive skin like I have and moisturizer always keeps your skin moist and younger.</li>
<li> This Neutrogena feels really good on my skin, goes on smoothly, and seems to keep my skin feeling soft for a long time.  </li>
<li> I have very fair, delicate, even wussy-like skin ;), and</li>
<li> The SPF is just right for my skin.  </li>
<li> it turns my skin into a greaseball right after I apply it.</li>
<li> And the price was right on Amazon.</li>
<li> Do some comparasing and get the product that is right for you.</li>
<li> They are good, but not worth me paying triple the price.</li>
<li> Amazon has not updated the product photos to accurately reflect the new ingredients.  </li>
<li> It will make your old scare turn bright red</li>
<li> and then my face became greasy very fast...</li>
<li> the price is also very reasonable.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried higher end moisturizers.</li>
<li> Higher SPF reacts adversely w/ my chemistry.</li>
<li> When I sweat and it mixes w/ a higher SPF product I develop skin poisoning if I&#x27;m out in the sun.</li>
<li> This used to be one of my favorite facial sunscreens.</li>
<li> Simply put, my favorite face lotion.  </li>
<li> I have sensitive skin and this stuff is fantastic.</li>
<li> Use it daily and have not gotten sunburned. :)</li>
<li> maybe it&#x27;s just when you first start using it.&lt;br</li>
<li> It makes my skin feel soft and comfortable and has never given me breakouts.  </li>
<li> I also use their \\&quot;Healthy Defense daily moisturizer\\&quot; with tint, to use underneath makeup and add a touch of color to the face.</li>
<li> This model is just their most basic one.</li>
<li> At first I was hesitant, I was thinking should I get this one or should I get the men one.</li>
<li> but it doesn&#x27;t leave the face as nice feeling as the more expensive Menscience Advanced Face Lotion.  </li>
<li> but i noticed it made my skin super soft!!</li>
<li> I could even use this product during the summer, when it is very hot and humid where I live.</li>
<li> Time to move onto another brand that offers more, not less.</li>
<li> I have used this moisturizer for a long time and I love it.</li>
<li> so you can know which reviews are relevant to your purchase (aka, if you must disregard the old reviews that were written for an older version of the product).</li>
<li> But most other moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried make my face shine right away.</li>
<li> It smells extremely strongly of sunblock and has the same consistency.</li>
<li> I do use the non-SPF version at night just because my husband doesn&#x27;t really like the smell of sunscreen, and it works just as well.  </li>
<li> Finding one that does not give me zits or a whole in my wallet was driving me nuts.</li>
<li> my whole face was practically swollen.</li>
<li> Works really well for my oily skin.</li>
<li> It makes my skin very shiny.</li>
<li> Feels like it sits on my skin vs. absorbing it.</li>
<li> It is fragrance-free and gentle on my skin.  </li>
<li> my face is quite red allot of the time.&lt;br /&gt;Update: Makes my face feel good and soft take care of the red.</li>
<li> /&gt;The new formula also causes burning the first couple of times I used it.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a oily residue and keeps my face from becoming dry.  </li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any more clogging than with other products.</li>
<li> This face lotion works just as well or better than any other &amp;#34;drug-store&amp;#34;</li>
<li> I would have to keep re-applying and re-applying on my especially dry skin, sometimes many times throughout the day.</li>
<li> My skin is really sensitive and oil and this one works really well!</li>
<li> People always compliment me on my skin, and I used to wonder if my skin truly is protected with such a low SPF rating, but this did a lot towards convincing me.  </li>
<li> a somewhat decent brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
<li> There are so many out there to choose from, and Neutrogena, in particular, offers a wide array of skin products, for practically any skin type.</li>
<li> It contains just the right amount of moisturizers to help my skin on the most driest of days, without being too thick and creamy, or greasy.</li>
<li> Highly recommended.</li>
<li> Highly recommend.</li>
<li> : it&#x27;s effective on skin constantly made dry and sensitive by Benzoyl peroxide and Retin A products.</li>
<li> but I know the spf is probably just making it a little more oily than I was used to.</li>
<li> got a major rash from putting it on the first time and I didn&#x27;t use anything else.  </li>
<li> To top it off it offered a little sun protection.</li>
<li> My skin type: I have sensitive combination skin, which easily gets irritated and can break out after a single face scratch.   </li>
<li> So I washed my face with raw, liquid black soap and applied this at night and woke up the next morning with nearly flawless skin.</li>
<li> She said she loves this and hasnt had any stinging or uncomfortable feeling leaving her skin feeling great.  </li>
<li> No matter what I use to clean my face, I still need moisturizer or it feels dry.</li>
<li> I have normal skin.</li>
<li> and I love how moisturizing it is without feeling heavy.</li>
<li> It sometimes still feels/looks a little greasy, but better than the other oil free moisturizers that I had been using.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay with SPF for years, and decided I&#x27;d like to try something new.  </li>
<li> The new product also makes my eyes and lips sting, and my face does not feel moisturized.   </li>
<li> The new version being sold by amazon has a cucumber-like smell to it.</li>
<li> The new version has 4 sunscreen ingredients: Avobenzone, Octisalate, Octocrylene, and Oxybenzone.  </li>
<li> I bought this for my wife who has very sensitive skin.  </li>
<li> It took me several days to realize what was going on, but the pain stopped when I stopped using this product, so it was a pretty clear-cut connection.</li>
<li> /&gt;Before purchasing this facial moisturizer for the first time, I would take a look at some others that are out there.</li>
<li> Been using this for many years, mainly because in my area it&#x27;s suprisingly hard to find a moisturizer with an SPF15 content.</li>
<li> I had pink blotches all over and have been super itchy.  </li>
<li> I gave it two stars because it is a name brand product and, in all fairness, my eyes could be particularly sensitive and my response is not necessarily a universal one, but it was pretty severe.  </li>
<li> It smelled a little like sunblock, which didn&#x27;t bother me, but when I awoke the following morning after applying, my jawline, cheeks, and neck were red, bumpy, and super super itchy!</li>
<li> However, the new version apparently has a new formulation with &amp;#34;broad spectrum SPF 15&amp;#34; rather than &amp;#34;SPF 15&amp;#34;.  </li>
<li> I was a loyal Neutrogena product user for years, but now that I see their ingredients include Oxybenzone (3% in this product) -which can disrupt the hormone system among other side effects.</li>
<li> so I spent the extra money to get this Neutrogena Oil free moisture with sunscreen.</li>
<li> About an hour later, my whole body was the colour of a lobster...</li>
<li> However, my face is also (oddly enough) very prone to breaking out.  </li>
<li> I found it to be much lighter than the Clinique Daily Moisturizing Lotion that I had been using.</li>
<li> My face feels soft and hydrated without the stickiness.</li>
<li> I have sensitive skin that is also break-out prone</li>
<li> I never got sunburned with the old formula, so</li>
<li> (Neutrogena Oil-Free Sensitive Skin) at night.  </li>
<li> For years now this has been my go to daily moisturizer and it has worked very well</li>
<li> On the reverse, it clearly states that it will &amp;#34;not prevent skin cancer or early skin aging.&amp;#34; Conclusion:</li>
<li> So I really don&#x27;t know now which brand to trust whenever they claim such things on their products</li>
<li> I naturally have oily skin, so every now</li>
<li> I bought it so that I can use it for winter and so far it&#x27;s working out</li>
<li> The old version had three sunscreen ingredients: Octinoxate, Octisalate, and Oxybenzone.  </li>
<li> Beware, if you are at all sensitive to scents, you may find this product repulsive.  </li>
<li> but when I moved from the cool east coast to dry, sunny southern California, I decided to upgrade from Neutrogena Combination Skin Moisturizer to this product.</li>
<li> The original moisturizer had little to no scent at all.</li>
<li> and my skin is normally pretty dry.  </li>
<li> It took a couple of days for my face to get back to normal.</li>
<li> I first used it as a sample product and will now be a lifelong customer.</li>
<li> BUT I recently discovered that the new bottle I bought has no UVA/UVB Broad Spectrum protection!</li>
<li> I know it was the moisturizer because it was the only new product that I had used that week.  </li>
<li> For several weeks I tried to figure out what was causing this unusual texture in the mouth, under and above my lips.  </li>
<li> It DOES fade within a few minutes, but it&#x27;s definitely a change from the original stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> For new buyers, just know that everyone&#x27;s skin is different, and maybe this new formula may work for you, but just don&#x27;t read reviews written before 2014 FOR THE SPF 15 because that is for a different product than the current version Neutrogena is selling.</li>
<li> I highly recommend it for the neck, where it&#x27;s quite safe, but am skeptical about the face.</li>
<li> The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me (it barely smells).  </li>
<li> I was afraid that the good price could not ensure the quality</li>
<li> The difference between the texture of my face after applying the product (rough, itchy, bumpy) to what it was before (normal) is staggering!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s really helped to keep my face from getting too dark.</li>
<li> I use it year round, and am an avid outdoorsy type.</li>
<li> I saw that this was selling for less than $10 (should have been my first red flag) and, while I never personally used Neutrogena brands, I always thought it was</li>
<li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cancelled my subscription to this product after I discovered the new smell, but after using the new stuff for a few months, with the exception of the smell, it seems to produce the same results.</li>
<li> I opted to go for the less intense salon at 10 minutes.  </li>
<li> - the Olay was a squeeze and pour, and I was always getting too much or too little.  </li>
<li> This product feels lighter, less oily, and less shiny than the following 3 brands:   - Cetaphil Fragrance Free Daily Facial Moisturizer, SPF 15   - Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream for Dry, Sensitve Skin   -</li>
<li> I usually like Neutrogena and am loyal to their other facial products.</li>
<li> That night and into the morning of next day, that area of my face was red and swollen and there were little bumps that were weeping clear fluid (yuck!).  </li>
<li> That one goes on a little thick too, but it&#x27;s worth it to have a natural glow.</li>
<li> Higher than that, and it&#x27;s marketed as sunscreen, and even I&#x27;m not that fanatic about protecting my skin.  </li>
<li> I usually don&#x27;t have TOO much of a problem with breakouts (unless my aunt Flo is in town)</li>
<li> I use it here in Arizona before my lap swims and after a summer of 4-5 sessions a week, plus other outdoor activity, my skin feels soft and not at all dry or sun damaged.</li>
<li> Both come in the pump bottles so it is easy to pick the wrong one.  </li>
<li> If I overdo it, dry itchy skin usually gets back to normal after one application, and redness disappears after one-two hours.</li>
<li> and he didn&#x27;t know what it was either, except that it was likely due to a recent change in something I was consuming.  </li>
<li> I have combination skin and have struggled with moisturizers for a long time.</li>
<li> but I use this product a few times a day (especially after showering and shaving) and now - no dry skin at all.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried other types of oil-free face moisturizers, but this is the only one that does not cause acne.</li>
<li> I wake up with dry skin around my mouth each morning.</li>
<li> I had dry skin on my face</li>
<li> It kept my skin from getting too dry over the winter, and keeps it from being too oily in the summer.</li>
<li> /&gt;There are times when my skin gets especially dry and the moisture provided here, would not be enough.</li>
<li> I tried eliminating several things, but finally I wondered if this lotion was causing the breakout and within a few days of stopping use of this product the bumps have disappeared and</li>
<li> There are still patches of dry, rough skin left here and there, and I suspect they will be gone altogether in the next few days.</li>
<li> I am a guy, not high maintenance.</li>
<li> Compared to the previous review, this moisturizer has  no necessary oil  in it, making it feel like it&#x27;s not there, after you&#x27;ve applied it.  </li>
<li> I was very eager to buy this face moisturizer when I saw that it&#x27;s oil free but got disappointed because it still brings oil to my face in less than an hour after applying it!</li>
<li> i have been using it only for a little while</li>
<li> It sinks into my skin ,and doesn&#x27;t make my face look greasy.</li>
<li> I have very dry skin, but it is also acne prone due to its sensitivity to chemicals.</li>
<li> I only need one small squeeze each morning.</li>
<li> I cannot comment on other uses.</li>
<li> I&#x27;v also tried Aveeno, L&#x27;Oreal, and other well-known brands.</li>
<li> I applied this only on my face and neck, as per usual, about 20 minutes before going in.</li>
<li> Not sure how oil-free this product actually is.  </li>
<li> Check out the EWG guide to sunscreens and other products on the hall of shame and see what products they recommend here:  </li>
<li> At least four other Amazon customers had the same rash/allergy from using this product.  </li>
<li> It feels less oily than other products i have tried.</li>
<li> Less greasy than other oil-free products, and I haven&#x27;t gotten any breakouts.</li>
<li> It also covers skin blotches and dark spots as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I had to put alot of steroid cream for the swelling to go down.  </li>
<li> that&#x27;s typical from some moisturizers.</li>
<li> I have rosacea, and apparently, this is irritating my skin.</li>
<li> but I haven&#x27;t bought anything other than this for the past 10 years.</li>
<li> I wanted a moisturizer that contained SPF since I was otherwise using Shiseido Sun Protection Cream, which I thought was a little too thick (and pretty expensive) for everyday wear.  </li>
<li> Several weeks ago I opened a new bottle and was shocked to discover a peculiar scent, and a change in consistency.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer  for a few years.</li>
<li> ... and have to wear moisturizer and sunscreen everyday.  </li>
<li> I use it everyday.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years, and now keep it on subscribe and save every 3 months.</li>
<li> I use this product everyday.  </li>
<li> I have had almost NO allergies to food or products in the past, but this lotion seemed to cause a strange breakout of small bumps on the INSIDE of my mouth!  </li>
<li> As a male, I prefer it over all the other, even expensive, &amp;#34;for men&amp;#34; face lotions.</li>
<li> Their oil-free moisture lotion seems to go on too thick (compared to other products) and gives my skin a greasy, shiny, look when worn under makeup.</li>
<li> I tried this product because it was less expensive than Aveeno&#x27;s moisturizer with the same SPF.  </li>
<li> I have not put anything on my face the past two days</li>
<li> Not no more.</li>
<li> I was pretty disappointed in this product.  </li>
<li> What a waste of money!</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
<li> (I usually have that problem).</li>
<li> Her pimples have gotten a little worse since she&#x27;s been using this product.</li>
<li> Also, it has a heavy sunscreen smell that lasts all day, and it is very thick and greasy.  </li>
<li> This is a horrible product from neutrogena, I bought it because it was oil free and</li>
<li> nevertheless I&#x27;m still using it since I  found a way to at least diminish the oiliness on my face after applying it.</li>
<li> I use it instead as a nighttime moisturizing cr&amp;egrave;me before bed (because of it&#x27;s thick consistency and</li>
<li> I thought it was my imagination until I went on-line and discovered that others had also noticed a serious change in the product.  </li>
<li> /&gt;As if the rash wasn&#x27;t bad enough, this supposed oil-free moisturizer gave my face a shiny, greasy appearance the two days I wore it</li>
<li> This not only doesn&#x27;t work as a sunscreen, but it also smells bad.</li>
<li> It is unfair for me to rate this product because it may have become frozen while it waited in a package on my doorstep in Minnesota for a few days before I opened it.</li>
<li> Any other 15 spf I use will keep my face protected for a day at in the sun, but they always small bad and cause breakouts.</li>
<li> As written by another reviewer, this product has changed (it is now &amp;#34;broad spectrum&amp;#34;) and has a horrible smell.  </li>
<li> It has that same horrible smell like all the other sunscreens and it does not work.</li>
<li> but the new version has a horrible chemical smell.</li>
<li> I hated the sticky almost sweaty appearance it left on my face.</li>
<li> New version has a weird watermelon fragrance that is terrible.  </li>
<li> but I&#x27;m wrong.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m afraid to use any Neutrogena product again...</li>
<li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with the product and with amazon for falsely advertising this product.  </li>
<li> It also smells bad now.</li>
<li> The sunblock doesn&#x27;t make it smell bad and this could be used anytime and anywhere.</li>
<li> I am so disappointed with this product.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
<li> Very disappointing.</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>
<li> I am very disappointed, and will not be buying this product again.</li>
<li> A horrible, chemical scent that you can&#x27;t get away from.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very good, all that could be expected</li>
    <li> I am a guy, not high maintenance. I wake up with dry skin around my mouth each morning. Ive tried many lotions, some were too oily, some didn&#x27;t moisturize. I don&#x27;t know how I ran into this bottle but I haven&#x27;t bought anything other than this for the past 10 years. I only need one small squeeze each morning. If you are like me this will be all that you need. I cannot comment on other uses. This man approves!</li>
    <li> It is really my favorite lotion with spf, light easy to use, does not clog your pores. I have used it for several years. Never found anything better.</li>
    <li> This caused an allergic reaction to where I needed to to take allergy medication, to help the rash go away. However, I have this problem with most facial lotions sadly...</li>
    <li> another discntinued item from amazon, i love this moisterizer, need it to return though - seems like Amazon is not carrying Neutrogena products at all anymore. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I bought this moisturizer a week ago.  I used it for 2 days before I discovered on day three it was giving me a rash.  On day three I was rubbing it on and I felt bumps, not acne, just bumps along my jawline.  After I finished applying the moisturizer my face just burned.  I had pink blotches all over and have been super itchy.  I have not put anything on my face the past two days and I am still itching.  Also, it has a heavy sunscreen smell that lasts all day, and it is very thick and greasy.  I will never buy this again.</li>
    <li> How it feels: If I apply this moisturizer in the morning, my face gets shiny toward the end of the day. But most other moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried make my face shine right away. This product feels lighter, less oily, and less shiny than the following 3 brands:   - Cetaphil Fragrance Free Daily Facial Moisturizer, SPF 15   - Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream for Dry, Sensitve Skin   - Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel   How well it does its job: it&#x27;s effective on skin constantly made dry and sensitive by Benzoyl peroxide and Retin A products. If I overdo it, dry itchy skin usually gets back to normal after one application, and redness disappears after one-two hours. SPF 15 has worked well enough to protect against sun sensitivity caused by Retin A and the sun of South Bay Area, CA.   Adverse effects: None for me. I haven&#x27;t noticed any more clogging than with other products. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me (it barely smells).  My skin type: I have sensitive combination skin, which easily gets irritated and can break out after a single face scratch.   I&#x27;v also tried Aveeno, L&#x27;Oreal, and other well-known brands. This moisturizer is still my choice.</li>
    <li> Been using this for many years, mainly because in my area it&#x27;s suprisingly hard to find a moisturizer with an SPF15 content. Higher than that, and it&#x27;s marketed as sunscreen, and even I&#x27;m not that fanatic about protecting my skin.  Anyway. I have very fair, delicate, even wussy-like skin ;), and recently a more olive-skinned friend and I went to the suntanning salon to get a bit bronzed. I applied this only on my face and neck, as per usual, about 20 minutes before going in. I opted to go for the less intense salon at 10 minutes.  About an hour later, my whole body was the colour of a lobster...everywhere, flamingly burnt red. Everywhere, that is, but my face and neck! It did the job! I&#x27;m impressed. I&#x27;m a teacher and was literally squirming in front of my kids.  People always compliment me on my skin, and I used to wonder if my skin truly is protected with such a low SPF rating, but this did a lot towards convincing me.  Light, fragrance-free, ideal for delicate, fussy skin like mine. If only they&#x27;d come up with something in this price range for my crow&#x27;s eyes!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife who has very sensitive skin.  She was using cetaphil&#x27;s moisturizer and sometimes that would even sting.  She said she loves this and hasnt had any stinging or uncomfortable feeling leaving her skin feeling great.  Good product.</li>
    <li> I love this product it keeps my face moisturized throught out the day and also protects it from getting sunburnt. Its also nice to use under makeup helps it go on smoother for a better look as well!</li>
    <li> I wear this to go under my makeup that also has spf. It&#x27;s really helped to keep my face from getting too dark.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dude and I love this stuff.  I burn easily and it works.  Not greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer  for a few years. I have normal skin. I use it  all year around. Meaning, the concentration is good for my skin throughout all the seasons.  I&#x27;ve tried higher end moisturizers. They are good, but not worth me paying triple the price. It sinks into my skin ,and doesn&#x27;t make my face look greasy.</li>
    <li> i am using this on my hand and body. when i used it on my face it started shining for 15 minutes and then my face became greasy very fast... excellent for hand and body</li>
    <li> Loved this product for over 15 years.  New version has a weird watermelon fragrance that is terrible.  Not buying this anymore.  What a shame.</li>
    <li> Like it; believe it came promptly.</li>
    <li> This is all I use on my face. I have sensitive skin and love this product.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a oily residue and keeps my face from becoming dry.  I had dry skin on my face but I use this product a few times a day (especially after showering and shaving) and now - no dry skin at all.  I deeply recommend this product.</li>
    <li> ... and have to wear moisturizer and sunscreen everyday.  However, my face is also (oddly enough) very prone to breaking out.  I have used Olay, Aveeno, Cetaphil, various ultra-expensive brands;  This is the ONLY sunscreen/moisturizer that I have found that keeps my face from peeling from my eczema AND breaking out.  It also happens to feel lighter on my skin than anything else as well.  If I could only buy one product ever, this would be it.  My skin literally can&#x27;t go without it.  I do use the non-SPF version at night just because my husband doesn&#x27;t really like the smell of sunscreen, and it works just as well.  I have to use the SPF during the day though and I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I used this product for years before switching to the Neutrogena Healthy Skin formulation, which contains glycolic acid. I loved this moisturizer. I did not find it too oily or greasy - one of the reasons that I switched to it was becuase I found it to be much lighter than the Clinique Daily Moisturizing Lotion that I had been using. I could even use this product during the summer, when it is very hot and humid where I live. Neutrogena makes great products. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I been trying out a lot of face creams, I have went from Ponds to St. Eves to Olay to L&#x27;Oreal and while they all moisturized my face I hated the sticky almost sweaty appearance it left on my face. But this moisturizer is perfect! My face feels soft and hydrated without the stickiness. Definitely a keeper!    (Got this at my local CVS for $9.79)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years under my make-up.  It is moisturizing w/o being oily. The SPF is just right for my skin.  Higher SPF reacts adversely w/ my chemistry. When I sweat and it mixes w/ a higher SPF product I develop skin poisoning if I&#x27;m out in the sun.</li>
    <li> I have used this moisturizer for a long time and I love it. I have sensitive skin that is also break-out prone and my dermatologist actually recommended this product. I only broke out a tiny bit at the beginning but I know the spf is probably just making it a little more oily than I was used to. I kept using it and it has been fine.</li>
    <li> This used to be my favorite SPF face lotion for winter when I don&#x27;t need so high SPF but the new version has a horrible chemical smell. Someone else noted the addition of avobenzone is the change in the &amp;#34;broad spectrum SPF 15&amp;#34; version so beware of the smell.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena changed their formula for this.  I can no longer use because it burns when I apply. It also smells bad now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay with SPF for years, and decided I&#x27;d like to try something new.  This Neutrogena feels really good on my skin, goes on smoothly, and seems to keep my skin feeling soft for a long time.  I like the pump bottle - the Olay was a squeeze and pour, and I was always getting too much or too little.  I&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
    <li> i have been using it for a while. it is awesome. i strongly recommend it. the price is also very reasonable. i will continue using it</li>
    <li> I have used neutrogena for years, and they have a \\&quot;thick\\&quot; moisturizer, and a \\&quot;runny&#x27; moisturizer.  This is def. the runny one.  Both come in the pump bottles so it is easy to pick the wrong one.  Works good, though.  I personally prefer the thicker formula.</li>
    <li> Wonderful moisturizer than adds moisture without oil just as advertised. I use it here in Arizona before my lap swims and after a summer of 4-5 sessions a week, plus other outdoor activity, my skin feels soft and not at all dry or sun damaged. This is because it stays on and since it is not oil I let it stay on rather than wipe it off without thinking. Neutrogena triumphs again.</li>
    <li> This face lotion works just as well or better than any other &amp;#34;drug-store&amp;#34; brand that I&#x27;ve tried, and most &amp;#34;department store&amp;#34; brands that I&#x27;ve tried.  Don&#x27;t let the plaqin packaging and low price fool you - this stuff works great!</li>
    <li> This used to be one of my favorite facial sunscreens. It was light, non-greasy, and best of all: it didn&#x27;t contain avobenzone. I, and many others, am sensitive to avobenzone. It causes my eyes to sting and burn and even after washing the product off, the stinging continues for a while. Finding a good sunscreen that does not contain avobenzone is a challenge, and this was a good one. It was, anyway. With the change, I can no longer use this product. Very disappointed. I didn&#x27;t even find out about the change until I put it on and my eyes started to sting.</li>
    <li> Used and loved the original product for 40 years!  When I was frequently complimented on my skin, I would recommend this moisturizer, which was absolutely perfect in every way.  Several weeks ago I opened a new bottle and was shocked to discover a peculiar scent, and a change in consistency.  I thought it was my imagination until I went on-line and discovered that others had also noticed a serious change in the product.  The new product also makes my eyes and lips sting, and my face does not feel moisturized.   I am heartbroken that one of my all-time favorite products has disappeared.  Will be seeking a different brand unless Neutrogena brings back the original formula of this formerly perfect product.</li>
    <li> Finding a facial moisturizer is a pain in the butt. Finding one that does not give me zits or a whole in my wallet was driving me nuts. Not no more. I have been using this product for over a year now and its great. Small amounts needed at a time, great size for travel and also easy on the wallet. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion, great add-on!</li>
    <li> Girlfriend says it leaves her skin oily</li>
    <li> My daughter feels that this makes her face oily.  She prefers the moisturizer with out the SPF.  Her pimples have gotten a little worse since she&#x27;s been using this product.</li>
    <li> This product is good. The sunblock doesn&#x27;t make it smell bad and this could be used anytime and anywhere. I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim while I was browsing around a drug store.  I wanted a moisturizer that contained SPF since I was otherwise using Shiseido Sun Protection Cream, which I thought was a little too thick (and pretty expensive) for everyday wear.  I saw that this was selling for less than $10 (should have been my first red flag) and, while I never personally used Neutrogena brands, I always thought it was a somewhat decent brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I used it for two consecutive days on my face and neck, applying it before heading out to work.  On the afternoon of the second day, I noticed this sensitivity along my lower cheeks going to my mouth area as well as a red rash around my neck.  As soon as I got home that day, I washed with soap and water.  That night and into the morning of next day, that area of my face was red and swollen and there were little bumps that were weeping clear fluid (yuck!).  As of the writing of this review, the skin around my mouth is still tight-feeling and darker in appearance than the rest of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As if the rash wasn&#x27;t bad enough, this supposed oil-free moisturizer gave my face a shiny, greasy appearance the two days I wore it and my skin is normally pretty dry.  So on top of it messing up my face, it doesn&#x27;t even do what it claims to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I should have done more research before making purchases on things that go on my face.  At least four other Amazon customers had the same rash/allergy from using this product.  I&#x27;m going back to using Shiseido once this skin ailment clears up.  Maybe this will be good for hand lotion, at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** As an update, I contacted Neutrogena about what this product did to my face.  Their customer service was very helpful and pleasant and was very quick about sending me a refund.  So while I&#x27;m still giving this product a 1 star, Neutrogena, as a company, should get 5 stars for their customer service.</li>
    <li> This stuff helps my skin and doesn&#x27;t break me out. It is more like a lotion than a cream. I like how it has sunscreen in it to protect my face.</li>
    <li> Simply put, my favorite face lotion.  No oily residue, goes on smoothly and provides SPF.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I ordered my second bottle!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this stuff is fantastic. It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue behind and also doubles as a light sunscreen. I use it year round, and am an avid outdoorsy type. It kept my skin from getting too dry over the winter, and keeps it from being too oily in the summer. This is a great product, 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Love this! Good for my sensitive skin. Use it daily and have not gotten sunburned. :)</li>
    <li> I only used it for twice a day for 2 days and it already started breaking me out! I gave it to my friend and it broke him out too, almost instantly. NOT for acne-prone skin!</li>
    <li> I was pretty disappointed in this product.  I gave it two stars because it is a name brand product and, in all fairness, my eyes could be particularly sensitive and my response is not necessarily a universal one, but it was pretty severe.  By the end of the day, my eyes were burning and I had to use eye drops several times to alleviate the pain.  I know it was the moisturizer because it was the only new product that I had used that week.  It took me several days to realize what was going on, but the pain stopped when I stopped using this product, so it was a pretty clear-cut connection.</li>
    <li> Great for after shaving.</li>
    <li> Solid product and shipped as promised.</li>
    <li> Great product for someone (like me) with oily skin. It&#x27;s really light and easily absorbed so you won&#x27;t get that greasy feeling on your face that&#x27;s typical from some moisturizers.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. It&#x27;s clean, non-greasy, doesn&#x27;t give me acne. I use it after every shower and shave. As a male, I prefer it over all the other, even expensive, &amp;#34;for men&amp;#34; face lotions. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years, and now keep it on subscribe and save every 3 months.</li>
    <li> I tried this after using ROC face lotion for 6 months. I don&#x27;t like it. It feels like you are putting on a sunscreen, not a lotion. Also, my skin has been redder. I have rosacea, and apparently, this is irritating my skin. If I can&#x27;t return it, I&#x27;ll throw it away.</li>
    <li> No matter what I use to clean my face, I still need moisturizer or it feels dry. I&#x27;d tried Purpose, which is an excellent brand, but more expensive. I&#x27;m ordering more of this product because it&#x27;s really good. If you dampen your face first, then apply lightly, it won&#x27;t feel greasy at all. And a tissue smoothed lightly over your face will remove any extra, unnecessary product.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer works. Period. I&#x27;ve used it for 10+ years. That being said, they recently changed the formula to a &amp;#34;broad spectrum&amp;#34; sunscreen. I never got sunburned with the old formula, so I don&#x27;t know why they bothered changing it. The original moisturizer had little to no scent at all. The new version being sold by amazon has a cucumber-like smell to it. It DOES fade within a few minutes, but it&#x27;s definitely a change from the original stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new formula also causes burning the first couple of times I used it. I don&#x27;t have any problems at all with burning now, so maybe it&#x27;s just when you first start using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cancelled my subscription to this product after I discovered the new smell, but after using the new stuff for a few months, with the exception of the smell, it seems to produce the same results. And I never found anything else that was better, so I guess I&#x27;ll be sticking with this for a while.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed with this product. Even though it is supposed to be oil free it turns my skin into a greaseball right after I apply it. It also takes forever to absorb into skin. It smells extremely strongly of sunblock and has the same consistency. Did not feel moisturized at all.</li>
    <li> got a major rash from putting it on the first time and I didn&#x27;t use anything else.  my whole face was practically swollen. I scared alot of people with my face.  I had to put alot of steroid cream for the swelling to go down.  It took a couple of days for my face to get back to normal.</li>
    <li> My favorite moisturizer... very good fro dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin, but it is also acne prone due to its sensitivity to chemicals. I usually don&#x27;t have TOO much of a problem with breakouts (unless my aunt Flo is in town) so I didn&#x27;t have to wash my face with anything more than a damp wash cloth. However, I tried Biotin supplements for my hair and nails and it gave me cystic ance! So I washed my face with raw, liquid black soap and applied this at night and woke up the next morning with nearly flawless skin. I KID YOU NOT by the second/third day of using it my skin was moisturized, it wasn&#x27;t greasy, and my skin tone was brightened and evening up. I will advise that you only use it before you go to bed and wash with just water in the morning as it can make you shiny later on in the day if you&#x27;re not applying any make up. Overall, it does its job and what is promised on the package. I first used it as a sample product and will now be a lifelong customer.</li>
    <li> I like this moisturizer, it keeps my skin nice moisturized. Works really well for my oily skin. And the spf of 15 is a plus.</li>
    <li> Good product. My combination skin gets the moisture I need without making me breakout. What more can you ask? I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Neut Oil Free with SPF. dermatologist suggested. Great cover for the Florida sun. And the price was right on Amazon. Great product.</li>
    <li> im 13 and i love neutrogena products. i bought this from target and it was $10. i have been using it only for a little while but i noticed it made my skin super soft!! and spf in a moisturizer is awesome, and the fact that it is no comedogenic (srry idk how to spell that??) i would totally recommed this, i have sort of oily skin and i think i just need to buy some blotting wipes or something like that, elf ahve some 150 for $3!! but i think that theres nothing that will stop the oil from coming out through the moisturizer or your makeup. if that makes sense. hope this helped :) good luck</li>
    <li> This item is exactly as described and it came at an excellent price and shipped ultra-fast via PRIME... great deal!!!</li>
    <li> Got it way before estimated time  this product is what I needed will tell  you all later how it&#x27;s been doing. my face is quite red allot of the time.&lt;br /&gt;Update: Makes my face feel good and soft take care of the red. Good price too.</li>
    <li> I tried this product because it was less expensive than Aveeno&#x27;s moisturizer with the same SPF.  Plus it said &amp;#34;oil-free&amp;#34;.  It does the job and my skin did not burn, but it leaves a greasy film on your skin.  Also, you may want to avoid rubbing the moisturizer around your eyes because unlike Aveeno, it will sting.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin very shiny. When I squeeze some in my hand, it&#x27;s watery. Feels like it sits on my skin vs. absorbing it. I use it as a back up now if I run out of my Origins face cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisturizer for many years.  I&#x27;ve tried other moisturizers but consider this one to be the best.  It is fragrance-free and gentle on my skin.  It goes on smooth and does not feel oily or sticky.  It makes my skin feel soft and comfortable and has never given me breakouts.  I use this moisturizer (with the SPF 15) during the day under my makeup and I use the one without the SPF (Neutrogena Oil-Free Sensitive Skin) at night.  Both types are great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years now and love it!  It&#x27;s oil free, without any significant scent, and is effective as a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I never have breakouts with this stuff. I&#x27;ve tried other types of oil-free face moisturizers, but this is the only one that does not cause acne. Love it.</li>
    <li> I use most Neutrogena products, they are very effective and does not irritate my skin.  Price is very reasonable, I love the products, I always make sure I do not run out.</li>
    <li> This is an ok moisturizing lotion, but Neutrogena has others, that are even better. Their oil-free moisture lotion seems to go on too thick (compared to other products) and gives my skin a greasy, shiny, look when worn under makeup. I use it instead as a nighttime moisturizing cr&amp;egrave;me before bed (because of it&#x27;s thick consistency and shine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are times when my skin gets especially dry and the moisture provided here, would not be enough. I would have to keep re-applying and re-applying on my especially dry skin, sometimes many times throughout the day. (I would need a more intense moisturizing product during those times). The moisture provided from this product isn&#x27;t always enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena has a lot of very excellent skin moisturizing products. I also use their \\&quot;Healthy Defense daily moisturizer\\&quot; with tint, to use underneath makeup and add a touch of color to the face. That one goes on a little thick too, but it&#x27;s worth it to have a natural glow. And it is more of a matte finish, without the oil or shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite is the \\&quot;Neutrogena Visibly Even moisturizer\\&quot; which I am able to apply both day and night, as it goes on very smooth, thin, and light. I find it most excellent for daytime use and it even provides a nice healthy glow. The \\&quot;visibly even\\&quot;  Neutrogena product has added essential soy&#x27;s and extra moisturizing ingredients to deal with even the driest of skins. It contains just the right amount of moisturizers to help my skin on the most driest of days, without being too thick and creamy, or greasy. It also covers skin blotches and dark spots as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before purchasing this facial moisturizer for the first time, I would take a look at some others that are out there. Do some comparasing and get the product that is right for you. There are so many out there to choose from, and Neutrogena, in particular, offers a wide array of skin products, for practically any skin type. This model is just their most basic one.</li>
    <li> Great non-oily product to protect your skin.&lt;br /&gt;SPF 15 is not the strongest anymore, but it works for myself and my husband.</li>
    <li> Not sure how oil-free this product actually is.  Albeit water-.base, the texture is medium-heavy. I highly recommend it for the neck, where it&#x27;s quite safe, but am skeptical about the face.</li>
    <li> As written by another reviewer, this product has changed (it is now &amp;#34;broad spectrum&amp;#34;) and has a horrible smell.  I&#x27;ve used this same lotion since 1998!  And now it has changed and amazon duped me into buying it.  I&#x27;m very disappointed with the product and with amazon for falsely advertising this product.  This makes me think they knew that the product was not the same (and people wouldn&#x27;t like it) so they tried to off-load it by making it a subscribe and save item.  I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have had almost NO allergies to food or products in the past, but this lotion seemed to cause a strange breakout of small bumps on the INSIDE of my mouth!  For several weeks I tried to figure out what was causing this unusual texture in the mouth, under and above my lips.  Note that I had no obvious symptoms on my face, only inside my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happened to be at the dentist during this time and he didn&#x27;t know what it was either, except that it was likely due to a recent change in something I was consuming.  I tried eliminating several things, but finally I wondered if this lotion was causing the breakout and within a few days of stopping use of this product the bumps have disappeared and not returned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am all for having sunblock in my moisturizer, but this one feels and smells a lot more like sunblock than as an oil free moisturizer.  It is not bad, but I think that there are better oil free moisturizers out there.</li>
    <li> I needed an oil free sunscreen for my face that would not cause breakouts and I cant stand the smell of sunscreen so I spent the extra money to get this Neutrogena Oil free moisture with sunscreen. What a waste of money! It has that same horrible smell like all the other sunscreens and it does not work. Any other 15 spf I use will keep my face protected for a day at in the sun, but they always small bad and cause breakouts. This not only doesn&#x27;t work as a sunscreen, but it also smells bad.Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> For years now this has been my go to daily moisturizer and it has worked very well BUT I recently discovered that the new bottle I bought has no UVA/UVB Broad Spectrum protection! In fact the front of the bottle says &amp;#34;New Warnings&amp;#34; listed on reverse. On the reverse, it clearly states that it will &amp;#34;not prevent skin cancer or early skin aging.&amp;#34; Conclusion: Time to move onto another brand that offers more, not less.</li>
    <li> Compared to the previous review, this moisturizer has  no necessary oil  in it, making it feel like it&#x27;s not there, after you&#x27;ve applied it.  So you have to use alot more to feel like it&#x27;s there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal Neutrogena user for over 10 years -- but when I moved from the cool east coast to dry, sunny southern California, I decided to upgrade from Neutrogena Combination Skin Moisturizer to this product. It smelled a little like sunblock, which didn&#x27;t bother me, but when I awoke the following morning after applying, my jawline, cheeks, and neck were red, bumpy, and super super itchy! I assume it will go away in a day, but this moisturizer is going in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;1 week later, the rash is almost gone. There are still patches of dry, rough skin left here and there, and I suspect they will be gone altogether in the next few days. The difference between the texture of my face after applying the product (rough, itchy, bumpy) to what it was before (normal) is staggering! I&#x27;m afraid to use any Neutrogena product again...I don&#x27;t know what it was that caused such a reaction on my face!</li>
    <li> I have used the Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture, SPF 15 for over 2 years. It was great, but Neutrogena changed the formula sometime back in 2013. Before the change, it was the perfect facial moisturizer for my acne prone face. It left it moisturized without irritation or clogging my pores or even making my face look oily (I usually have that problem). To top it off it offered a little sun protection. Now, they have changed the formula resulting in itchy irritated skin every time i have used this product since buying it (I&#x27;ve used it everyday for 2 whole weeks hoping that the moisturizer wasn&#x27;t the problem). I am very disappointed, and will not be buying this product again. For new buyers, just know that everyone&#x27;s skin is different, and maybe this new formula may work for you, but just don&#x27;t read reviews written before 2014 FOR THE SPF 15 because that is for a different product than the current version Neutrogena is selling. If you are NOT buying the SPF 15, check online to see if they have changed the formula of the product you want to buy so you can know which reviews are relevant to your purchase (aka, if you must disregard the old reviews that were written for an older version of the product).</li>
    <li> great moisturizer always goes on well I cant find a better product for my face that is so well priced</li>
    <li> This is a horrible product from neutrogena, I bought it because it was oil free and its packed with tons of oil and man made chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah and if you have a scar on your face, DONT USE!!! It will make your old scare turn bright red and it almost makes your scare stand out 10x more than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product should be recalled, I guess its off to wholefoods or trader joes for some organic oil free moisturizer</li>
    <li> It is unfair for me to rate this product because it may have become frozen while it waited in a package on my doorstep in Minnesota for a few days before I opened it. It is now rather runny, possibly as a result. I&#x27;ll try it again later.</li>
    <li> Skin feels smooth and it leaves your face not feeling slippery.  It also doesn&#x27;t make your face shiny. That being said, SPF 15 isn&#x27;t enough, so I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday.  It feels light and refreshing with no unpleasant ordor.  If you are looking for a good product, try this.</li>
    <li> It feels less oily than other products i have tried.</li>
    <li> At first I was hesitant, I was thinking should I get this one or should I get the men one. The price was the mind changing factor in my opinion, and it did fulfill the needs I was expecting. Nice face skin :)</li>
    <li> I usually like Neutrogena and am loyal to their other facial products. This product is too greasy and leaves my face shiny. It feels like a film. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband. One of the cheaper product out there with SPF.</li>
    <li> I was very eager to buy this face moisturizer when I saw that it&#x27;s oil free but got disappointed because it still brings oil to my face in less than an hour after applying it! So I really don&#x27;t know now which brand to trust whenever they claim such things on their products nevertheless I&#x27;m still using it since I  found a way to at least diminish the oiliness on my face after applying it.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic moisturizer!  My skin is prone to breaking out when I use moisturizers, even those that are oil free, but this one doesn&#x27;t do that to me.  And I getting the SPF 15 protection.</li>
    <li> I was a loyal Neutrogena product user for years, but now that I see their ingredients include Oxybenzone (3% in this product) -which can disrupt the hormone system among other side effects. Check out the EWG guide to sunscreens and other products on the hall of shame and see what products they recommend here:  http://www.ewg.org/2015sunscreen/hall-of-shame/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, Neurtogena, I expected effective, affordable and SAFE products from you.</li>
    <li> was looking for a facial moisturizer that had SPF and wasn&#x27;t oily, and i decided to try this one to see how it compared to more expensive ones (like the Menscience moisturizer).  it definitely is light and i like it but it doesn&#x27;t leave the face as nice feeling as the more expensive Menscience Advanced Face Lotion.  however, that product doesn&#x27;t have SPF, so i went with the Neutrogena, which does the job fine and is a good price.  i&#x27;m not that fancy.  yet.</li>
    <li> Less greasy than other oil-free products, and I haven&#x27;t gotten any breakouts. It sometimes still feels/looks a little greasy, but better than the other oil free moisturizers that I had been using.</li>
    <li> I bought this to supplement my skin care regimen and I love how moisturizing it is without feeling heavy. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Neutrogena Oil-free Moisture for years.  I&#x27;m well over 60 but strangers keep commenting on the fact that I my still is smooth.</li>
    <li> Good sun screen for being &amp;#34;out and about&amp;#34;. It is not smelly or sticky.</li>
    <li> I was afraid that the good price could not ensure the quality but I&#x27;m wrong. My skin is really sensitive and oil and this one works really well!</li>
    <li> Works beautifully. I naturally have oily skin, so every now and then I&#x27;ll take a piece of tissue to wipe the remaining excess oil off my skin. Overall, I&#x27;m happily satisfied!</li>
    <li> I bought it so that I can use it for winter and so far it&#x27;s working out</li>
    <li> What I like about this product is it contains spf, is non-comedogenic, is not fragrant, feels good on my skin and doesn&#x27;t need to be replaced too often. One bottle lasts several months.</li>
    <li> Provides sun protection and moisturizes skin - the perfect combination.  I may try the SPF 35 one next. Not oily and it absorbs quickly into skin.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and have struggled with moisturizers for a long time. This one does the trick though. It gets absorbed quickly and is truly non-greasy.</li>
    <li> This used to be my favorite face moisturizing lotion.  However, the new version apparently has a new formulation with &amp;#34;broad spectrum SPF 15&amp;#34; rather than &amp;#34;SPF 15&amp;#34;.  The difference?  A horrible, chemical scent that you can&#x27;t get away from.  The old version had three sunscreen ingredients: Octinoxate, Octisalate, and Oxybenzone.  The new version has 4 sunscreen ingredients: Avobenzone, Octisalate, Octocrylene, and Oxybenzone.  Amazon has not updated the product photos to accurately reflect the new ingredients.  Beware, if you are at all sensitive to scents, you may find this product repulsive.  After 10 years of loving Neutrogena oil-free moisture, I guess I will have to find something else.</li>
    <li> nice lotion, recommended by our dermatologist</li>
    <li> I am in my fifties.  My determatologist always told me always to use this brand because its great for sensitive skin like I have and moisturizer always keeps your skin moist and younger.</li>
