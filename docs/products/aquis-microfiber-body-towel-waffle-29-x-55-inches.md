      <li>Perfect!</li>
      <li>br /&gt;It makes a very good sports towel and I&#x27;ll probably be taking one with me now when I travel after experiencing the \\&quot;sandpaper\\&quot; towels some motels have.  </li>
      <li>and they are still in very good condition.</li>
      <li>The greatest benefit of all though, is the improvement in the health of my hair that I have experienced.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;m thrilled!</li>
      <li>Be sure to get the waffle weave, and of course, Amazon has the best prices.</li>
      <li>Wish they came in more colors, so I dyed mine - perfect!</li>
      <li>She loved it.</li>

      <li>We are very pleased with our purchase.</li>
      <li>Truly elegant towel, but also great for the gym or camping trips.  </li>
      <li>Very satisfied with this one.</li>
      <li>I love microfiber towels!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Love these towels!</li>
      <li>This towel picks up water better than any material I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
      <li>i then put the aquis microfiber body towel in the dryer by itself and i&#x27;m pleased to say that no lint came off of it!</li>
      <li>I purchased two of these amazing towels.  </li>
      <li>This towel is amazing.</li>
      <li>These are nice bath towels.</li>
      <li>I had read how nice microfiber towels were.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s nice to know that this towel will not lose it&#x27;s softness over time-</li>
      <li>My home is exceptionally humid as compared to most homes in the U.S.  </li>
      <li>This super size towel is great for after shower and hair or take it to the gym.</li>
      <li>Lightweight and suitable for trips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>While its  a great choice for those kinds of travels, I&#x27;m using it at home too and it is perfect - just as warm but way thinner than my usual towels.</li>
      <li>I will probably buy another for a trip - we will be packing very light and not always staying at hotels.</li>
      <li>Defenitely great for those who like to travel light and still have a full size towel.</li>
      <li>It dries quickly and feels good.  </li>
      <li>All the more reason why I love this towel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wish it came in more colors.</li>
      <li>I love this towel.  </li>
      <li>but you will soon grow to love it.  </li>
      <li>Once most of the water is removed then you can \\&quot;towel down\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I had to fined another place where to purchase 22 more bath towels.  </li>
      <li>I am going to buy more when my girls are teenagers.  </li>
      <li>Aquis towels are the best I&#x27;ve ever used--and the only ones I&#x27;ll use from now on.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t mind a somewhat unconventional feel, you will love these towels.</li>
      <li>hope to find more diversity of colors</li>
      <li>Offer more hues</li>
      <li>i love these absorbent and quick-drying towels.</li>
      <li>I am 63 and this is simply the best towel I have ever owned.</li>
      <li>and i&#x27;m glad</li>
      <li>glad i didn&#x27;t purchase the specialized hair towel from aquis.</li>
      <li>I love this towel and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
      <li>It just works better then</li>
      <li>but they can cover some surface area! :)</li>
      <li>I loved my towels because they are light weight and easier to fit in my gym bag, they are super absorbant and I can wrap it well around myself!</li>
      <li>I am so excited about this towel!</li>
      <li>I have used these towels for years and still like them better than my big&lt;br /&gt;thick towels as the Aquis drys my hair and myself very quickly.</li>
      <li>I also bought the one designed specifically for hair, but I perfer this one because it is more comfortable and seems to absorb better.</li>
      <li>I love the waffle texture over the smooth but have plenty of both styles.  </li>
      <li>... and, at first, I did love it!</li>
      <li>It does do a very good job it absorbing water and dries extremely fast.  </li>
      <li>Pulls a lot of moisture from the hair and the generous size makes it easy to towel off</li>
      <li>Stains don&#x27;t wash out so easily, and the towel will start losing shape with washings.</li>
      <li>The bleach does the job though, even when washed in warm water (vs. hot).  </li>
      <li>everything was fine.</li>
      <li>Dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t stink like many specialty towels you use for&lt;br /&gt;Travel.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s pretty much the best towel purchase I&#x27;ve ever made, but that isn&#x27;t saying much.</li>
      <li>so I can get rid of all my huge, bulky, inefficient cotton towels.</li>
      <li>so it would fit in my gym bag.</li>
      <li>Sales rep confirmed that their microfiber is indeed split.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love love the absorbency of microfiber, and the lightweight quality of Aquis&#x27; style, size and functionality has happily replaced every heavy cotton bath towel in the house.  </li>
      <li>It was good at first but after the first wash the ends started to fray</li>
      <li>However, once you get used to using it, you will find it dries you very quickly and dries quickly on the rack.</li>
      <li>I have been using this each morning on my hair for about 2 months and have noticed a significant increase in the shine and smoothess of my hair.  </li>
      <li>Worth the money!</li>
      <li>I experienced being way more dry after hot yoga and a shower than I have been when using cotton towels.  </li>
      <li>I was able to wash my hair right after dinner, when it was most convenient, and go to bed with dry hair thanks to this great towel.</li>
      <li>I needed a towel which was very light and compact, so I ended up with one from REI, which while not as pretty will fit my needs far better.</li>
      <li>am still using my 1st one after several years but wanted another for the summer.&lt;br /&gt;So great to take to the pool or lake because they don&#x27;t take up much room in your bag and are so absorbent!</li>
      <li>My favorite thing about this is how fast the towel itself dries after it removes moisture from you.  </li>
      <li>I needed a thinner towel to take to the gym and to yoga because I have a gym bag that is SO FULL already.  </li>
      <li>Love that this dries so fast.</li>
      <li>Most absorbing towel I ever had.</li>
      <li>The feel is a bit rubbery but not bad.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not using it in some super humid environment or to accomplish any special task, just for myself after I shower.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)  Saves me minutes by absorbing water from my hair more quickly when it&#x27;s wrapped in the towel.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;m pleased with them and think their worth a try but will probably want to have a large cotton towel in my bathroom -</li>
      <li>One other great thing is that it dries quickly.</li>
      <li>i may receive some flack for this, but i&#x27;m one of those OCD people who has to have a fresh, clean towel after every shower (lots of laundry).</li>
      <li>Towel warmers are lost on them since the heat dissipates quickly.</li>
      <li>It dries you off really quick</li>
      <li>Dries quickly and I&#x27;ve become accustomed to the feel of it.  </li>
      <li>This towel is all about drying you off quick</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like no other kind of towel.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great to get so dry so fast!</li>
      <li>Wrapped around me easily to tuck in for getting ready at the gym.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll definitely order more!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d want them for an everyday towel because of the lack of plushness, but they&#x27;ll be great for travel.</li>
      <li>Perhaps more frequent washings would help.  </li>
      <li>Worth the price.</li>
      <li>These towels are the most absorbent towels I have met, but they are not the soft, plush towels that belonged in a five star hotel.</li>
      <li>I completely disagree with &amp;#34;pros and cons&amp;#34; review, because we have enjoyed the beige waffle body towels for 7 years now</li>
      <li>I say that for three reasons: 1) It absorbs water faster and more completely, 2)</li>
      <li>They are great to travel with too, they take up very little space in the luggage bag.</li>
      <li>takes up little space in the linen closet and provides more absorbancy that the best, fluffy towel.  </li>
      <li>I just like the feel of a good rub down with a plush towel after a shower.   </li>
      <li>The waffle weave aquis towel is the best on the market for wet hair and wet bodies.</li>
      <li>It is so gentle on the skin, as it quickly absorbs moisture.</li>
      <li>soft, waffle weave feels great on my body and does not &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34; on my wet skin.</li>
      <li>Good for compact towel needs during travel or gym, but does not slide well along the skin (kind of grips you), which feels weird.</li>
      <li>I wash it in the machine (sometimes gentle sometimes normal cycle, either is fine) with woolite and NO fabric softner.</li>
      <li>I will consider it reasonable if they hold up to a year of fun and sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so it fits in my gym bag with ease, and it dries soooo fast!  </li>
      <li>This is my first Microfiber towel.</li>
      <li>i had purchased another brand for my trailer, but it was not made as well, and did not keep its shape after the first use.</li>
      <li>:) we bought two dozen egyptian cotton towels a couple weeks back</li>
      <li>well, i am willing to go two...</li>
      <li>It is really soft and comfortable to use and SO absorbent.</li>
      <li>This is my first one, but I&#x27;m definitely going to buy a couple more</li>
      <li>and i swear they become less soft after each laundry load and more and more lint comes off.</li>
      <li>I received it as a gift and liked it so much I purchased for other gifts.</li>
      <li>It was a present for my Boss last christmas, and she really liked.it was in good condition, the product satisfice my exoectatives</li>
      <li>Getting dry after a shower takes notably longer here</li>
      <li>Then the towels themselves dry like magic.</li>
      <li>Dries very quickly on the rack and in the drier, so it doesn&#x27;t get that must smell some traditional towels get.</li>
      <li>The only downside is that the material is a bit grippy, so it won&#x27;t slide along your skin easily.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a large towel</li>
      <li>It was large and luxurious.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t last long as my favorite towel, but I still like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light.</li>
      <li>Fold very flat and tucks easily</li>
      <li>Very absorbent.</li>
      <li>she really likes it a lot.</li>
      <li>The aquis amicrofiber body towel, waffle white (29x55 inches is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>This towel is very absorbent.  </li>
      <li>I recommend this towel for the whole family.   </li>
      <li>Its lightweight yet very sturdy.  </li>
      <li>They do not take up much room in the washer.  </li>
      <li>So much nicer than terry cloth.</li>
      <li>Performed much better than I expected.</li>
      <li>/&gt;i took a shower and had a cotton towel for my hair and the aquis microfiber body towel ready for once the water stopped.</li>
      <li>OK, first off, if you&#x27;re looking for a nice fluffy, soft, comfy towel to dry off with, keep looking.  </li>
      <li>Work really well, and dry very quickly.  </li>
      <li>Even better, it doesn&#x27;t make my curls frizzy the way a couple of other brands of microfiber towels have done, even ones without the waffle weave.</li>
      <li>You can air dry or put it in the dryer, either is fine, but no dryer sheets.</li>
      <li>Lightweight, not bulky (great for a gym bag), and very thirsty towels are not very costly and last a  long time.</li>
      <li>In more typical circumstances, bleaching might not be needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>a quick blowdry only lasts 3 minutes.  </li>
      <li>, i have very sensitive skin and my eczema flares up from being in the water too much</li>
      <li>But this light little towel, dries better,  used to feel moist still with the cotton towel and hang it up and dry in a hour or so.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>suspect that the high humidity in my home, coupled with washing the towel just twice a week, probably causes the need to add bleach.  </li>
      <li>highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very thin and perfect for camping or just use it like you would a regular bath size towel.</li>
      <li>highly recommend.</li>
      <li>The waffle weave is far better than the other microweave towels Aquis and others make.</li>
      <li>It dries in a flash, and is soft and plenty large to wrap around oneself after a shower.  </li>
      <li>They dry you quickly and then seem to dry quickly on the rack, though I haven&#x27;t timed them or anything!</li>
      <li>These are so soft and really absorb water well.</li>
      <li>Very absorbant, soft, and packs well.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t glide over your skin like a normal towel.  </li>
      <li>also, it was dry within an hour or so which is rather astonishing as the cotton towel i had on my head for only two minutes is still damp.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use it at the gym and it is large enough to wrap around a large man.</li>
      <li>My daughter uses the towel for her super long hair and loves it.</li>
      <li>However, this is easy to adjust to, so it&#x27;s not worth taking a star away.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It dries quickly, and I feel dry when I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
      <li>so i like that i can dry off quickly with this towel without aggravating my skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the same size as a regular bath towel, but it honestly doesn&#x27;t need to be unless you like to wrap it around yourself for coverage after you dry off.</li>
      <li>its great and would be hard to go back to a regular cotton towel now....</li>
      <li>With my traditional towels, I have to wash them in hot water with bleach to prevent</li>
      <li>29 x 55 inches is the perfect size for my thick, long hair (halfway down myback).</li>
      <li>i realized very quickly that this was unnecessary as i was able to furiously dry myself as i would with a cotton towel!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind that it doesn&#x27;t glide much because it&#x27;s so much faster to get dry with this towel.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m dry right away.</li>
      <li>Its very light weight and even wet does not weigh anything like a wet cotton towel.   </li>
      <li>With my other towels, I didn&#x27;t realize how many times I had to go over my skin to thoroughly dry</li>
      <li>I have an old house with window units for A/C (not efficient at eliminating humidity in the house).  </li>
      <li>I continue to get ready until all that is left is my hair.  </li>
      <li>It absorbs moisture from short hair so fast you&#x27;ll think you used a hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>Many people complained of the dye coming off onto their dogs fur.  </li>
      <li>I waws surprised at how absorbant it is</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re soft and absorbent and do not shed lint as terry cloth often does.</li>
      <li>WOW...</li>
      <li>Over time, though, as some reviewers have mentioned, it has developed a greyish hue.</li>
      <li>I would convert our whole household to Aquis towels but keep some regular towels around because of the skeptics that visit.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really make the body totally day</li>
      <li>maybe three...showers without washing this towel just because of how soft it is.</li>
      <li>it was worth the money spent.</li>
      <li>It is small and compact and easy to travel with.</li>
      <li>Pretty much one pat on any part of your skin is enough to dry it!</li>
      <li>After a couple of hours it&#x27;s ready to dry you off again like new.</li>
      <li>, the only difference is it&#x27;s labeled as a \\&quot;Pet Towel\\&quot; but is exactly the same size and material.   </li>
      <li>loved this towel so much that I bought the same one for my 20-year-old niece who has long, thick hair that takes forever to dry.  </li>
      <li>Even better, and the main reason why I purchased these, is because they are light-weight and take up less space in the washer, as a result I do less loads of laundry, saves time, water and energy!</li>
      <li>I like these because they dry faster, don&#x27;t take up much space, et.</li>
      <li>and it was almost dry by the time I was ready to leave.  </li>
      <li>Very absorbent, and big enough to wrap my hair up turban style.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re not going to wipe it across your skin like a cotton towel, you pretty much have to blot the water off your skin - it will stick and drag across wet skin.  </li>
      <li>This towel is softer and more absorbent than cotton, even though it is less than half the thickness and weight of the cotton towels I used to use.</li>
      <li>By this time, my hair is just barely damp and</li>
      <li>More unnecessary chemicals for our furry friends.</li>
      <li>I use the same towel both times, and it&#x27;s perfectly dry when I&#x27;m ready to use it.</li>
      <li>The care instructions say you shouldn&#x27;t bleach the towel, and for a while I didn&#x27;t, but after a few weeks I found I needed to add a couple of teaspoons of bleach to the wash or it doesn&#x27;t smell quite right.  </li>
      <li>Aquis dry quickly and are soft and fluffy when hung out to dry--eliminating need to go in the dryer.</li>
      <li>The pulling feeling other reviewers have mentioned doesn&#x27;t bother me much, but it&#x27;s there.</li>
      <li>The washing instructions say to not dry them with fabric softener.</li>
      <li>my hair takes over 24 hours to dry (or 3 hours with a blow dryer or 90 minutes at a professional salon).</li>
      <li>When folded, even the large towel consumes little spaceon a shelf or in a suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also, my Aquis was a real life-saver on a late summer road trip in New England.</li>
      <li>The towel does not slide across wet skin pulling water with it so a new technique of patting must be learned, which can be tricky when drying one&#x27;s back.</li>
      <li>They are so much thinner and lightweight than regular towels - they take up less space in the washer.  </li>
      <li>I used to dry my traditional towels for 45-60 minutes on high to thoroughly dry</li>
      <li>live in an extremely humid environment on the Gulf Coast.  </li>
      <li>If you have never used a microfiber towel before it will be a little strange at first</li>

<li> This super size towel is great for after shower and hair or take it to the gym.</li>
<li> Lightweight and suitable for trips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> While its  a great choice for those kinds of travels, I&#x27;m using it at home too and it is perfect - just as warm but way thinner than my usual towels.</li>
<li> I will probably buy another for a trip - we will be packing very light and not always staying at hotels.</li>
<li> Defenitely great for those who like to travel light and still have a full size towel.</li>
<li> It dries quickly and feels good.  </li>
<li> All the more reason why I love this towel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I wish it came in more colors.</li>
<li> I love this towel.  </li>
<li> but you will soon grow to love it.  </li>
<li> Once most of the water is removed then you can \\&quot;towel down\\&quot;</li>
<li> I had to fined another place where to purchase 22 more bath towels.  </li>
<li> I am going to buy more when my girls are teenagers.  </li>
<li> Aquis towels are the best I&#x27;ve ever used--and the only ones I&#x27;ll use from now on.</li>
<li> If you don&#x27;t mind a somewhat unconventional feel, you will love these towels.</li>
<li> hope to find more diversity of colors</li>
<li> Offer more hues</li>
<li> i love these absorbent and quick-drying towels.</li>
<li> I am 63 and this is simply the best towel I have ever owned.</li>
<li> and i&#x27;m glad</li>
<li> glad i didn&#x27;t purchase the specialized hair towel from aquis.</li>
<li> I love this towel and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
<li> It just works better then</li>
<li> but they can cover some surface area! :)</li>
<li> I loved my towels because they are light weight and easier to fit in my gym bag, they are super absorbant and I can wrap it well around myself!</li>
<li> I am so excited about this towel!</li>
<li> I have used these towels for years and still like them better than my big&lt;br /&gt;thick towels as the Aquis drys my hair and myself very quickly.</li>
<li> I also bought the one designed specifically for hair, but I perfer this one because it is more comfortable and seems to absorb better.</li>
<li> I love the waffle texture over the smooth but have plenty of both styles.  </li>
<li> ... and, at first, I did love it!</li>
<li> It does do a very good job it absorbing water and dries extremely fast.  </li>
<li> Pulls a lot of moisture from the hair and the generous size makes it easy to towel off</li>
<li> Stains don&#x27;t wash out so easily, and the towel will start losing shape with washings.</li>
<li> The bleach does the job though, even when washed in warm water (vs. hot).  </li>
<li> everything was fine.</li>
<li> Dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t stink like many specialty towels you use for&lt;br /&gt;Travel.</li>
<li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s pretty much the best towel purchase I&#x27;ve ever made, but that isn&#x27;t saying much.</li>
<li> so I can get rid of all my huge, bulky, inefficient cotton towels.</li>
<li> so it would fit in my gym bag.</li>
<li> Sales rep confirmed that their microfiber is indeed split.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Love love the absorbency of microfiber, and the lightweight quality of Aquis&#x27; style, size and functionality has happily replaced every heavy cotton bath towel in the house.  </li>
<li> It was good at first but after the first wash the ends started to fray</li>
<li> However, once you get used to using it, you will find it dries you very quickly and dries quickly on the rack.</li>
<li> I have been using this each morning on my hair for about 2 months and have noticed a significant increase in the shine and smoothess of my hair.  </li>
<li> Worth the money!</li>
<li> I experienced being way more dry after hot yoga and a shower than I have been when using cotton towels.  </li>
<li> I was able to wash my hair right after dinner, when it was most convenient, and go to bed with dry hair thanks to this great towel.</li>
<li> I needed a towel which was very light and compact, so I ended up with one from REI, which while not as pretty will fit my needs far better.</li>
<li> am still using my 1st one after several years but wanted another for the summer.&lt;br /&gt;So great to take to the pool or lake because they don&#x27;t take up much room in your bag and are so absorbent!</li>
<li> My favorite thing about this is how fast the towel itself dries after it removes moisture from you.  </li>
<li> I needed a thinner towel to take to the gym and to yoga because I have a gym bag that is SO FULL already.  </li>
<li> Love that this dries so fast.</li>
<li> Most absorbing towel I ever had.</li>
<li> The feel is a bit rubbery but not bad.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not using it in some super humid environment or to accomplish any special task, just for myself after I shower.</li>
<li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)  Saves me minutes by absorbing water from my hair more quickly when it&#x27;s wrapped in the towel.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m pleased with them and think their worth a try but will probably want to have a large cotton towel in my bathroom -</li>
<li> One other great thing is that it dries quickly.</li>
<li> i may receive some flack for this, but i&#x27;m one of those OCD people who has to have a fresh, clean towel after every shower (lots of laundry).</li>
<li> Towel warmers are lost on them since the heat dissipates quickly.</li>
<li> It dries you off really quick</li>
<li> Dries quickly and I&#x27;ve become accustomed to the feel of it.  </li>
<li> This towel is all about drying you off quick</li>
<li> It&#x27;s like no other kind of towel.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s great to get so dry so fast!</li>
<li> Wrapped around me easily to tuck in for getting ready at the gym.  </li>
<li> and I&#x27;ll definitely order more!</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d want them for an everyday towel because of the lack of plushness, but they&#x27;ll be great for travel.</li>
<li> Perhaps more frequent washings would help.  </li>
<li> Worth the price.</li>
<li> These towels are the most absorbent towels I have met, but they are not the soft, plush towels that belonged in a five star hotel.</li>
<li> I completely disagree with &amp;#34;pros and cons&amp;#34; review, because we have enjoyed the beige waffle body towels for 7 years now</li>
<li> I say that for three reasons: 1) It absorbs water faster and more completely, 2)</li>
<li> They are great to travel with too, they take up very little space in the luggage bag.</li>
<li> takes up little space in the linen closet and provides more absorbancy that the best, fluffy towel.  </li>
<li> I just like the feel of a good rub down with a plush towel after a shower.   </li>
<li> The waffle weave aquis towel is the best on the market for wet hair and wet bodies.</li>
<li> It is so gentle on the skin, as it quickly absorbs moisture.</li>
<li> soft, waffle weave feels great on my body and does not &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34; on my wet skin.</li>
<li> Good for compact towel needs during travel or gym, but does not slide well along the skin (kind of grips you), which feels weird.</li>
<li> I wash it in the machine (sometimes gentle sometimes normal cycle, either is fine) with woolite and NO fabric softner.</li>
<li> I will consider it reasonable if they hold up to a year of fun and sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> so it fits in my gym bag with ease, and it dries soooo fast!  </li>
<li> This is my first Microfiber towel.</li>
<li> i had purchased another brand for my trailer, but it was not made as well, and did not keep its shape after the first use.</li>
<li> :) we bought two dozen egyptian cotton towels a couple weeks back</li>
<li> well, i am willing to go two...</li>
<li> It is really soft and comfortable to use and SO absorbent.</li>
<li> This is my first one, but I&#x27;m definitely going to buy a couple more</li>
<li> and i swear they become less soft after each laundry load and more and more lint comes off.</li>
<li> I received it as a gift and liked it so much I purchased for other gifts.</li>
<li> It was a present for my Boss last christmas, and she really liked.it was in good condition, the product satisfice my exoectatives</li>
<li> Getting dry after a shower takes notably longer here</li>
<li> Then the towels themselves dry like magic.</li>
<li> Dries very quickly on the rack and in the drier, so it doesn&#x27;t get that must smell some traditional towels get.</li>
<li> The only downside is that the material is a bit grippy, so it won&#x27;t slide along your skin easily.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a large towel</li>
<li> It was large and luxurious.</li>
<li> It didn&#x27;t last long as my favorite towel, but I still like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light.</li>
<li> Fold very flat and tucks easily</li>
<li> Very absorbent.</li>
<li> she really likes it a lot.</li>
<li> The aquis amicrofiber body towel, waffle white (29x55 inches is fantastic.  </li>
<li> This towel is very absorbent.  </li>
<li> I recommend this towel for the whole family.   </li>
<li> Its lightweight yet very sturdy.  </li>
<li> They do not take up much room in the washer.  </li>
<li> So much nicer than terry cloth.</li>
<li> Performed much better than I expected.</li>
<li> /&gt;i took a shower and had a cotton towel for my hair and the aquis microfiber body towel ready for once the water stopped.</li>
<li> OK, first off, if you&#x27;re looking for a nice fluffy, soft, comfy towel to dry off with, keep looking.  </li>
<li> Work really well, and dry very quickly.  </li>
<li> Even better, it doesn&#x27;t make my curls frizzy the way a couple of other brands of microfiber towels have done, even ones without the waffle weave.</li>
<li> You can air dry or put it in the dryer, either is fine, but no dryer sheets.</li>
<li> Lightweight, not bulky (great for a gym bag), and very thirsty towels are not very costly and last a  long time.</li>
<li> In more typical circumstances, bleaching might not be needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> a quick blowdry only lasts 3 minutes.  </li>
<li> , i have very sensitive skin and my eczema flares up from being in the water too much</li>
<li> But this light little towel, dries better,  used to feel moist still with the cotton towel and hang it up and dry in a hour or so.  </li>
<li> I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> suspect that the high humidity in my home, coupled with washing the towel just twice a week, probably causes the need to add bleach.  </li>
<li> highly recommend.</li>
<li> Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very thin and perfect for camping or just use it like you would a regular bath size towel.</li>
<li> highly recommend.</li>
<li> The waffle weave is far better than the other microweave towels Aquis and others make.</li>
<li> It dries in a flash, and is soft and plenty large to wrap around oneself after a shower.  </li>
<li> They dry you quickly and then seem to dry quickly on the rack, though I haven&#x27;t timed them or anything!</li>
<li> These are so soft and really absorb water well.</li>
<li> Very absorbant, soft, and packs well.  </li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t glide over your skin like a normal towel.  </li>
<li> also, it was dry within an hour or so which is rather astonishing as the cotton towel i had on my head for only two minutes is still damp.&lt;br</li>
<li> I use it at the gym and it is large enough to wrap around a large man.</li>
<li> My daughter uses the towel for her super long hair and loves it.</li>
<li> However, this is easy to adjust to, so it&#x27;s not worth taking a star away.</li>
<li> /&gt;It dries quickly, and I feel dry when I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
<li> so i like that i can dry off quickly with this towel without aggravating my skin.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s the same size as a regular bath towel, but it honestly doesn&#x27;t need to be unless you like to wrap it around yourself for coverage after you dry off.</li>
<li> its great and would be hard to go back to a regular cotton towel now....</li>
<li> With my traditional towels, I have to wash them in hot water with bleach to prevent</li>
<li> 29 x 55 inches is the perfect size for my thick, long hair (halfway down myback).</li>
<li> i realized very quickly that this was unnecessary as i was able to furiously dry myself as i would with a cotton towel!</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t mind that it doesn&#x27;t glide much because it&#x27;s so much faster to get dry with this towel.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m dry right away.</li>
<li> Its very light weight and even wet does not weigh anything like a wet cotton towel.   </li>
<li> With my other towels, I didn&#x27;t realize how many times I had to go over my skin to thoroughly dry</li>
<li> I have an old house with window units for A/C (not efficient at eliminating humidity in the house).  </li>
<li> I continue to get ready until all that is left is my hair.  </li>
<li> It absorbs moisture from short hair so fast you&#x27;ll think you used a hair dryer.  </li>
<li> Many people complained of the dye coming off onto their dogs fur.  </li>
<li> I waws surprised at how absorbant it is</li>
<li> They&#x27;re soft and absorbent and do not shed lint as terry cloth often does.</li>
<li> WOW...</li>
<li> Over time, though, as some reviewers have mentioned, it has developed a greyish hue.</li>
<li> I would convert our whole household to Aquis towels but keep some regular towels around because of the skeptics that visit.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s really make the body totally day</li>
<li> maybe three...showers without washing this towel just because of how soft it is.</li>
<li> it was worth the money spent.</li>
<li> It is small and compact and easy to travel with.</li>
<li> Pretty much one pat on any part of your skin is enough to dry it!</li>
<li> After a couple of hours it&#x27;s ready to dry you off again like new.</li>
<li> , the only difference is it&#x27;s labeled as a \\&quot;Pet Towel\\&quot; but is exactly the same size and material.   </li>
<li> loved this towel so much that I bought the same one for my 20-year-old niece who has long, thick hair that takes forever to dry.  </li>
<li> Even better, and the main reason why I purchased these, is because they are light-weight and take up less space in the washer, as a result I do less loads of laundry, saves time, water and energy!</li>
<li> I like these because they dry faster, don&#x27;t take up much space, et.</li>
<li> and it was almost dry by the time I was ready to leave.  </li>
<li> Very absorbent, and big enough to wrap my hair up turban style.</li>
<li> You&#x27;re not going to wipe it across your skin like a cotton towel, you pretty much have to blot the water off your skin - it will stick and drag across wet skin.  </li>
<li> This towel is softer and more absorbent than cotton, even though it is less than half the thickness and weight of the cotton towels I used to use.</li>
<li> By this time, my hair is just barely damp and</li>
<li> More unnecessary chemicals for our furry friends.</li>
<li> I use the same towel both times, and it&#x27;s perfectly dry when I&#x27;m ready to use it.</li>
<li> The care instructions say you shouldn&#x27;t bleach the towel, and for a while I didn&#x27;t, but after a few weeks I found I needed to add a couple of teaspoons of bleach to the wash or it doesn&#x27;t smell quite right.  </li>
<li> Aquis dry quickly and are soft and fluffy when hung out to dry--eliminating need to go in the dryer.</li>
<li> The pulling feeling other reviewers have mentioned doesn&#x27;t bother me much, but it&#x27;s there.</li>
<li> The washing instructions say to not dry them with fabric softener.</li>
<li> my hair takes over 24 hours to dry (or 3 hours with a blow dryer or 90 minutes at a professional salon).</li>
<li> When folded, even the large towel consumes little spaceon a shelf or in a suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Also, my Aquis was a real life-saver on a late summer road trip in New England.</li>
<li> The towel does not slide across wet skin pulling water with it so a new technique of patting must be learned, which can be tricky when drying one&#x27;s back.</li>
<li> They are so much thinner and lightweight than regular towels - they take up less space in the washer.  </li>
<li> I used to dry my traditional towels for 45-60 minutes on high to thoroughly dry</li>
<li> live in an extremely humid environment on the Gulf Coast.  </li>
<li> If you have never used a microfiber towel before it will be a little strange at first</li>
<li> But I am not happy about the fact that it gets old after first wash.</li>
<li> However, once the drying technique is learned you may never go back to traditional cotton towels since these towels dry the body qui</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re someone who occasionally takes multiple showers a day, you know that you might have to use multiple towels because they take so long to dry out after use.  </li>
<li> They last a long time.  </li>
<li> Next, I blow dry my hair.  </li>
<li> and It&#x27;s so dry two people could use the same towel and wouldn&#x27;t be a problem.  </li>
<li> Bought this because regular towels don&#x27;t dry well on our boat.  </li>
<li> If, like me, you put on a robe after you dry off, the smaller &#x27;hair towel&#x27; size should be sufficient</li>
<li> Towel is super thin.  </li>
<li> They are thin, quick drying and rather ruff.</li>
<li> It is also super thin</li>
<li> It dries fine, but its uncomfortable to use.  </li>
<li> At first they do feel a little strange; as others have said, they stick a little as you slide them over your skin.</li>
<li> The waffle texture feels a little &amp;#34;fluffier&amp;#34; and soft to the touch.  </li>
<li> /&gt;i was seriously hesitant to buy the aquis microfiber body towel after reading some of the negative reviews- mostly about how the towel didn&#x27;t slide well over the skin and whatnot.</li>
<li> I have long hair and Aquis towels are so absorbent they are kinder to my hair and lighter than cotton towels.  </li>
<li> just pat dry.</li>
<li> and of course they dry out.  </li>
<li> but it doesn&#x27;t completely dry your hair.</li>
<li> I purchased this towel to dry my hair.</li>
<li> and I was instantly dry.  </li>
<li> These towels dry rapidly.</li>
<li> The moment the towel is positioned around the body after showering, you are instantly dry.  </li>
<li> I have one of the regular weave Aquis towels, but prefer the waffle weave hands down.</li>
<li> I have thick, curly hair down to my waist and this Aquis towel not only holds it all gently, it also cuts down my drying time by three hours.</li>
<li> They work just as well as a regular towel but take up much less space and weight.</li>
<li> I will not go back to conventional bath towels ever!</li>
<li> This is a little different than I imagined it would be.  </li>
<li> I have these thick white cotton towels I usually use,  you know the normal bathroom towels.  </li>
<li> When I am done using them they feel so wet and damp</li>
<li> I bought this for my aged mother.</li>
<li> What a total waste of money.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s compact and minimal.</li>
<li> The material is really thin, too, so it won&#x27;t take up much room if you&#x27;re packing it.</li>
<li> That being said, it wasn&#x27;t quite what I expected.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not tiny either, not huge..</li>
<li> My hairstylist cautioned me not to leave my hair wrapped in the towel for too long as it might dry unevenly and cause frizzing, but it hasn&#x27;t posed any problem for me.  </li>
<li> I have extremely dry, thick, coarse, low-porosity, 3-c</li>
<li> This may be due to the fact that I wash the towel just a couple of times a week, but I use it every day.</li>
<li> I now prefer microfiber towels to any other type.</li>
<li> I ordered this due to the reviews that already exist for it.  </li>
<li> My other cotton towels would take forever.</li>
<li> &quot; my face as other people had said they did.</li>
<li> any other towel I&#x27;ve ever used-</li>
<li> I returned this product because I had not expected a microfiber towel to be so thick and bulky.  </li>
<li> I wash my hair at night and then wet it down to style it in the morning.</li>
<li> Some guests think they feel rough, but they are trying to rub themselves down.  </li>
<li> It folds up really small and would save a typical family with several sets of towels a TON of space in the linen closet.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not as thick as traditional towels, but feels thicker than some other microfiber towels we&#x27;ve used.</li>
<li> I needed a towel thinner than your average bath towel</li>
<li> They take up less than half the space of our other towels in the gym bags, and drying off goes a bit faster -</li>
<li> Bought them for wiping dog down after playing in the surf and sand.  </li>
<li> But I used it to pat my body down</li>
<li> and by furiously, i mean i definitely get some exfoliation</li>
<li> I use the towel to pat dry my (long, thick) hair &amp; don&#x27;t bother with the blow dryer anymore!</li>
<li> It takes less blow drying time than it used to.  </li>
<li> less cost).  </li>
<li> I have had less breakage with this reduction in exposure to heat (blowdryer).</li>
<li> It also takes up much less space.</li>
<li> Why would I want to subject her to dye when she does&#x27;t have any color preferences.  </li>
<li> Cuts my drying time in half</li>
<li> It dries quicker and is lighter for laundering (less energy), and 3) it freaking rocks.</li>
<li> A little pricey, but I like it,  and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my washing machine when I go to wash towels.  </li>
<li> The fabric is thin, so it makes it a bit strange to dry yourself off.&lt;br</li>
<li> (I have long, thick hair).</li>
<li> i&#x27;m completely dry in less than a minute and the towel is hardly damp.</li>
<li> My hair is still a little damp, but it goes from wet to damn a lot quicker than the ordinary towels.</li>
<li> I usually wrap my hair in the towel for about 5 minutes after a shower (and after drying my skin with it), and then I unwrap the towel to apply my usual mousse and other wet hair products and comb through.  </li>
<li> It does glide a little, I find.  </li>
<li> Not this little marvel.  </li>
<li> I could get drier using a thin worn out regular towel, than I did with this towel.  </li>
<li> I prefer it over heavy cotton towels.  </li>
<li> I had trouble with my towels smelling musty with my front loader.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ll admit that it doesn&#x27;t glide like a traditional towel, but it&#x27;s not as awkward as I expected based on the reviews.  </li>
<li> Not sure.  </li>
<li> yourself rather than the usual way.  </li>
<li> especially considering how expensive it</li>
<li> This microfiber towel was completely worthless as far as getting you dry.  </li>
<li> It took this towel, another small worthless micro fiber towel and a regular terry cloth towel to get my hair and myself dry after taking a shower</li>
<li> This means that it&#x27;s always hard to keep anything feeling truly \\&quot;dry\\&quot; in the house, and mildew is an ongoing battle.  </li>
<li> It clings to your skin and is hard to move around.  </li>
<li> I do add a little white vinegar to the rinse water, but I do this for everything I wash (it doesn&#x27;t smell bad afterwards,</li>
<li> I guess I just prefer a thick cotton towel, I dont even use this thing anymore.</li>
<li> but it will pack in a very small space.</li>
<li> But I am disappointed that the limit was only up to 3 items.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s thin, but seems to absorb a lot of water.</li>
<li> I wish I could get my money back for the worthless thing.</li>
<li> I do have to add just a little bleach to the wash when I wash the towel to prevent unpleasant \\&quot;musty\\&quot; smells.  </li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t feel weird.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m certainly sorry I believed the people who said this.  </li>
<li> I was actually skeptical whether this towel was made from split microfiber as it doesn&#x27;t catch my skin imperfections.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s also very thin, not plush.  </li>
<li> - this was a disappointment.</li>
<li> Expansive for a body towel Fairly disappointed.</li>
<li> - I&#x27;m disappointed in that, for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this towel through Amazon about 2 months ago.  I&#x27;ve used it every day since then.  Bottom line:  it does what it says it does.  I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in an extremely humid environment on the Gulf Coast.  I have an old house with window units for A/C (not efficient at eliminating humidity in the house).  My home is exceptionally humid as compared to most homes in the U.S.  This means that it&#x27;s always hard to keep anything feeling truly \\&quot;dry\\&quot; in the house, and mildew is an ongoing battle.  Getting dry after a shower takes notably longer here than it does when I travel elsewhere.  All the more reason why I love this towel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  Saves me minutes during my morning routine because the towel dries my skin with just one pass.  With my other towels, I didn&#x27;t realize how many times I had to go over my skin to thoroughly dry it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)  Saves me minutes by absorbing water from my hair more quickly when it&#x27;s wrapped in the towel.  My hairstylist cautioned me not to leave my hair wrapped in the towel for too long as it might dry unevenly and cause frizzing, but it hasn&#x27;t posed any problem for me.  I usually wrap my hair in the towel for about 5 minutes after a shower (and after drying my skin with it), and then I unwrap the towel to apply my usual mousse and other wet hair products and comb through.  Afterwards, I wrap my hair in the towel again and let it absorb for another 5 minutes or so while I do my make up.  Next, I blow dry my hair.  It takes less blow drying time than it used to.  No problems.  No hair damage.  Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)  Towel dries faster on the rack between uses (compared to a traditional bath towel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4)  Towel dries fast in the dryer, too, and can easily be dried on low to medium heat in about 10-12 minutes.  I used to dry my traditional towels for 45-60 minutes on high to thoroughly dry them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5)  Towel is super thin.  When folded, even the large towel consumes little spaceon a shelf or in a suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6)  Product instructions say not to add fabric softener (I like this...less cost).  I do not add a commercial softener (e.g., Downy), and I haven&#x27;t missed it.  I do add a little white vinegar to the rinse water, but I do this for everything I wash (it doesn&#x27;t smell bad afterwards, BTW).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON (just one):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  I do have to add just a little bleach to the wash when I wash the towel to prevent unpleasant \\&quot;musty\\&quot; smells.  The care instructions say you shouldn&#x27;t bleach the towel, and for a while I didn&#x27;t, but after a few weeks I found I needed to add a couple of teaspoons of bleach to the wash or it doesn&#x27;t smell quite right.  This may be due to the fact that I wash the towel just a couple of times a week, but I use it every day. Perhaps more frequent washings would help.  Not sure.  The bleach does the job though, even when washed in warm water (vs. hot).  With my traditional towels, I have to wash them in hot water with bleach to prevent smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect that the high humidity in my home, coupled with washing the towel just twice a week, probably causes the need to add bleach.  In more typical circumstances, bleaching might not be needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed some reviewers said they don&#x27;t like the feel of the towel because it doesn&#x27;t glide against their skin.  I&#x27;ll admit that it doesn&#x27;t glide like a traditional towel, but it&#x27;s not as awkward as I expected based on the reviews.  It does glide a little, I find.  I don&#x27;t mind that it doesn&#x27;t glide much because it&#x27;s so much faster to get dry with this towel. I&#x27;d rather have the efficiency than the \\&quot;glide\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved this towel so much that I bought the same one for my 20-year-old niece who has long, thick hair that takes forever to dry.  She loves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Although it is absorbent, if there is any roughness to your skin, it the material &amp;#34;catches&amp;#34; on each spot. I bought 3 for a gift and ended up keeping them because it didn&#x27;t rise to the quality of a &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34; in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I love microfiber towels! These are so soft and really absorb water well. I will never go back to using regular towels again!</li>
    <li> These are nice bath towels. I have them in white. The washing instructions say to not dry them with fabric softener.</li>
    <li> I have thick, curly hair down to my waist and this Aquis towel not only holds it all gently, it also cuts down my drying time by three hours. Even better, it doesn&#x27;t make my curls frizzy the way a couple of other brands of microfiber towels have done, even ones without the waffle weave. Also, my Aquis was a real life-saver on a late summer road trip in New England. I was able to wash my hair right after dinner, when it was most convenient, and go to bed with dry hair thanks to this great towel.</li>
    <li> Love it! Best towel forever.</li>
    <li> I ordered these to reduce my laundry.  They are so much thinner and lightweight than regular towels - they take up less space in the washer.  This is a great benefit.  The greatest benefit of all though, is the improvement in the health of my hair that I have experienced.  I have been using this each morning on my hair for about 2 months and have noticed a significant increase in the shine and smoothess of my hair.  I wrap it up each morning as soon as I get out of the shower and after I comb my hair.  I continue to get ready until all that is left is my hair.  By this time, my hair is just barely damp and a quick blowdry only lasts 3 minutes.  I have had less breakage with this reduction in exposure to heat (blowdryer). My hair looks the best that it has in years. I&#x27;m thrilled! I also bought the one designed specifically for hair, but I perfer this one because it is more comfortable and seems to absorb better.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 of these towels for my husband and I to take to the gym. They take up less than half the space of our other towels in the gym bags, and drying off goes a bit faster - just pat dry. I use the towel to pat dry my (long, thick) hair &amp; don&#x27;t bother with the blow dryer anymore! Worth the price.</li>
    <li> These are the best micro fiber towels on the market and they are great to pack and take with you on a trip.  Aquis has great quality and look.</li>
    <li> I have these thick white cotton towels I usually use,  you know the normal bathroom towels.  When I am done using them they feel so wet and damp and of course they dry out.  But this light little towel, dries better,  used to feel moist still with the cotton towel and hang it up and dry in a hour or so.  and It&#x27;s so dry two people could use the same towel and wouldn&#x27;t be a problem.  A little pricey, but I like it,  and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my washing machine when I go to wash towels.  Think I&#x27;ll get another and one for a friend</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a large towel but it will pack in a very small space. I use it at the gym and it is large enough to wrap around a large man. Dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t stink like many specialty towels you use for&lt;br /&gt;Travel. Very absorbent. Doesn&#x27;t feel weird. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my aged mother. She loved it. It was a perfect gift. It was large and luxurious. She feels pampered.</li>
    <li> This towel is great! It is absorbent, lightweight and big enough to wrap up my waist length hair.</li>
    <li> These towels are the most absorbent towels I have met, but they are not the soft, plush towels that belonged in a five star hotel. They are thin, quick drying and rather ruff. Towel warmers are lost on them since the heat dissipates quickly. The towel does not slide across wet skin pulling water with it so a new technique of patting must be learned, which can be tricky when drying one&#x27;s back. However, once the drying technique is learned you may never go back to traditional cotton towels since these towels dry the body qui</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t absorb water as well as a regular terry cloth towel does. Expansive for a body towel Fairly disappointed. It has been sitting in my linen closet for years now.</li>
    <li> I returned this product because I had not expected a microfiber towel to be so thick and bulky.  I needed a towel which was very light and compact, so I ended up with one from REI, which while not as pretty will fit my needs far better.</li>
    <li> got it for wifey. she really likes it a lot. it&#x27;s thin, but seems to absorb a lot of water. i used it once and it works.     My hair is still a little damp, but it goes from wet to damn a lot quicker than the ordinary towels.</li>
    <li> The aquis amicrofiber body towel, waffle white (29x55 inches is fantastic.  This towel is very absorbent.  The best towel I have ever bought.  I recommend this towel for the whole family.   It dries you off really quick and now I am going to buy the Aquis in a hair wrap.  I already have one made of terry cloth but it doesn&#x27;t completely dry your hair.</li>
    <li> It was good at first but after the first wash the ends started to fray</li>
    <li> This was just what I was looking for. It is a good size and material but absorbs and dries well too. I will probably buy another for a trip - we will be packing very light and not always staying at hotels. While its  a great choice for those kinds of travels, I&#x27;m using it at home too and it is perfect - just as warm but way thinner than my usual towels.</li>
    <li> You have to get used to the feel of a microfiber towel because it is unlike a cotton towel. However, once you get used to using it, you will find it dries you very quickly and dries quickly on the rack. It also takes up much less space. I now prefer microfiber towels to any other type.</li>
    <li> I had read how nice microfiber towels were.  I&#x27;m certainly sorry I believed the people who said this.  What a total waste of money.  It took this towel, another small worthless micro fiber towel and a regular terry cloth towel to get my hair and myself dry after taking a shower and I have short hair.  This microfiber towel was completely worthless as far as getting you dry.  I could get drier using a thin worn out regular towel, than I did with this towel.  I wish I could get my money back for the worthless thing.</li>
    <li> I like these because they dry faster, don&#x27;t take up much space, et.</li>
    <li> This towel is like nothing you have ever used.....its great and would be hard to go back to a regular cotton towel now....</li>
    <li> The waffle weave aquis towel is the best on the market for wet hair and wet bodies. It absorbs moisture from short hair so fast you&#x27;ll think you used a hair dryer.  My daughter uses the towel for her super long hair and loves it. This super size towel is great for after shower and hair or take it to the gym. It is small and compact and easy to travel with. The waffle weave is far better than the other microweave towels Aquis and others make. I do not like the plush looking microfiber ones....they don&#x27;t perform the same way. Be sure to get the waffle weave, and of course, Amazon has the best prices.</li>
    <li> I needed a towel thinner than your average bath towel so it would fit in my gym bag. The fact that it dries quick is an excellent added bonus.</li>
    <li> Dries quickly and I&#x27;ve become accustomed to the feel of it.  Especially great to take on the boat when I sail.</li>
    <li> This towel is softer and more absorbent than cotton, even though it is less than half the thickness and weight of the cotton towels I used to use. It is so gentle on the skin, as it quickly absorbs moisture. Also great for hair. I have one of the regular weave Aquis towels, but prefer the waffle weave hands down. I wish it came in more colors.</li>
    <li> I love this towel.  It doesn&#x27;t leave lint.  Its lightweight yet very sturdy.  Its the perfect size.  It dries quickly and feels good.  If you have never used a microfiber towel before it will be a little strange at first but you will soon grow to love it.  I will not go back to conventional bath towels ever!</li>
    <li> This is a little different than I imagined it would be.  You&#x27;re not going to wipe it across your skin like a cotton towel, you pretty much have to blot the water off your skin - it will stick and drag across wet skin.  Once most of the water is removed then you can \\&quot;towel down\\&quot; like you&#x27;re probably used to.  It does do a very good job it absorbing water and dries extremely fast.  Its very light weight and even wet does not weigh anything like a wet cotton towel.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It makes a very good sports towel and I&#x27;ll probably be taking one with me now when I travel after experiencing the \\&quot;sandpaper\\&quot; towels some motels have.  I also purchased the pet towel to have a different color, the only difference is it&#x27;s labeled as a \\&quot;Pet Towel\\&quot; but is exactly the same size and material.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m pleased with them and think their worth a try but will probably want to have a large cotton towel in my bathroom - I just like the feel of a good rub down with a plush towel after a shower.   &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Bought this because regular towels don&#x27;t dry well on our boat.  These towels are different, you \\&quot;pat\\&quot; yourself rather than the usual way.  Work really well, and dry very quickly.  Wish they came in more colors, so I dyed mine - perfect!</li>
    <li> I guess I just prefer a thick cotton towel, I dont even use this thing anymore. I&#x27;ll just use it as a gym towel.</li>
    <li> This is my second Aquis Microfiber Body Towel.&lt;br /&gt;I am still using my 1st one after several years but wanted another for the summer.&lt;br /&gt;So great to take to the pool or lake because they don&#x27;t take up much room in your bag and are so absorbent!</li>
    <li> I started with the hair towel and then added this size.  I prefer it over heavy cotton towels.  I like the waffle style.</li>
    <li> It was a present for my Boss last christmas, and she really liked.it was in good condition, the product satisfice my exoectatives</li>
    <li> I purchased this towel to dry my hair. Towel-drying with a regular towel and air-drying my hair takes over 24 hours to dry (or 3 hours with a blow dryer or 90 minutes at a professional salon). With this towel, my hair air-dried in about 2-3 hours. I have extremely dry, thick, coarse, low-porosity, 3-c hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soft, waffle weave feels great on my body and does not &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34; on my wet skin. I was actually skeptical whether this towel was made from split microfiber as it doesn&#x27;t catch my skin imperfections. Sales rep confirmed that their microfiber is indeed split.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This towel looks and feels great! Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Split microfiber&lt;br /&gt;80% polyester / 20% nylon polyamide&lt;br /&gt;Waffle weave&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight, compact&lt;br /&gt;Made in Korea&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am checking on the GSM and will report back.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these towels about 7 years ago and it was getting to be the point I needed to replace it.  I googled the name on the ID tag and found it at Amazon.com.  I am as happy as a pig in his favorite mud bath.  These are wonderful towels.  I gave one as a gift to intro them to her house.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my purchase.   But I am disappointed that the limit was only up to 3 items.  I had to fined another place where to purchase 22 more bath towels.  I wanted them for Christmas gifts.</li>
    <li> These towels are great.  I had trouble with my towels smelling musty with my front loader.  Not these.  They never smell.  We hang them on a hook and don&#x27;t have to wash them for 2 weeks.  I am going to buy more when my girls are teenagers.  They do not take up much room in the washer.  They last a long time.  I have had mine for almost two years and they have not frayed.</li>
    <li> Bought them for wiping dog down after playing in the surf and sand.  Seemed to work well for this.  Pulls a lot of moisture from the hair and the generous size makes it easy to towel off fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star off for the price.  I will consider it reasonable if they hold up to a year of fun and sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are not being sold as dog towels but they do market a red version for such.  Many people complained of the dye coming off onto their dogs fur.  Yuck.  Why would I want to subject her to dye when she does&#x27;t have any color preferences.  More unnecessary chemicals for our furry friends.</li>
    <li> OK, first off, if you&#x27;re looking for a nice fluffy, soft, comfy towel to dry off with, keep looking.  This towel is all about drying you off quick so you can get on with your day, and it works great!  My favorite thing about this is how fast the towel itself dries after it removes moisture from you.  If you&#x27;re someone who occasionally takes multiple showers a day, you know that you might have to use multiple towels because they take so long to dry out after use.  Not this little marvel.  After a couple of hours it&#x27;s ready to dry you off again like new.</li>
    <li> I needed a thinner towel to take to the gym and to yoga because I have a gym bag that is SO FULL already.  I ordered this due to the reviews that already exist for it.  It does not disappoint!  I waws surprised at how absorbant it is and it&#x27;s actually really good sized.  Wrapped around me easily to tuck in for getting ready at the gym.  I experienced being way more dry after hot yoga and a shower than I have been when using cotton towels.  It is also super thin so it fits in my gym bag with ease, and it dries soooo fast!  I hung it up after my shower on the locker and it was almost dry by the time I was ready to leave.  I know there are reviews that say that it pulls your skin...let me explain...it doesn&#x27;t necessarily &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; in my opinion...it just doesn&#x27;t glide like a cotton towel does.  But I used it to pat my body down and I was instantly dry.  I am so excited about this towel!</li>
    <li> Aquis towels are the best I&#x27;ve ever used--and the only ones I&#x27;ll use from now on. At first they do feel a little strange; as others have said, they stick a little as you slide them over your skin. But they are so absorbent! It&#x27;s great to get so dry so fast! Then the towels themselves dry like magic. I wash my hair at night and then wet it down to style it in the morning. I use the same towel both times, and it&#x27;s perfectly dry when I&#x27;m ready to use it. If you don&#x27;t mind a somewhat unconventional feel, you will love these towels.</li>
    <li> Love these towels! So much nicer than terry cloth. They&#x27;re soft and absorbent and do not shed lint as terry cloth often does. Even better, and the main reason why I purchased these, is because they are light-weight and take up less space in the washer, as a result I do less loads of laundry, saves time, water and energy! They are great to travel with too, they take up very little space in the luggage bag. They seem to hold up well over time, I&#x27;ve been using and washing them regularly since I purchased them 9 months ago and they are still in very good condition. Definitely a product I will purchase again when the time comes.</li>
    <li> I completely disagree with &amp;#34;pros and cons&amp;#34; review, because we have enjoyed the beige waffle body towels for 7 years now and they don&#x27;t show signs of requiring replacements.  Love love the absorbency of microfiber, and the lightweight quality of Aquis&#x27; style, size and functionality has happily replaced every heavy cotton bath towel in the house.  Aquis dry quickly and are soft and fluffy when hung out to dry--eliminating need to go in the dryer.</li>
    <li> Love that this dries so fast. My other cotton towels would take forever.</li>
    <li> We are people who spend a good amount of time in motorhome and on our boat. These towels dry rapidly. We are very pleased with our purchase.</li>
    <li> I have long hair and Aquis towels are so absorbent they are kinder to my hair and lighter than cotton towels.  I chose the bath size this time because my hair has gotten longer than the hair towel.  Great product</li>
    <li> We bought these towels for a trip we haven&#x27;t taken yet, but my kids and I have used them at home as a trial. They work just as well as a regular towel but take up much less space and weight. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d want them for an everyday towel because of the lack of plushness, but they&#x27;ll be great for travel. The feel is a bit rubbery but not bad. They dry you quickly and then seem to dry quickly on the rack, though I haven&#x27;t timed them or anything! If you&#x27;re looking for a lightweight, quick-drying travel towel, I think you&#x27;d be happy with this towel. Mine arrived in disposable plastic zip pouches; I will keep those to pack the towels in for the trip.</li>
    <li> Lightweight and suitable for trips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent raw&lt;br /&gt;Repent not buy never give it five stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very Excellent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to find more diversity of colors</li>
    <li> Performed much better than I expected. Very absorbent, and big enough to wrap my hair up turban style. This will be a permanent addition to my travel bag.</li>
    <li> Well, the reviews made it seem dreamy, but it&#x27;s not quite there for me. The fabric is thin, so it makes it a bit strange to dry yourself off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s a cream color, and not white at all - I&#x27;m disappointed in that, for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll go back to plushy cotton towels - this was a disappointment.</li>
    <li> It dries fine, but its uncomfortable to use.  It doesn&#x27;t glide over your skin like a normal towel.  It clings to your skin and is hard to move around.  It&#x27;s also very thin, not plush.  I&#x27;ll find another.</li>
    <li> I like carry this towel for outside shower after exercise.  It&#x27;s compact and minimal. But I am not happy about the fact that it gets old after first wash.</li>
    <li> I have used these towels for years and still like them better than my big&lt;br /&gt;thick towels as the Aquis drys my hair and myself very quickly.</li>
    <li> This is my first Microfiber towel. After reading the description I decided to order the most expensive towel I ever purchased. Four days later, I recieved it. Tried it out the same day and...WOW...it was worth the money spent. All the description about this towel above is correct. Weights nothing compares to a regular towel. Cuts my drying time in half (I have long, thick hair). Defenitely great for those who like to travel light and still have a full size towel. But why four stars? Lack of colors to choose from. Offer more hues and I&#x27;ll definitely order more!</li>
    <li> The Aquis microfiber towel has a superior wicking feature.  The moment the towel is positioned around the body after showering, you are instantly dry.  takes up little space in the linen closet and provides more absorbancy that the best, fluffy towel.  I received it as a gift and liked it so much I purchased for other gifts.</li>
    <li> Lightweight, not bulky (great for a gym bag), and very thirsty towels are not very costly and last a  long time.</li>
    <li> Good for compact towel needs during travel or gym, but does not slide well along the skin (kind of grips you), which feels weird. Stains don&#x27;t wash out so easily, and the towel will start losing shape with washings.</li>
    <li> i love these absorbent and quick-drying towels. i had purchased another brand for my trailer, but it was not made as well, and did not keep its shape after the first use.</li>
    <li> Truly elegant towel, but also great for the gym or camping trips.  It dries in a flash, and is soft and plenty large to wrap around oneself after a shower.  After using this product I wonder why I would want to use/wash/store bulky towels ever again! I purchased two of these amazing towels.  I likely will purchase at Keats one for each family member.</li>
    <li> This is the best microfiber towel we&#x27;ve ordered. It&#x27;s not as thick as traditional towels, but feels thicker than some other microfiber towels we&#x27;ve used. Dries very quickly on the rack and in the drier, so it doesn&#x27;t get that must smell some traditional towels get. Very satisfied with this one.</li>
    <li> I am 63 and this is simply the best towel I have ever owned. I say that for three reasons: 1) It absorbs water faster and more completely, 2) It dries quicker and is lighter for laundering (less energy), and 3) it freaking rocks.</li>
    <li> This towel picks up water better than any material I&#x27;ve ever used! Pretty much one pat on any part of your skin is enough to dry it! The material is really thin, too, so it won&#x27;t take up much room if you&#x27;re packing it. The only downside is that the material is a bit grippy, so it won&#x27;t slide along your skin easily. However, this is easy to adjust to, so it&#x27;s not worth taking a star away.</li>
    <li> ... and, at first, I did love it! Over time, though, as some reviewers have mentioned, it has developed a greyish hue. It didn&#x27;t last long as my favorite towel, but I still like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light. You&#x27;d probably save money on laundry if these were all you had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dries quickly, and I feel dry when I&#x27;ve used it. The pulling feeling other reviewers have mentioned doesn&#x27;t bother me much, but it&#x27;s there.</li>
    <li> Most absorbing towel I ever had.</li>
    <li> This towel is amazing. It absorbs water like a sponge. It&#x27;s like no other kind of towel. It&#x27;s very thin and perfect for camping or just use it like you would a regular bath size towel. I use it as a regular bath towel. One other great thing is that it dries quickly.</li>
    <li> Been using Aquis towels for almost 20 years now.  Very absorbant, soft, and packs well.  Fold very flat and tucks easily so I like to use it as a body or hair wrap.  I love the waffle texture over the smooth but have plenty of both styles.  The waffle texture feels a little &amp;#34;fluffier&amp;#34; and soft to the touch.  Some guests think they feel rough, but they are trying to rub themselves down.  These towels are so absorbant you can just blot your skin/hair and it dries you so well.  I would convert our whole household to Aquis towels but keep some regular towels around because of the skeptics that visit.</li>
    <li> Perfect! It&#x27;s really make the body totally day</li>
    <li> i happen to be someone who hates damp/slightly damp skin after getting out of the shower. as soon as i turn the water off, i&#x27;m wrapping my hair in a towel and furiously drying myself with another one. and by furiously, i mean i definitely get some exfoliation going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i was seriously hesitant to buy the aquis microfiber body towel after reading some of the negative reviews- mostly about how the towel didn&#x27;t slide well over the skin and whatnot. i took my chances on this towel and i&#x27;m glad i did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as soon as i got this towel, i threw it in the washer w/ my white cotton towels. everything was fine. i then put the aquis microfiber body towel in the dryer by itself and i&#x27;m pleased to say that no lint came off of it! :) we bought two dozen egyptian cotton towels a couple weeks back and i swear they become less soft after each laundry load and more and more lint comes off. it&#x27;s nice to know that this towel will not lose it&#x27;s softness over time- especially considering how expensive it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i took a shower and had a cotton towel for my hair and the aquis microfiber body towel ready for once the water stopped. i wrapped my hair then picked up the microfiber towel and began \\&quot;dabbing\\&quot; my face as other people had said they did. i realized very quickly that this was unnecessary as i was able to furiously dry myself as i would with a cotton towel! no sticky feeling, no rubbing or dragging...maybe i have a great technique or something?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyways, i have very sensitive skin and my eczema flares up from being in the water too much so i like that i can dry off quickly with this towel without aggravating my skin. i&#x27;m completely dry in less than a minute and the towel is hardly damp. i ended up taking the cotton towel off of my head and replacing it with the aquis microfiber body towel. perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m glad i didn&#x27;t purchase the specialized hair towel from aquis. 29 x 55 inches is the perfect size for my thick, long hair (halfway down myback). i will be purchasing another one of these towels so i&#x27;ll have one for my body and one for my hair. i&#x27;ll probably keep purchasing too until i build up a stockpile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also- i remember a while back i was reading some discussion boards and people were debating about how often they wash their towels. i may receive some flack for this, but i&#x27;m one of those OCD people who has to have a fresh, clean towel after every shower (lots of laundry). well, i am willing to go two...maybe three...showers without washing this towel just because of how soft it is. also, it was dry within an hour or so which is rather astonishing as the cotton towel i had on my head for only two minutes is still damp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;like i said, i need to build up a stockpile of these! highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this towel and would recommend it to anyone. It is really soft and comfortable to use and SO absorbent. I&#x27;m not using it in some super humid environment or to accomplish any special task, just for myself after I shower. It just works better then any other towel I&#x27;ve ever used- I&#x27;m dry right away. It&#x27;s the same size as a regular bath towel, but it honestly doesn&#x27;t need to be unless you like to wrap it around yourself for coverage after you dry off. If, like me, you put on a robe after you dry off, the smaller &#x27;hair towel&#x27; size should be sufficient (although I haven&#x27;t yet tried it, I plan on purchasing the smaller size in the future). This is my first one, but I&#x27;m definitely going to buy a couple more so I can get rid of all my huge, bulky, inefficient cotton towels. It folds up really small and would save a typical family with several sets of towels a TON of space in the linen closet. I&#x27;ve had an aquis hair turban in the same material for over a year, so I know this material lasts. I wash it in the machine (sometimes gentle sometimes normal cycle, either is fine) with woolite and NO fabric softner. You can air dry or put it in the dryer, either is fine, but no dryer sheets. Worth the money!</li>
    <li> I loved my towels because they are light weight and easier to fit in my gym bag, they are super absorbant and I can wrap it well around myself! I&#x27;m not tiny either, not huge.. but they can cover some surface area! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s pretty much the best towel purchase I&#x27;ve ever made, but that isn&#x27;t saying much. That being said, it wasn&#x27;t quite what I expected. It doesn&#x27;t have the total convenience of a chamois towel in bath towel form, which is what I was hoping for.</li>
