      <li>Pretty good, serves its purpose, affordable good for day to day usage.</li>
      <li>It heats fast at all temps great curl size, nice silicone sleeve if you have to use it then pack and run.  </li>
      <li>It heats up quickly and does a good job.</li>
      <li>Plus I love the silicone heat shield.</li>
      <li>The wife doesn&#x27;t use it that much but says that it&#x27;s a great item, one of her favorites.</li>
      <li>I had this iron about a year ago and it worked okay for awhile</li>
      <li>I had not used a curling iron in many years.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t see why anyone should ever spend more.</li>
      <li>I think I love this curling iron.</li>
      <li>Would not stay on for more than 5 seconds.  </li>
      <li>Going with Conair hopefully I have better</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t been told if it&#x27;s bad/good or ok yet.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is perfect for ease of use and multiple heat settings.  </li>
      <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m able to use it in both countries without a problem.  </li>
      <li>It makes curling my hair more of a task than it should be.</li>
      <li>Love the ceramic irons.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the heat resistant cover and auto off features.</li>
      <li>I have been using this model and its predecessor for many years.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>The price is good, I feel that the product is great, we&#x27;ll just have to see how long it lasts.</li>
      <li>The highly recommend, great value unsurpassed</li>
      <li>A good, simple curling iron- ceramic is awesome, the multiple heat settings are a nice bonus.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s every I expected heats up great!!!!!</li>
      <li>It heats up quickly, gives me great curls that last all day and was an exceptional value.</li>
      <li>so need it to put my hair in place, kind of straigten and curl the right way,  </li>
      <li>I bought one last year to my sisters and we really loved it!</li>
      <li>and it works very quickly.</li>
      <li>It has large ceramic plates, 25 heat settings, and I absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>(95W Conair vs 80W Revlon) which means it takes less time for me to get a curl :D</li>
      <li>However, after you learn to cope with them, it is fine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, easy to use, have had no issues with pushing buttons etc.</li>
      <li>More money but SO WOrth it.</li>
      <li>This iron surprised me, in a good way.</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;curls\\&quot; which were more like waves fell right out.</li>
      <li>The price alone made it worth the risk!</li>
      <li>I wanted one more exactly</li>
      <li>it was more then what i expected thank you for the good services</li>
      <li>When I turned it on I was pleased with how fast if heated up.</li>
      <li>I cool</li>
      <li>This is my first curling iron, easy to use</li>
      <li>The pros are that it has even heating, the swivel cord, and it heats quickly.</li>
      <li>I think the only drawback is that the buttons do sound kind of plasticky when you press on them</li>
      <li>Heats evenly and super quick.  </li>
      <li>Heats quickly when it does shut off so no worries on that front.</li>
      <li>If her curling iron breaks, I will gladly buy her a new one without any hesitation.</li>
      <li>In the picture I included, the older model (the better one) is on the right and</li>
      <li>This curling iron seems very durable, heats very quickly, and gives me just the curls I am looking for.</li>
      <li>it ok, it get hot fast</li>
      <li>I opened the package, plugged in the curling iron, tried to wrap the first strand of curls around it... and it fell apart!  </li>
      <li>Would highly recommend it!!!</li>
      <li>This curling iron is well worth it.  </li>
      <li>I found this one found it economical and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
      <li>With teens using it, all the extra safety features are really nice to have.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only kind she usese.</li>
      <li>Different newer model received, I was expecting for the older model that I loved.</li>
      <li>I have thick, naturally curly (but mostly just frizzy) hair; with gel, it can be beautifully curly (or so I&#x27;m told -</li>
      <li>I loved the price and it works just as I expected!  </li>
      <li>Worked great for about a month :/</li>
      <li>However I have to slap against my hand and then press on button first in order for it to work.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it!</li>
      <li>I find it funny</li>
      <li>I bought this curling iron at walmart and the first time i used it</li>
      <li>First time I used it, unit kept turning off by itself.  </li>
      <li>perfect size to give my hair some oomph, not too big and not too small.  </li>
      <li>this curling iron does not get that hot at all.</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t get hot at all</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t curl my hair like how the first one did</li>
      <li>which is exactly what I want.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of hard to hold it accurately because of how the cord comes right out of the bottom.</li>
      <li>It is pretty easy to hit the off button as you&#x27;re using it, but another click turns it right back on.</li>
      <li>I had an older version of this curling iron, &amp; was happy to replace it when it finally broke with the same thing.</li>
      <li>while using, &amp; results are much better than using a flat iron.</li>
      <li>The only con about this product is how easily the settings can change without you knowing it.</li>
      <li>the Conair one is certainly hotter</li>
      <li>It works really well, heats up extremely quickly and the silicone sleeve was an unexpected</li>
      <li>It heats up quickly and the heat resistant top is larger enough to grip without getting too close to the heated part.</li>
      <li>Not only that, it makes excellent spiral curls that don&#x27;t look too tightly wound and skinny like a smaller iron would.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t pay much for this curling iron</li>
      <li>My hair has since grown out to about shoulder length and this iron really does the trick.  </li>
      <li>It very durable and doesn&#x27;t feel inferior in your hands.</li>
      <li>so I was very relieved to find this.  </li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>I bought this curling iron simply because I wanted try a cermaic iron and because it&#x27;s made from helen of Troy, which is a manafacturer of many professional styling tools.</li>
      <li>it does what it is supposed to do, the settings are good, ALTHOUGH it comes with a foreign plug, so if your buying this &amp; you don&#x27;t have Japanese plug or anything</li>
      <li>but I use it to smooth out some frizzy parts and create a uniformly curly/wavy look since my hair is kinky in some spots but flat in others.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and the curl does not last even when a hair stylist does it with the professional curling irons.</li>
      <li>so I babied it to make sure when I set it down</li>
      <li>After I realized that my old curling iron (1.25 inch) wasn&#x27;t really giving me the curls</li>
      <li>Also, the curling barrel isn&#x27;t super long.</li>
      <li>It may heat up in thirty seconds, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t cool off that fast and that silicone cover has protected me from burning myself after use a few times.</li>
      <li>You turn a dial on the handle to set the heat, which is intuitive and easy to do, but I did notice it moved while I was curling, turning down the heat before I was done.</li>
      <li>I have had more expensive ones with the gold overlay and did not like them because the heating element did not last more than 2 years.</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s how it&#x27;s made, or if it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough or what, but the curls will not hold at all</li>
      <li>While this curling iron is pretty standard</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ve had no problems with either the old or new version.</li>
      <li>Lastly, it never stays hot enough to do your whole head.  </li>
      <li>Clearly, it was used.</li>
      <li>and that didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as this curling iron.  </li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>My hair has natural curl and is often frizzy.</li>
      <li>I ignored the many negative reviews and purchased it anyway.</li>
      <li>I have naturally wavy hair</li>
      <li>The first one was a little different model and ended with pop and super heating-frying my hair.  </li>
      <li>- on light is too dim and you can&#x27;t tell if it is on or off easily; distance between the handle and release button is an awkward length</li>
      <li>I kept my palm around the barrel and counted, it got a little too hot at about 12 seconds and the entire barrel (up to the plastic tip) was hot at 30 seconds.</li>
      <li>My normal curling iron is the Conair Instant Heat series.</li>
      <li>I bought this curling iron because my stylist told me that it sounded like the heating element was going out on my old one &amp; I will definitely be returning it &amp; either going back to my old brand or finding something new.</li>
      <li>I hadn&#x27;t really thought about the fact that a larger barrell would only produce waves.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this because it was on a major discount</li>
      <li>A fine styler at a price that is hard to beat.</li>
      <li>I have lots of long hair, not an expert making curls but this new curler makes me look like a curler expert!</li>
      <li>I have been having a hard time finding a decent priced curling iron that would heat up fast and get hot enough to curl my thick hair quickly.  </li>
      <li>My hair generally doesn&#x27;t hold a curl well, so I had it set on the highest setting too.</li>
      <li>and it apparently did not stop heating up.  </li>
      <li>The curls that it made were the same as the old one.</li>
      <li>Even with my thick, wavy hair, it gives me smooth, long-lasting curls.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried to curl my hair like normal, two times now, thinking maybe my hair wasn&#x27;t completely dried the first time, or maybe the heat wasn&#x27;t high enough - all I have is loose frizz</li>
      <li>I gave this iron 3 star because I find that it doesn&#x27;t heat up or get as hot as the Conair instant heat --and as far as less frizz and flyaway</li>
      <li>The previous curling iron that I had was the exact same one and lasted me for years.</li>
      <li>Price was less than most other sites!!!!</li>
      <li>I was hoping that being Revlon, it would be my new go-to, but my old Conair does better even with the bad heating element.</li>
      <li>When I went to purchase a new one I had not really paid attention to brand name and made the mistake of a second purchase, only realizing my mistake after bringing it home.  </li>

<li> It may heat up in thirty seconds, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t cool off that fast and that silicone cover has protected me from burning myself after use a few times.</li>
<li> You turn a dial on the handle to set the heat, which is intuitive and easy to do, but I did notice it moved while I was curling, turning down the heat before I was done.</li>
<li> I have had more expensive ones with the gold overlay and did not like them because the heating element did not last more than 2 years.</li>
<li> , I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s how it&#x27;s made, or if it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough or what, but the curls will not hold at all</li>
<li> While this curling iron is pretty standard</li>
<li> But I&#x27;ve had no problems with either the old or new version.</li>
<li> Lastly, it never stays hot enough to do your whole head.  </li>
<li> Clearly, it was used.</li>
<li> and that didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as this curling iron.  </li>
<li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
<li> My hair has natural curl and is often frizzy.</li>
<li> I ignored the many negative reviews and purchased it anyway.</li>
<li> I have naturally wavy hair</li>
<li> The first one was a little different model and ended with pop and super heating-frying my hair.  </li>
<li> - on light is too dim and you can&#x27;t tell if it is on or off easily; distance between the handle and release button is an awkward length</li>
<li> I kept my palm around the barrel and counted, it got a little too hot at about 12 seconds and the entire barrel (up to the plastic tip) was hot at 30 seconds.</li>
<li> My normal curling iron is the Conair Instant Heat series.</li>
<li> I bought this curling iron because my stylist told me that it sounded like the heating element was going out on my old one &amp; I will definitely be returning it &amp; either going back to my old brand or finding something new.</li>
<li> I hadn&#x27;t really thought about the fact that a larger barrell would only produce waves.  </li>
<li> I ordered this because it was on a major discount</li>
<li> A fine styler at a price that is hard to beat.</li>
<li> I have lots of long hair, not an expert making curls but this new curler makes me look like a curler expert!</li>
<li> I have been having a hard time finding a decent priced curling iron that would heat up fast and get hot enough to curl my thick hair quickly.  </li>
<li> My hair generally doesn&#x27;t hold a curl well, so I had it set on the highest setting too.</li>
<li> and it apparently did not stop heating up.  </li>
<li> The curls that it made were the same as the old one.</li>
<li> Even with my thick, wavy hair, it gives me smooth, long-lasting curls.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried to curl my hair like normal, two times now, thinking maybe my hair wasn&#x27;t completely dried the first time, or maybe the heat wasn&#x27;t high enough - all I have is loose frizz</li>
<li> I gave this iron 3 star because I find that it doesn&#x27;t heat up or get as hot as the Conair instant heat --and as far as less frizz and flyaway</li>
<li> The previous curling iron that I had was the exact same one and lasted me for years.</li>
<li> Price was less than most other sites!!!!</li>
<li> I was hoping that being Revlon, it would be my new go-to, but my old Conair does better even with the bad heating element.</li>
<li> When I went to purchase a new one I had not really paid attention to brand name and made the mistake of a second purchase, only realizing my mistake after bringing it home.  </li>
<li> As far as I am concerned, the price and the durability outweighs the other concerns.</li>
<li> and I wanted to get one that would last just as long.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t take it long to get back to the temperature you wanted.</li>
<li> Two years ago I received a Revlon straightening flat iron as a gift.</li>
<li> so it&#x27;s not too complicated and easy to use</li>
<li> i have long wavy hair</li>
<li> I usually just make do with a product until it breaks, but I replaced this curling iron after many frustrating attempts to do my hair.</li>
<li> i used to buy conair 1\\&quot; curling iron until they changed the metal surface from smooth to HARSH whatever it was that broke my hair, NO curling iron has ever broken my hair</li>
<li> (The spring that holds the clamp came loose and fell off.)  </li>
<li> This new one comes with new controls, and the spinning thing that controls the heat is very loose and moves freely which is very annoying having to set the dial on the desired temperature over and over again.</li>
<li> the last reviewer only complained when some freak of nature happened to theirs.  </li>
<li> I recently returned to the States after living overseas for a few years.  </li>
<li> I bought this from Walmart today, 3/4 inch barrel (cost roughly $12).</li>
<li> Seriously I had to put an old school rubber band around it to stop it from spinning while I&#x27;m using it.</li>
<li> Other</li>
<li> (The other one was ancient, &amp; didn&#x27;t owe me anything.)</li>
<li> I added this on to an order I placed for other things</li>
<li> I ordered this a few months ago and have only used it a few times because A.)</li>
<li> My last curling iron was also a Revlon, lasted for at least 5 years</li>
<li> No problem with the heating element, but not worth the effort.</li>
<li> Unsure what the rubber case is for, it doesn&#x27;t cover the whole iron, so it is useless...</li>
<li> This curling iron heats up in less then a minute and does the job it is made to do.</li>
<li> It broke after less than a week of use.</li>
<li> I have just ordered a replacement as this one burned out in less than 9 months.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have a single complaint.</li>
<li> I think it looks awful), but I use a 1&amp;#34; curling iron to calm down the frizz &amp; make the curls big, manageable &amp; loose..</li>
<li> I had experimented with various &#x27;irons&#x27; through the years and was not very impressed.</li>
<li> I have to remind her not to do it everyday so her hair won&#x27;t be damaged.</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve checked it a few times, and it is just plain dead!</li>

<li> No more Revlon products for me.</li>
<li> it burned my hair and the setting was only on 4 needless to say it&#x27;s a piece of junk.</li>
<li> She complained about how the curls never held.</li>

<li> it too late for a refund???</li>
<li> The temperature dial is placed so that your hands are constantly twisting the dial - which could be dangerous.</li>
<li> I bought this and used it at least 6 days a week.  </li>
<li> When they say 30 seconds, they mean it.</li>
<li> &amp; I just have fluffy frizz!!</li>
<li> This is not a good option for a curling iron at all.  </li>
<li> My first experience with this product was awful.</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t want to give it any stars, but had to give it at least one to post a review!</li>
<li> I would agree that it is poorly designed, I keep bumping the temperature selection.  </li>
<li> and that makes it uncomfortable to release the hair when you want.</li>
<li> They were vtoo expensive.</li>
<li> Makes it quite difficult to maneuver and get my hair curled</li>
<li> So difficult to use.</li>
<li> The design is very poor.  </li>
<li> I honk its a very poor design.&lt;br</li>
<li> By the time I finish curling my hair, my thumb is numb.  </li>
<li> This is one  of the WORSE curling irons I&#x27;ve ever used!!  </li>
<li> So disappointed.</li>
<li> Hate to report this, but mine will not turn on/</li>
<li> but i hate how your hair can get stuck in it</li>
<li> I have been very disappointed in this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This curling iron is well worth it.  I have been having a hard time finding a decent priced curling iron that would heat up fast and get hot enough to curl my thick hair quickly.  This does the job!</li>
    <li> Hate to report this, but mine will not turn on/does not work.&lt;br /&gt;Update: I tried again....However I have to slap against my hand and then press on button first in order for it to work. (So basically seems to have flaw with \\&quot;on\\&quot; button)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it! I bought a ConAir product for her a while back and that didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as this curling iron.  She complained about how the curls never held. But now, she always curls her hair. I have to remind her not to do it everyday so her hair won&#x27;t be damaged. The only con about this product is how easily the settings can change without you knowing it. The pros are that it has even heating, the swivel cord, and it heats quickly. If her curling iron breaks, I will gladly buy her a new one without any hesitation.</li>
    <li> My first experience with this product was awful. I ordered it \\&quot;new\\&quot; and received on in ripped packaging. When I actually took the curling iron out there were water spots on it and dust. Closer inspection revealed several long blonde hairs wrapped around the base of the iron. Since I&#x27;m a brunette, and I&#x27;d only just gotten it, it couldn&#x27;t have been mine. Clearly, it was used. I sent a scathing letter to the supplier and the only response I got was a refund through Amazon, not the company I purchased from. When I asked for instructions for returning it, I finally got an answer saying no return was necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I eventually did get around to purchasing the iron elsewhere and it&#x27;s great. I bought it because it was supposed to be excellent for making \\&quot;mermaid waves\\&quot;, and it was great. Not only that, it makes excellent spiral curls that don&#x27;t look too tightly wound and skinny like a smaller iron would. It also is great for just light body waves. There isn&#x27;t a kind of curl out there this thing can&#x27;t handle, and on top of that it heats up in seconds! My old curling iron took FOREVER, but this one is awesome! Plus I love the silicone heat shield. It may heat up in thirty seconds, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t cool off that fast and that silicone cover has protected me from burning myself after use a few times.</li>
    <li> Really loving my curling iron ...&amp;#60;3&amp;#60;3 it&#x27;s every I expected heats up great!!!!! No problem recommending this product! Love love love it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is not a good option for a curling iron at all.  The ON/OFF buttons are placed so that you accidentally turn the iron off while curling.  The adjustable temp setting on the side gets changed when using this product.  Lastly, it never stays hot enough to do your whole head.  I usually just make do with a product until it breaks, but I replaced this curling iron after many frustrating attempts to do my hair.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price. Just as good as the $50+ ceramic irons at fraction of the price. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> My last curling iron was also a Revlon, lasted for at least 5 years and I wanted to get one that would last just as long. I found this one found it economical and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t snag my hair when I twist it and that it hasn&#x27;t burned my hair either. I think the only drawback is that the buttons do sound kind of plasticky when you press on them but it&#x27;s a sturdy curler so I don&#x27;t think It&#x27;ll be a problem. I&#x27;ve had this product for over six months now and still happy that I bought it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product 7 months ago and immediately had trouble with the on/off switch.  I didn&#x27;t pay much for this curling iron so I babied it to make sure when I set it down it stayed on, and had to turn it on while styling my hair if I moved it incorrectly.  However, today...I was going to use the curling iron...and it apparently did not stop heating up.  The curling iron totally fried the piece of hair off that I was trying to curl.  It fell in a frizzy clump on the counter and when I went to pick it up it disintegrated!  Never in my life have I had anything like this happen to me.  I immediately threw it away!</li>
    <li> I have used this brand before and loved it. I especially loved Amazon price! It saved me $6 vs buying it at the local store.</li>
    <li> Let me just say I have been using this curling iron for years.  Occasionally like now I purchase another one only because after a while there is buildup from hair products on mine.  This curling iron heats up in less then a minute and does the job it is made to do. It has a dial with 20 heat settings and automatic shutoff. I find it funny the last reviewer only complained when some freak of nature happened to theirs.  Other then that it appeared they were happy with it too.  Things happen.  Its inexpensive and if you want a good curling iron this one will do the trick.</li>
    <li> I opened the package, plugged in the curling iron, tried to wrap the first strand of curls around it... and it fell apart!  (The spring that holds the clamp came loose and fell off.)  This one&#x27;s going back for a refund!</li>
    <li> This is the second Revlon curling iron that I have purchased in the last year.  The first one was a little different model and ended with pop and super heating-frying my hair.  When I went to purchase a new one I had not really paid attention to brand name and made the mistake of a second purchase, only realizing my mistake after bringing it home.  I would agree with those who dislike the temp setting, it needs to be reset each use because during use it gets moved.  Otherwise it was functional enough, during its short life.  I had no problem giving it a second chance, but after 2 months it lights up, but simply does not heat up.  No more Revlon products for me.</li>
    <li> The wife doesn&#x27;t use it that much but says that it&#x27;s a great item, one of her favorites.</li>
    <li> I have been very disappointed in this product. I had this iron about a year ago and it worked okay for awhile and then one day I got a spark from the iron while curling my hair.  I thought it might have been a fluck, so I bought another one and about six months later, the spring went out on that one, so cannot use it at all.  Will not get another one.</li>
    <li> The design is very poor.  I either change the heat setting or turn it off all together every time I touch it!  No problem with the heating element, but not worth the effort.</li>
    <li> I recently returned to the States after living overseas for a few years.  This is the second dual/worldwide voltage curling iron I have owned and there seems to be a problem with it.  By the time I finish curling my hair, my thumb is numb.  Could it be electrocuting my hand?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the dial for heat and the on/off button are in a spot where I keep accidently turning it off or turning the heat up or down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the wand is a plastic piece that keeps catching my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t like this curling iron.</li>
    <li> I had not used a curling iron in many years. This curling iron seems very durable, heats very quickly, and gives me just the curls I am looking for.</li>
    <li> I just wanted a curling iron to use occasionally, and when I looked around in stores, I never saw anything that competed with this price. A good, simple curling iron- ceramic is awesome, the multiple heat settings are a nice bonus. It is pretty easy to hit the off button as you&#x27;re using it, but another click turns it right back on. Don&#x27;t see why anyone should ever spend more.</li>
    <li> I bought this curling iron at walmart and the first time i used it it burned my hair and the setting was only on 4 needless to say it&#x27;s a piece of junk. so now i have to pay for a haircut besides having to take a bus to take it back!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this from Walmart today, 3/4 inch barrel (cost roughly $12). I HAD to try it out when I got home, and let me tell you. When they say 30 seconds, they mean it. I kept my palm around the barrel and counted, it got a little too hot at about 12 seconds and the entire barrel (up to the plastic tip) was hot at 30 seconds. My hair generally doesn&#x27;t hold a curl well, so I had it set on the highest setting too. It did a perfect job. I think I love this curling iron. A lot. The price is good, I feel that the product is great, we&#x27;ll just have to see how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> This product is PERFECT!! I bought one last year to my sisters and we really loved it! I just bouth anther for me this month! Never hesitate to buy it!</li>
    <li> Revlon RV051C 1\\&quot; Tourmaline Curling Iron.  First time I used it, unit kept turning off by itself.  Would not stay on for more than 5 seconds.  Returning it.</li>
    <li> After reading previous reviews, I was skeptical but figured $8 wasn&#x27;t a big risk. I was pleasantly surprised. It works really well, heats up extremely quickly and the silicone sleeve was an unexpected bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down-side is, as others have said, that the buttons are close to where your hand sits. However, after using it a few times I&#x27;ve gotten used to the design and adjusted. Now, it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
    <li> I guess the 3 star review might be unjust because I ordered this 1&amp;#34; curling iron thinking that it was the size that I desired but after I received it I realized I should&#x27;ve ordered the 3/4&amp;#34;. I thought I&#x27;d give it a try but it just doesn&#x27;t give me the effect that I want. Decided not to pay for return charges and just added it to my collection of many curling irons!</li>
    <li> I bought this curling iron simply because I wanted try a cermaic iron and because it&#x27;s made from helen of Troy, which is a manafacturer of many professional styling tools. My normal curling iron is the Conair Instant Heat series. I gave this iron 3 star because I find that it doesn&#x27;t heat up or get as hot as the Conair instant heat --and as far as less frizz and flyaway...well, it&#x27;s about the same as the Conair Instant Heat (which is chrome barrel). I returned it and bought the Conair Ceramic curling iron, and yup the Conair one is certainly hotter (95W Conair vs 80W Revlon) which means it takes less time for me to get a curl :D</li>
    <li> This is my first curling iron, easy to use and it&#x27;s great that the chord swivels around but I keep hitting off button by accident</li>
    <li> Gave as gift, she loved it</li>
    <li> As far as I am concerned, the price and the durability outweighs the other concerns. Yes, this item has some flaws as some people have pointed out. However, after you learn to cope with them, it is fine. I just ordered another one to replace the one I have had for over 6 years. The ceramic barrel does not get corroded from my hair dye, thus it keeps heating up properly. I have had more expensive ones with the gold overlay and did not like them because the heating element did not last more than 2 years. And yes, the temperature dial gets turned, but I have learned to keep checking it. It doesn&#x27;t take it long to get back to the temperature you wanted. I have fine hair and the curl does not last even when a hair stylist does it with the professional curling irons. This iron does a great job on my hair that lasts all day.</li>
    <li> My hair has natural curl and is often frizzy. Yuck! I had experimented with various &#x27;irons&#x27; through the years and was not very impressed. Two years ago I received a Revlon straightening flat iron as a gift. It has large ceramic plates, 25 heat settings, and I absolutely love it! I was looking for a curling iron to use to create different looks and when I saw this one it reminded me of my straightener. I ignored the many negative reviews and purchased it anyway. The price alone made it worth the risk! This curling iron is simply awesome! I don&#x27;t have a single complaint. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a high performance product at an incredible price!</li>
    <li> It broke after less than a week of use. The previous curling iron that I had was the exact same one and lasted me for years. Guess I&#x27;ll stick to buying it in an actual store. The letter on on the on off buttons were faded. So disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like it it was more then what i expected thank you for the good services and i like to give 5 stares</li>
    <li> perfect size to give my hair some oomph, not too big and not too small.  I&#x27;m a hair twirling wizard these days.</li>
    <li> I decided to drastically cut my hair last summer.  It was to the middle of my back and I had it cut all the way up to around my chin.  After I realized that my old curling iron (1.25 inch) wasn&#x27;t really giving me the curls I wanted I bought this one.  I hadn&#x27;t really thought about the fact that a larger barrell would only produce waves.  My hair has since grown out to about shoulder length and this iron really does the trick.  It heats up quickly, gives me great curls that last all day and was an exceptional value.</li>
    <li> This item is of good quality. It very durable and doesn&#x27;t feel inferior in your hands. It heats up quickly and does a good job.</li>
    <li> I bought this iron a month ago. When I turned it on I was pleased with how fast if heated up. I started curling my hair, and got to the 4th curl, and the iron quit working. I&#x27;ve checked it a few times, and it is just plain dead! I am so disappointed!!!!</li>
    <li> Worked great for about a month :/ Now it won&#x27;t stay on shuts off and on repeatedly.  Going with Conair hopefully I have better luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it too late for a refund???</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been told if it&#x27;s bad/good or ok yet.&lt;br /&gt;It came in good shape, probably ok product, otherwise I would have heard something.</li>
    <li> this curling iron does not get that hot at all. I like the size of the barrel but it doesn&#x27;t get hot at all</li>
    <li> I looked all over for this curling iron and you can&#x27;t beat this price.  It is perfect for ease of use and multiple heat settings.  Heats evenly and super quick.  The cover that you can put on as soon as you unplug and be able to store immediately is so convenient!  This is a perfect go to curling iron that won&#x27;t break the bank.  Perfect tension in the clip and provides great curls!</li>
    <li> UPDATE: This broke after only one year. Another example of a formerly great product now made cheaply &amp; destined for the landfill. Will not buy from this company again.  I had an older version of this curling iron, &amp; was happy to replace it when it finally broke with the same thing. (The other one was ancient, &amp; didn&#x27;t owe me anything.) Based on the reviews, I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it ... But I&#x27;ve had no problems with either the old or new version. Very happy with my purchase. It&#x27;s light, easy to use, have had no issues with pushing buttons etc. while using, &amp; results are much better than using a flat iron.</li>
    <li> i used to buy conair 1\\&quot; curling iron until they changed the metal surface from smooth to HARSH whatever it was that broke my hair, NO curling iron has ever broken my hair so i tried revlon 1\\&quot; and this one heats up faster than any i&#x27;ve ever had.  i have long wavy hair so need it to put my hair in place, kind of straigten and curl the right way,  it just works for me and it was only 12.97 at wal mart.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this. The temperature dial is placed so that your hands are constantly twisting the dial - which could be dangerous. Seriously I had to put an old school rubber band around it to stop it from spinning while I&#x27;m using it. Also the on off switch is placed so that I&#x27;m constantly turning it off.&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;m not a newb at curling my hair either.</li>
    <li> This is one  of the WORSE curling irons I&#x27;ve ever used!!  Doesn&#x27;t hold a curl &amp; shuts off while in use. Didn&#x27;t want to give it any stars, but had to give it at least one to post a review!</li>
    <li> Stopped working after only 4 months</li>
    <li> Works great. Multiple heat settings which is terrific, and it shuts itself off. What&#x27;s not to love? As someone who forgets turn off the curling iron and has to drive back home, this is the ticket. I&#x27;ve tried leaving it to ensure it shuts off and it does turn off, so just in case you forget it gives you peace of mind. Heats quickly when it does shut off so no worries on that front.</li>
    <li> Pretty good, serves its purpose, affordable good for day to day usage. I&#x27;m a student so it&#x27;s not too complicated and easy to use</li>
    <li> I own two of these, and I&#x27;m looking to expand my collection as my hair grows out. I&#x27;ve literally had 0 problems with it. I&#x27;ve never owned a curling iron before this, so I admit, it&#x27;s something of a learning curve. But, it was simple enough and I look goooooodddd.</li>
    <li> I would agree that it is poorly designed, I keep bumping the temperature selection.  Also, it wouldn&#x27;t even curl my hair. The \\&quot;curls\\&quot; which were more like waves fell right out.</li>
    <li> I have been travelling between America and Australia and this is a life saver!  It truly is dual voltage and I&#x27;m able to use it in both countries without a problem.  I use an adapter for the plug in Australia but that&#x27;s it.  I&#x27;d already lost one curling iron to the voltage problem burning it up basically so I was very relieved to find this.  The price was fair and it arrived on time.</li>
    <li> The iron does work well and I plan to continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros- auto shut off, lots of different heat settings, cord has a rotating device so that it doesn&#x27;t tangle; end where you hold onto the barrel has a small ridge just before you get to the part of the iron that is hot so it clues you in that you are getting close to heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - on light is too dim and you can&#x27;t tell if it is on or off easily; distance between the handle and release button is an awkward length and that makes it uncomfortable to release the hair when you want.</li>
    <li> I have thick, naturally curly (but mostly just frizzy) hair; with gel, it can be beautifully curly (or so I&#x27;m told - I think it looks awful), but I use a 1&amp;#34; curling iron to calm down the frizz &amp; make the curls big, manageable &amp; loose.. I bought this curling iron because my stylist told me that it sounded like the heating element was going out on my old one &amp; I will definitely be returning it &amp; either going back to my old brand or finding something new. I&#x27;ve tried to curl my hair like normal, two times now, thinking maybe my hair wasn&#x27;t completely dried the first time, or maybe the heat wasn&#x27;t high enough - all I have is loose frizz, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s how it&#x27;s made, or if it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough or what, but the curls will not hold at all &amp; I just have fluffy frizz!! I was hoping that being Revlon, it would be my new go-to, but my old Conair does better even with the bad heating element.</li>
    <li> The temperature is great, but my hair always slips out. It makes curling my hair more of a task than it should be.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like where the on off switch is because when I do my hair I shut it off all the time</li>
    <li> I loved the price and it works just as I expected!  I would definitely purchase this again.  Love the ceramic irons.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because it was on a major discount and I&#x27;d been needing a curling iron. I ordered this a few months ago and have only used it a few times because A.) I have no idea on how to correctly curl my hair without messing it up, and B.) It&#x27;s kind of hard to hold it accurately because of how the cord comes right out of the bottom. So you&#x27;re constantly trying not to burn yourself whilst keeping the cord out of the way.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for a house in Mexico that helps mothers and children.  They love the product and were very happy to receive it.</li>
    <li> I arrive in good condition, is excellent when using it leaves the fantastic curls, hair has not abused the ideal temperature. The highly recommend, great value unsurpassed</li>
    <li> This iron surprised me, in a good way. I have a more expensive, larger barrel curling iron and was looking for one to give me tighter curls in the hopes of getting some longevity out of them. This iron does that. It heats up quickly and the heat resistant top is larger enough to grip without getting too close to the heated part. You turn a dial on the handle to set the heat, which is intuitive and easy to do, but I did notice it moved while I was curling, turning down the heat before I was done. So that&#x27;s something to be mindful of. Also, the curling barrel isn&#x27;t super long. Not an issue for me, but again, something to consider.</li>
    <li> While this curling iron is pretty standard I LOVE the heat resistant cover and auto off features. With teens using it, all the extra safety features are really nice to have.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this,  the photo matched the existing one I have.  I wanted one more exactly like it.&lt;br /&gt; But when it arrived, it was a different model, heavier and longer.&lt;br /&gt;And the picture has now been changed for the newer model.</li>
    <li> A fine styler at a price that is hard to beat. My wife checked out a couple of drugstores for a replacement styler. They were vtoo expensive. I added this on to an order I placed for other things and she was very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have been using this model and its predecessor for many years.  It heats fast at all temps great curl size, nice silicone sleeve if you have to use it then pack and run.  I buy them in two&#x27;s one for home, one for travel!</li>
    <li> Different newer model received, I was expecting for the older model that I loved. This new one comes with new controls, and the spinning thing that controls the heat is very loose and moves freely which is very annoying having to set the dial on the desired temperature over and over again. Wasn&#x27;t happy about this. Oh, well... The curls that it made were the same as the old one. In the picture I included, the older model (the better one) is on the right and the model I received was on the left.</li>
    <li> I have had this curling iron for 20 years and I am buying a replacement because mine has hairspray all over it! GREAT product!</li>
    <li> This products is really good it does what it is supposed to do, the settings are good, ALTHOUGH it comes with a foreign plug, so if your buying this &amp; you don&#x27;t have Japanese plug or anything then you&#x27;ll have to buy an adapter</li>
    <li> Used in Europe. Worked well. Unsure what the rubber case is for, it doesn&#x27;t cover the whole iron, so it is useless... the curling iron however, I would recommend.</li>
    <li> The iron heats up well, but the barrel snags my hair which. Makes it quite difficult to maneuver and get my hair curled</li>
    <li> So difficult to use. Bought it 3 years ago. Used it few times. Takes me forever to use it on my hair and besides that it doesn&#x27;t give the curls a good look, they don&#x27;t even look like curls. I honk its a very poor design.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it away. Bought a Remington CI9538 Tstudio Salon Collection Pearl Digital Ceramic Curling Wand, 1 - 1 1/2. More money but SO WOrth it. I have lots of long hair, not an expert making curls but this new curler makes me look like a curler expert! Love it.</li>
    <li> I have owned the same curling iron for several years, and when it broke I looked for a replacement, this I thought would be it, but Revlon has not made it the same way and it doesn&#x27;t curl my hair like how the first one did, why couldn&#x27;t they keep it the same way.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is just what I was looking for. It heats up quickly, is easy to use, and a great price. Even with my thick, wavy hair, it gives me smooth, long-lasting curls.</li>
    <li> i love this curling iron its amazing but i hate how your hair can get stuck in it but the price was amazing.</li>
    <li> This cheapo curling iron broke after only using it three or four times!  Piece of junk!  The spring in the clip popped out.  Of course, I don&#x27;t have the receipt or packaging now that it&#x27;s been over a week.  Grrrrr!</li>
    <li> Quality Item, great price, works wonderfully on me!!!! Would highly recommend it!!! A+++&lt;br /&gt;If you use a curling Iron I would recommend this one!  Great deal!  Price was less than most other sites!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this and used it at least 6 days a week.  I have just ordered a replacement as this one burned out in less than 9 months.  I am hopeful that my next one will be longer-lived.</li>
    <li> This has been a great curling iron for me. I have naturally wavy hair but I use it to smooth out some frizzy parts and create a uniformly curly/wavy look since my hair is kinky in some spots but flat in others. I use it on (almost) the highest setting between 25-30 and it works very quickly. Never any issues and I don&#x27;t have to think twice about it - which is exactly what I want.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it. It&#x27;s the only kind she usese.</li>
    <li> it ok, it get hot fast, it curl my the way i want it I cool i like it thanks</li>
