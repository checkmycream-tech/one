      <li>The seems remarkable for a rechargeable battery operated device.  </li>
      <li>We love the Oral-B toothbrush and these extra-soft brush heads are perfect for this toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>I really love the braun brush and the best part they give you 2-3 options  of brushes youll never get board</li>
      <li>Love it, and it was a great buy on Amazon!</li>
      <li>The best Power toothbrush replacement heads available!  </li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m happy with my deal and found these Brushes as good as i wanted.</li>
      <li>These are the greatest brush heads on earth IMESHO, but why can&#x27;t I buy more than 3 at a time and save a bit of money?</li>
      <li>So thrilled to have these!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to find them online and at a good price!</li>
      <li>Great price on Amazon and the free shipping with Prime was awesome.</li>
      <li>Perfect, I just love it, Just the way I thought it would be, works good.</li>
      <li>It was great to be able to buy this online!LOVE Amazon Prime!</li>
      <li>I do give the 4 out of 5 stars because the product itself is good, but it is not for everyone.</li>
      <li>Seem to be good, and should be since they aren&#x27;t aftermarket.</li>
      <li>They were a good value.</li>
      <li>I am delighted with this product.</li>
      <li>The dentist suggested these and it was a good suggestion.</li>
      <li>This is a good set, saves me the time from buying each one separately and also saves me money.</li>
      <li>They are a good system.</li>
      <li>and it does a good job.</li>
      <li>I did recieve my replacement brushes in good order.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>good stuff, my hygienist loves it.</li>
      <li>They work good, no problems.</li>
      <li>Theses ones are good for a month and then stat loosing their brushing strength.</li>
      <li>The heads come 3 to a package, the arrive in good order and while there are &amp;#34;wear&amp;#34; indicators built in to the coloration of the bristles, it is a good practice to change every 30 days.  </li>
      <li>Product came promply and in good condition.  </li>
      <li>Good price, and quality.</li>
      <li>If you find them listed for about $5 per brush head, that&#x27;s a good bargain (I&#x27;ve seen 1-2 sold for $18).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
      <li>always good to have the replacement heads on hand.</li>
      <li>Good quality construction.</li>
      <li>It is best to use Oral B replacement brushes rather than cheaper ones available.  </li>

      <li>I love my toothbrush</li>

      <li>Better than a Sonic</li>
      <li>I love using the extra-soft brush heads.</li>
      <li>Of course, this would also depend on how often one brushes his/her teeth; the more you brush, the likelihood would be that changing the brush head would occur sooner than every season/three months.</li>
      <li>And I love the fact that you don&#x27;t have to do the work of brushing your teeth when the Oral-B toothbrush does it for you.</li>
      <li>product speaks for itself, I&#x27;ve been a satisfied user for 8 years</li>

      <li>I love them.</li>
      <li>I have zero gum problems and I have healthy teeth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read that a manual toothbrush should be changed every 3 months and that some electric toothbrushes have better bristles and should be changed every 6 months.</li>

      <li>Glad I can get it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>These brush heads are much better than the &amp;#34;Flossing&amp;#34; one that came with my Oral-B toothbrush (Prowhite Precision 4000 Rechargeable).</li>
      <li>and I am thankful I have because it has led me to better brushing focus on the areas where teeth and gums meet.  </li>
      <li>If you try them I am sure you will agree.</li>
      <li>It works well and is better priced then some.  </li>

      <li>Better than the one my dentist sold me for $160.00.</li>
      <li>Oral B&#x27;s are a bit costly, but work much better than generics....</li>
      <li>I think the softer heads work better than the firmer heads included with the brush handle.</li>
      <li>They especially do great on the back side of molars.</li>
      <li>I love these heads.</li>
      <li>I love Amazon Prime.  </li>
      <li>and, I thought, more thorough.</li>
      <li>Much better value here than in stores.  </li>
      <li>I have used this brush for many years, never had any problems with it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m about to switch to the regulars now:)</li>
      <li>I feel that \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; head is cleaning better.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m satisfied.  </li>

      <li>I absolutely love these.  </li>
      <li>The replacement brushes fit my Brush/Braun machine allowing me to have replacements handy when the brush indicator reveals that replacement is</li>
      <li>I like these heads the most from the others but it&#x27;s best to buy all the different kinds and then decide which is best for your teeth as we all have different ones...</li>
      <li>This works well for most users.</li>
      <li>Pricing is so much better than in store even with coupon.</li>
      <li>These toothbrush heads are great and gentle to the teeth.  </li>
      <li>I get compliments on my smile when I&#x27;m out and about &amp; good</li>

      <li>whatever, it&#x27;s sure to go out of stock.  </li>
      <li>And the price was better than I&#x27;ve ever paid in 15 years.</li>
      <li>Best of the Oral B toothbrushes and that&#x27;s from a former Dental Hygienist.</li>

      <li>Also, the price was right!!  </li>
      <li>Good quality as always, more variety in USA than New Zealand.</li>
      <li>-B brush heads fit most Oral-B toothbrushes, so you can switch between types of head easily.  </li>
      <li>This is the best brush for my needs over many of the other Oral-B products available.  </li>
      <li>Softer bristles still allow for a good clean while being more gentle on your gums.</li>
      <li>I DO have to say that other than my &#x27;unsanitary&#x27; concern about these that I&#x27;ll get to in a moment, it&#x27;s great!</li>
      <li>This product is the best and value beats all other pricing.  </li>
      <li>IPad originally purchased my Oral-B 1000 on Amazon and love it.  </li>
      <li>Replace brush heads every other month for best results</li>
      <li>I get a great clean with my new toothbrush and heads.  </li>
      <li>so i&#x27;m glad i found them for such a great price.</li>
      <li>The Brushes are easy to use in my Oral B Electric Tooth Brush.  </li>
      <li>traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that they are easy to get on and off and rinse easily.</li>
      <li>My gums and teeth are easily irritated</li>
      <li>I feel that they clean better than \\&quot;Precision</li>
      <li>This also seems to clean better.</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly and have a nice clean storage box.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
      <li>They feel nice and leave my teeth feeling super clean.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps when my mouth and teeth adjust and get used to the action, I&#x27;ll return to the stiffer bristle heads, but for now these are working great and my teeth feel fabulous after brushing.</li>
      <li>I can move it all around my mouth easily.</li>
      <li>and I really love these.....fine to clean my gum and teeth.</li>
      <li>They are not that easy to find in a store.</li>
      <li>Easy to use, no bells and whistles.</li>
      <li>I had to order more of the precision clean brush heads</li>
      <li>The head is easy on the gums and removes debris that cause plaque quite well.  </li>
      <li>Appropriate markings and all that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used all the brush head types, and thought that \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; meant these would be gentle but still effective.  </li>
      <li>but it is better that the sensitive power head and my teeth get good grades at my dentist using the floss brush head.</li>
      <li>Good set of brushes for decent price.  </li>
      <li>I strongly suggest you stick with the Oral B brand for replacement heads.  </li>
      <li>Ok, I&#x27;ve tried the cheap ones and they are NO Match for the Real Thing!!!  </li>
      <li>These are excellent quality for a very good price and the shipment was received earlier than I expected!!!</li>
      <li>Arrived in good shape and received pretty quickly.  </li>
      <li>and I am very pleased with the whole process.</li>
      <li>works very well very satisfied</li>
      <li>These are the best toothbrush heads for sensitive teeth and gums!&lt;br /&gt;Regular, gentle brushing with these special spinning brush heads, will become the most comfortable teeth routine you&#x27;ll enjoy.</li>
      <li>Brush is gentle on the gums while leaving the clean feeling I expect from Oral B, all for a good price.</li>

      <li>These on Amazon are fine.</li>
      <li>First of all, i finally figured out that, for best performance, you have to stay with the Oral B heads and NOT use the knock-offs.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Brushes seem fine, I just wished these things got a bit cheaper.</li>
      <li>They were fine ...</li>

      <li>They also fit my older model Braun Professional Care electric toothbrush perfectly!</li>
      <li>the gentle brushhead makes brushing with the powerful oral b handle a pleasant experience.</li>
      <li>The brush is very soft and perfect size for sensitive teeth product.</li>
      <li>Genuine replacement, works fine.</li>
      <li>I liked the ones with the second head that moved up and down best for cleaning, but these are the next best thing and</li>
      <li>I use this toothbrush twice daily and am very pleased I did!</li>
      <li>They are a good replacement for the original brush that came with the unit when it was new.</li>
      <li>These Oral-B soft brush heads are wonderful for sensitive gums.  </li>
      <li>These soft brush heads are perfect for my sensitive gums.</li>
      <li>These replacment sensitive are well worth the price and are a great value for a three pack.</li>
      <li>This is perfect soft brush for my 2 year old daughter.</li>
      <li>Has made a huge difference.</li>
      <li>was happy to find that I could order these heads without buying an entire kit.</li>
      <li>My dentist recommended and it&#x27;s been fantastic.</li>
      <li>The bristles are the softest I&#x27;ve seen on an electric toothbrush and will not wear away your teeth and gums if light pressure is used.</li>
      <li>They fit the Oral B toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I have read where some of these replacment brushes are cheap knock-offs.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s gentle on the gums, yet effectively removes plaque).</li>
      <li>They are smaller and seem to me to do a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I just taught having an electric brush would be more fun...</li>
      <li>Worth the money, glad we tried these out.</li>
      <li>But otherwise, they fit my toothbrush</li>
      <li>These are the genuine thing.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked these so much</li>
      <li>you are using a cheap AA battery unit</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used these brush heads for several months now and they do a great job (while still leaving some enamel on my teeth).  </li>
      <li>These are gentle on my teeth and gums but effective in cleaning.</li>
      <li>Amazon does not have them available now.</li>
      <li>When i had moved in with my gf, she had brought along one of those cheap Oral-B Vitality Electric Toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>I have used these brushes for several years and they do a great job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
      <li>The cheap copies start to wiggle and almost fall apart in your mouth.  </li>
      <li>The Oral B round brushes makes my gums Happy!  </li>
      <li>They fit snugly as intended.</li>
      <li>They fit and they work.  </li>
      <li>However, they fit the appliance and do the job that I need.</li>
      <li>Comfortable.</li>
      <li>if you like your Oral-B electric tooth brush, these same-branded replacement brush heads fit perfectly.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not as comfortable.</li>
      <li>They fit our electric toothbrushes.  </li>
      <li>For some reason I haven&#x27;t been able to find the soft brush heads in stores, so I&#x27;m glad I was able to find it here.</li>
      <li>I can not say enough great things about these brush heads.</li>
      <li>Good on my sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>and it is good by far.</li>
      <li>So far so good with these replacements.  </li>
      <li>But they are good on sensitive teeth/gums like mine, so I continue to buy them.</li>
      <li>So far, so good.</li>
      <li>A good price (locally they are with $10 more) for the sake of your oral health.</li>
      <li>Really good for sensitive tooth.</li>
      <li>Good for sensitive teeth and gums.</li>
      <li>I can use it on maximum speed and feel almost nothing, which is good for sensitive gums and teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Good deal  but slow delivery over all happy with purchase.</li>
      <li>Turn to good old Amazon</li>
      <li>Also good for people with sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t be penny wise and gums foolish, get the Oral-B Sensitive.</li>
      <li>It does a good job with cleaning and soft on the gum.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good product and it&#x27;s appropriately soft.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Having sensitive teeth limits my oral hygine product choices, so having the option of an electric brush head is good</li>
      <li>It is good to change them frequently.  </li>
      <li>These are good for people with sensitive teeth too.</li>
      <li>Brushes feel good on my Sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>Nice brushes, fit Oral B unit very well.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with these, so much so, that I bought a second pack.  </li>
      <li>They are comfortable -- effective cleaning, yet gentle.  </li>
      <li>It is well manufactured, and so far this has been a good product.</li>
      <li>I needed these and to buy local was gonna cost me quite a bit more, definitely a good buy on these</li>
      <li>These soft brush heads are good for everyone&#x27;s teeth.</li>
      <li>and she was right, so I&#x27;m glad they are available here.</li>
      <li>In my honest opinion, the sensitive toothbrushes are generally a better way to clean your teeth.</li>
      <li>So excited to find them at such a great price.  </li>
      <li>I am older and my fingers do not work like they used to, but the overall quality of these brushes is excellent.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m currently pregnant and needed soft bristles since gums are sensitive during pregnancy, these fit the bill perfectly.</li>
      <li>They do not bother my sensitive gums at all and my teeth feel nice and clean!</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of powered toothbrushes - my mouth just doesn&#x27;t feel as clean when I use a manual toothbrush.</li>
      <li>They fit snugly on my existing Oral-B electric toothbrush and easily clean my teeth to almost dentist-cleaning level..  </li>
      <li>There are many manual options nowadays that have very soft fine bristles that clean between the teeth much better.</li>
      <li>My son has braces and these work the best and are also easy on his gums while getting into hard to reach areas.  </li>
      <li>The product came very fast and was a much better price than at any store in my area.  </li>
      <li>I use the Sensitive brush head and the Gentle cycle on my Oral-B Professional 5000 and love the awesome clean feeling.  </li>
      <li>so small one with circult form is the best.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with the Oral B-Sensitive Soft Brush Heads.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Amazon: Please check and confirm whether this item is an original part manufactured by Oral-B.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth ordering through auto pay and ship!</li>
      <li>I originally got the electric toothbrush because my dentist said it might help keep my mouth cleaner, but he cautioned me to get the softest brush heads</li>
      <li>These appear to be original Oral-B brushes like they sell in the stores at twice this price.  </li>
      <li>I have found that with any toothbrush, that if you hold them under running hot water, it helps to soften them up a bit more.</li>
      <li>as usual, Amazon Prime shipping is the best!</li>
      <li>It keeps my smile Healthy, feeling good &amp; looking younger  </li>
      <li>I am not disappointed.</li>
      <li>While it is said that the electric tooth brush doesn&#x27;t get your teeth any cleaner than the old hand brush, they do have the very important advantage of stimulating your gums!</li>
      <li>For the first time in my life I love brushing my teeth.  </li>
      <li>The only kind I will ever buy !</li>
      <li>Beats the medium firmness heads that come with the original purchase of the Braun.  </li>
      <li>I was happy to be able to get these brush heads, I haven&#x27;t been able to find them lately.  </li>
      <li>I bought these to replace the brush head that came with the electric toothbrush originally.  </li>
      <li>Cheaper than the stores, it&#x27;s an original Oral-B</li>
      <li>These are original from oral B</li>
      <li>The original oral-b.  </li>
      <li>This is the brand that my dentist originally recommended, and I have been using it for years and years.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say I can even notice a difference from the original head in my Precision Clean...</li>
      <li>These replacements fit my electric toothbrush perfectly; however, I still feel that the bristles are too hard.</li>
      <li>My mouth still gets very clean and yet it is very gentle on my gums.</li>
      <li>My dentist confirmed that although I was getting my teeth and gums clean, also due to good flossing, my gums were doing better with the electric toothbrush</li>
      <li>The three pack is handy to have in the lavatory draw when a new brush is needed.</li>
      <li>done leaving your teeth feeling clean and polished as they should.</li>
      <li>so I HAVE to have things clean or it grosses me out.  </li>
      <li>The electric toothbrush gets your mouth clean.</li>
      <li>These clean just as well</li>
      <li>I read excellent reviews for Oral-B  and have always used extra soft tooth brushes.  </li>
      <li>clean but save the enamel.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Since I started using these compact heads, my dentist tells me that I have exceptionally clean teeth.  </li>
      <li>Teeth feel all clean n stuff</li>
      <li>My teeth feel totally clean when I do that.</li>
      <li>yet I feel like a have clean teeth.</li>
      <li>Need these to clean under bonded wire</li>
      <li>They clean your teeth well, without causing bleeding or discomfort.</li>
      <li>My teeth feel clean and shining.  </li>
      <li>My teeth feel so clean after brushing.  </li>
      <li>The teeth are clean but the gums started to recede.</li>
      <li>I still use a manual brush for my tongue but can get it almost as clean as with the Oral B.</li>
      <li>My teeth feel really clean.</li>
      <li>My teeth are so damn clean</li>
      <li>Brush heads provide a dentist clean feeling every time.  </li>
      <li>They clean throughly without abraison.</li>
      <li>but it would be much better if more stores carried soft bristled brushes</li>
      <li>They interchange for the type clean wanted.  </li>
      <li>Clean teeth and gums</li>
      <li>These keep my teeth clean without hurting.</li>
      <li>No problems, clean teeth</li>
      <li>and you can tell that the vibrations are no long as good as they should be.</li>
      <li>We switched from the Floss Action brush heads to these and are so glad we did!  </li>
      <li>but the heads had gotten pretty worn out - these made it good as new again.</li>
      <li>, I brush 2-3 times per day, floss, clean my tongue, take showers every day, my bathroom is not musty - it&#x27;s clean &amp; smells good, my home is clean - in fact I&#x27;m actually somewhat of a germaphobe</li>
      <li>They are very gentle on your teeth&#x27;s enamel but not sacrificing getting them squeaky clean!</li>
      <li>This is the most reasonably priced place to find original replacement heads.  </li>
      <li>What a difference this automatic toothbrush has made on my special needs son&#x27;s teeth.  </li>
      <li>There is nothing really special about this purchase to comment on.</li>
      <li>the right size I was looking for!</li>
      <li>particular type of brush head supplied with that set, proved to be most comfortable.</li>
      <li>Softer than the regular brush heads, but still clean as just good.</li>
      <li>Best one, hard to get in stores now.</li>
      <li>These extra soft brush heads are perfect and they are hard to find in the store; so ordering a years worth at time is wonderful</li>
      <li>It is not ridiculously soft and seems perfect for a sensitive mouth.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Product as expected, happy with it all.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing</li>
      <li>I have sensitive teeth and these heads are amazing.  </li>
      <li>The head moves in a spinning motion but does not make a full 360</li>
      <li>I used another highly-rated electric toothbrush for three years and never had as good a dental checkup as this last one.</li>
      <li>These fit the electric brush I bought years ago but rarely used before.</li>
      <li>They are soft and effective  </li>
      <li>I never liked to change the brush heads on my Oral B toothbrush until I found out about this awesome product.</li>
      <li>This is my absolute favorite toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>they last quite awhile, do a good job, and don&#x27;t pull apart.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have full blown recession or temperature sensitivity - thank goodness, but I tend to stress about it anyway.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been buying these brushes for some time now and never could find them for a good price locally.</li>
      <li>Brushes are nice and soft, which have not irritated my gums.</li>
      <li>The brushes do a nice job of cleaning my sensitive teeth with no problems noted.</li>
      <li>Almost a full $10 cheaper on Amazon.</li>
      <li>The heads are much more gentle on teeth and gums</li>
      <li>I also appreciated the subscription which I signed-up for as there was a coupon that was automatically applied to my order resulting in a much better price.</li>
      <li>It feels nice and soft against teeth &amp; gums.</li>
      <li>These brushes are nice and sensitive...</li>
      <li>It is also more gentle on my gum.</li>
      <li>Now this brush seems to really remove all that as I concentrate the brush more to my gumline.  </li>
      <li>; BRUSH (TRIED ANOTHER THAT CAME WITH THE TOOTHBRUSH) AND THE SENSITVE BRUSH IS SOOO MUCH MORE GENTLE TO MY TEETH AND MOUTH.</li>
      <li>We were taught that straight, soft toothbrushes like the old Oral-B 40&#x27;s were best.</li>
      <li>these were WAY cheaper then the ones at my local store, they work well and are good for my teeth</li>
      <li>I should have paid more attention to the user ratings and spent more money on a better toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I could never do a good job of cleaning his teeth with a regular tooth brush.  </li>
      <li>I recommend everyone who wants to take better care of their teeth to try it.</li>
      <li>Good quality and, thankfully, only have to order one style replacement part of the attachment set for Waterpik.</li>
      <li>thanks Oral B :)</li>
      <li>My teeth love this product and it is gentle on my gums.</li>
      <li>and it makes me mouth feel super clean.  </li>
      <li>Much more gentle on my aging teeth and gums.</li>
      <li>but the bristles feel dense enough to do a really good job.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just learning about battery-operated toothbrushes, and I have sensitive teeth, so I am happy to use these brush heads with my new Oral-B toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>These work very well, good for sensitive gums, but clean well.</li>
      <li>They fit the Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision OralB</li>
      <li>Apparently, the comment requires six more words!</li>
      <li>So the original brand is definitely worth it for me.</li>
      <li>While a manual toothbrush is fine to use - appreciate the consistent pressure that a brush head provides.  </li>
      <li>and they are super to this point.</li>
      <li>I plan to order more and like the fact that soft brush heads are available.</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>The speed it cleans the teeth is super.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve been using the product for a month now and it still works well; shipping was also quick.</li>
      <li>Package arrived quickly and was well packaged.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>Works way better than a regular manual toothbrush at mantaining healthy teeth and gums.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s very easy and uncomplicated to use, the charge on the toothbrush portion holds for a long time, these toothbrushes are really comfortable, stay on just fine</li>
      <li>Got so excited when I saw the price of this product that ordered it right away, but so frustared when I tried it.</li>
      <li>fits right on and works like original OEM replacement.  </li>
      <li>Very good cleaning with these yet gentle enough not to irritate my very tender gums.</li>
      <li>These are very soft and cleans pretty nicely.</li>
      <li>provide the right amount of firmness to clean my teeth, but not &amp;#34;stress&amp;#34; my gums.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive gums and Oral-B Extra Soft Brush feels light as a feather going across my gums no matter the pressure and yet cleans my teeth wonderfully.  </li>
      <li>Yeah exactly, thats why I go with the genuine oral-b heads.</li>
      <li>If your gums are more normal, you might not need these brush heads.  </li>
      <li>The replacement brush heads fit exactly as described.</li>
      <li>I bought these after finding the standard brush heads a bit &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34; and am very pleased with the purchased.</li>
      <li>I need softer toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;This is better than the normal ones.&lt;br</li>
      <li>These are perfect for getting my teeth super clean without making my gums worse.  </li>
      <li>I bought the Oral_B Professional Healthy Clean Precision electric toothbrush and these heads.  </li>
      <li>Great job and don&#x27;t wear down your gums.</li>
      <li>Comfortable and clean very well even though they are extra-soft.  </li>
      <li>These are just replacement brush heads - nothing special about them - but they&#x27;re the right ones and convenient to buy from Amazon.</li>
      <li>I was happy to find them here for 50% less and on Subscribe &amp; Save too.  </li>
      <li>This were exactly what I expected and were cheaper too than what I saw in the stores, a great deal</li>
      <li>It is soft enough to where it will not irritate your gums but will provide a great clean for your teeth.</li>
      <li>Last a long time and am very happy with them.</li>
      <li>as she got very sensitive gums so for her they work much better then</li>
      <li>; love to get these needed refills online at Amazon; these sensitive are always better for my sensitive teeth and clean well</li>
      <li>The bush is very gentle on the gum line and still keep my teeth clean.</li>
      <li>-- that is a first for me!  </li>
      <li>So glad to find sensitive replacement heads!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
      <li>Once I got them in the mail, I immediately brushed my teeth and was so glad I bought them!</li>
      <li>It not only provides new brushes but is a great reminder to change in a timely manner.</li>
      <li>The brushhead is very soft, good for sensitive gum.</li>
      <li>it was shipped right away and arrived quickly, despite it being during the Christmas rush.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and fine quality</li>
      <li>I chose the gentle brush which works fine for me.</li>
      <li>I found here a little cheaper price, but quality is good and accurately described.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The Oral-B is a good interim toothbrush, but with even the lightest &amp;#34;mis-use&amp;#34; one can wear down gum tissue in the process of trying to clean thoroughly.</li>
      <li>The Oral-B&#x27;s design is more flush - flat if you will so gunk can easily get in so you have to rinse it out thoroughly after each use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The Oral-B&#x27;s design is more flush - flat if you will so gunk can easily get in so you have to rinse it out thoroughly after each use.    </li>
      <li>I have even, on occasion, used these heads on an uncharged handle and that&#x27;s really when I notice that the power really does make a huge difference!</li>
      <li>Great for everyday use.</li>
      <li>Oral-B is my favorite electric toothbrush and the sensitive heads make it easier to tolerate for someone who has more sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>and they fit my type which is the cheap one it says oral b and braun on it and is a basic charging stand with light</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re a bit pricey but worth it.</li>
      <li>Much more comfortable that the regular brush heads.</li>
      <li>But they do seem to be worth it.  </li>
      <li>I prefer the soft headed bristles because they are more dense in packing.</li>
      <li>Better than any soft bristle on the market.</li>
      <li>They not only priced the item most cost effectively, but I truly appreciated the $2.99 S&amp;H for my whole shipment.</li>
      <li>It is worth the price.  </li>
      <li>so you have to purchase more frequently.  </li>
      <li>It would be nice to have something that could pop on the brush head especially when</li>
      <li>but now my teeth are even more sensitive in areas than before.</li>
      <li>Well worth the price for the multipack.</li>
      <li>These toothbrush heads are being sold for much more than the soft bristle heads</li>
      <li>I have sensitive gums and am so glad I bought these extras.  </li>
      <li>These were definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>Since I changed to the Sensitive type, my dental checkups have gone much better</li>
      <li>so I thought maybe switching to the sensitive head would be better for my gums.</li>
      <li>I got this soft toothbrush because I was hoping it would do a better job of cleaning my teeth, and getting into the nooks and crannies.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if these were going to be too soft but that has not been the case.</li>
      <li>you have no problems with gums, it&#x27;s better for you to buy Floss Action or Prowhite.</li>
      <li>It cleans well and leaves my mouth feeling fresh.  </li>
      <li>The extra soft is great for gums.</li>
      <li>They are soft enough to win my dentist&#x27;s approval and not tear apart my gums.</li>
      <li>The Brush heads are soft but not to soft they do a good job cleaning your teeth and add Sensodyne tooth paste</li>
      <li>you have a winning combination for sensitive teeth .</li>
      <li>Very much worth the price</li>
      <li>Buying the name-brand is really worth it.  </li>
      <li>Ended up trying the Oral-B toothbrush, with this extra soft brush head, and it works great.  </li>
      <li>Great toothbrush, especially if you have sensitive gums.</li>
      <li>well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you have an Oral-B brush, use the name brand, its worth it.</li>
      <li>My mouth always feels so fresh after I brush with this head,</li>
      <li>well worth getting these if you have sesitive teeth or gums.</li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t much exciting to say about these replacement toothbrush heads.  </li>
      <li>We love this sensitive head for the Oral-B brush.  </li>
      <li>as expected, good price.</li>
      <li>I ran out of my replaceable brushes for my Oral B brush so I ordered Oral B sensitive (3 pack) more.  </li>
      <li>Love these soft bristles.</li>
      <li>My husband need a soft toothbrush and was glad to find it here.</li>
      <li>I think they are meant more for people with sensitive gums not teeth.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m sticking to the Oral-B brand, and I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve accidently discovered the brushes for sensitive teeth,</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I ordered these soft bristled brushes as I would imagine</li>
      <li>I love these soft tooth brushes by oral -b  </li>
      <li>Have to use extra soft manual toothbrushes so was very glad to find these as I love to use an electric toothbrush but didn&#x27;t want to risk injuring my gums more by continuing to use regular heads.</li>
      <li>Work well for a good cleaning with the Oral-B Professional Deep Clean Brush.  </li>
      <li>Exactly as described with quick delivery.</li>
      <li>Good price vs. other places.</li>
      <li>These brushes appear to be the real deal and work just like the original brushes.</li>
      <li>They are much softer then that original brush.</li>
      <li>The brushes came on time, in good shape and are working out extremely well.  </li>
      <li>These type of bristles are great for scrubbing stubborn particles, but not really that great for everyday cleaning of teeth especially when you use toothpaste that has fine abrasive particles.</li>
      <li>This, extra-soft brush are right for me.</li>
      <li>(so I may have additional feedback after some time), but right now I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.  </li>
      <li>But when it came, it wasn&#x27;t the right thing.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re just right for me.</li>
      <li>, just right.</li>
      <li>These are just the right size.</li>
      <li>His advice plus brushing after every meal and at bedtime was right on.  </li>
      <li>Try getting them from Amazon and see if I am right.</li>
      <li>The price is right for my budget.</li>
      <li>With the new sensitive brush heads, we are all more comfortable now.</li>
      <li>my teeth really feel clean.</li>
      <li>As good as expected ;)</li>
      <li>and so they get four stars, but you&#x27;ll need to frequently clean the whole system.</li>
      <li>They clean thoroughly but gently.  </li>
      <li>We loves Oral B, so this a purchase we use to buy, easy and very soft.</li>
      <li>I anticipate having to change these more often than the regular ones, since the bristles are more soft, but it is worth the comfort.</li>
      <li>Sonicare is a better cleaning machine, but if your mouth is pretty clean already, or have sensitive gums, this brush works very well, and is very gentle.</li>
      <li>His gums are in such good shape now that his new hygientist cannot believe he ever was sent to a periodontist.</li>
      <li>it feels better on my teeth, more like brushing and a lot less like a mechanical device</li>
      <li>/&gt;The brushes which came from this vendor are exactly what you would expect: they are a decent price and they work fine</li>
      <li>The heads which came with the new Oral B electric are like concrete, so we doubly appreciated these great soft heads.  </li>
      <li>While I have not used any of these brush heads, they are like the one which came on my new Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000 rechargeable electric unit.</li>
      <li>I switched from the regular Oral-B brush head to this Extra Soft Brush head with wonderful results.&lt;br /&gt;Dentist asked us to focus the brush on the teeth</li>
      <li>I find this brush to be far more comfortable to use than the standard Oral-B brush head -- no gum irritation at all, but it still gets my teeth feeling clean.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive teeth (as do many of us of a certain age), and I find I&#x27;m not as thorough in brushing as I need to be.  </li>
      <li>Not much to say other than these work great and are usually a much better price than in the store.</li>
      <li>I use this Oral-B toothbrush [[ASIN:B002HWS9GG Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Floss Action Precision 5000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush(packaging may vary)]] , and this brush head fits</li>
      <li>These brush heads provide safe, thorough, gentle cleaning for sensitive teeth and gums.  </li>
      <li>The soft brushes are better for dental care and really work for me.</li>
      <li>Love these Sensitive tooth brush tips, I have been using them for years, the dental hygienist is always surprised how clean my teeth are.</li>
      <li>They no longer have white patches and really look nice.  </li>
      <li>we go through them so quick very pricey.</li>
      <li>Soft brisles on the brush and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Much easier on my gums than the regular kind.</li>
      <li>Happy checkups with regular daily use combined with flossing and a fluoride rinse.</li>
      <li>Holds charge well, keeps teeth clean, is easy to use, and it can use various interchangeable brush heads.</li>
      <li>These fit our Oral-B electric toothbrushes; I think we have 3 different ones and they fit them all.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m no dental professional, but I do think that high abrasiveness isn&#x27;t the best thing for teeth or gums, so I think that the Extra Sensitive heads give my teeth &amp; gums the cleaning they need, without adding more opportunity for further erosion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the package was damaged and looks like so cheap and coming from very old inventory.</li>
      <li>I appreciate very much that you have provided me with this product.</li>
      <li>The price was very reasonable and it was convenient to order the brushes.  </li>
      <li>The brush moves very fast and</li>
      <li>so they are very gentle on the gum.</li>
      <li>These are very reasonable and works well with my oral b electrical toothbrush.</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
      <li>My husband likes these very much.</li>
      <li>I bought the tooth brush years ago for a very reasonable price (like $20).  </li>
      <li>It cleans your teeth, is very gentle on the gums</li>
      <li>Shipment was very fast from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Very fast</li>
      <li>Seller was also great -- speedily shipped the product, and shipping was free though the total was less than $20</li>
      <li>I use it every evening and it seems to be clener than a brush and softer and more comfortable than the other brushes that came with my unit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It really does clean your teeth very well.</li>
      <li>As we get older (and my husband takes blood thinners) our gums and teeth become more sensitive.  </li>
      <li>Works great with Oral-B 4000 which lets you know when you are brushing too hard.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive gums and these are very gentle on them but still get my teeth clean.</li>
      <li>Brushing my teeth is so much easier with Oral-B, and the sensitive brush heads are perfect for someone like me who has been warned by dentists not to brush too hard lest I cause damage to my already-slightly-receded gums.</li>
      <li>thanks to Amazon for making them available at a price comparable to normal good-quality toothbrush prices ($3-3.50 ea), depending on the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>thanks to Amazon for making them available at a price comparable to normal good-quality toothbrush prices ($3-3.50 ea), depending on the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>More gentle that the floss action one and cleans very well.</li>
      <li>Got genuine ones from Amazon, so far they seem like that.</li>
      <li>JUST BACK FOR MORE.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly what i needed for my Oral-B toothbrush.</li>
      <li>and sure enough, it&#x27;s not me!</li>
      <li>I SHOULD be able to use it until the blue indicator bristles tell me that I need to change it and not any sooner.  </li>
      <li>and sure enough, it&#x27;s not me!</li>
      <li>, I want to simply rinse the brush &amp; handle after each use and store it away like I&#x27;m supposed to be able to do.  </li>
      <li>I SHOULD be able to use it until the blue indicator bristles tell me that I need to change it and not any sooner.   </li>
      <li>I have a an electric tooth brush, I needed some brush heads, and this order  was exactly what I needed to do the job![[ASIN:</li>
      <li>The first shipment is sort (3) brushes, I sent an email to request.</li>
      <li>and although I probably could have found locally, this was much more convenient</li>
      <li>When I searched for replacement heads for the Oral-B CrossAction Power, this is the product that came up first.</li>
      <li>At first I was hesitant to use a power toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I am a first time user but product meets my expectations.  </li>
      <li>, Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>would not recommend these for anyone except a brand-new power brush user (for the first brush, while your gums get used to power brushing).  </li>
      <li>They also cost a bit more, but in my opinion you get extra use out of them.</li>
      <li>(If you&#x27;re interested, the company is called Recycline / Preserve.</li>
      <li>But, I can only keep so many.</li>
      <li>But, I can only keep so many.</li>
      <li>Most people get waaaayyy to abrasive with the standard oral-b electric brushes.</li>
      <li>In the future I will be purchasing the drug store brand of these brushes which will be much more cost effecrive.</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>I love the oral B When I am using it regularly and then use a manual tooth brush</li>
      <li>Will purchase more in the future.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I got them for my kid&#x27;s first electric brush.</li>
      <li>The only thing I wish they did was offer more colors to help us distinguish between the brushes.</li>
      <li>My wife needs soft toothbrushes and these fit the bill.  </li>
      <li>exactly what I need.</li>
      <li>but I wish they would hold up better and last longer.</li>
      <li>AT ALL AND MORE LIKE A REGULAR TOOTHBRUSH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They work really well, but I wish they were cheaper!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;These aren&#x27;t as soft as they make them sound.  </li>
      <li>I bought my first electric toothbrush months ago</li>
      <li>&amp; when I got these I really appreciated their solidness!</li>
      <li>I love how the timer helps you figure out when to move to the next section of teeth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll submit more info later,</li>
      <li>I go to my dentist later this month, so will also be interesting to see if they notice any changes after a month of use.</li>
      <li>These heads are very well made!</li>
      <li>I will definitely buy more.  </li>
      <li>They are comfortable on my sensitive teeth and gums.</li>
      <li>Exactly what they say they are.  </li>
      <li>$27 I paid for 6 was  only 4 dollars more than for 3 Oral B brushes at drug  store.</li>
      <li>This was one of my first experiences with a product like this</li>
      <li>This generation of e toothbrush is significantly better than the last Oral B.  </li>
      <li>Definitely will get some more as needed.</li>
      <li>Dont get fooled by the cheap offers on groupon.  </li>
      <li>The product does exactly what it is suppose to do.  </li>
      <li>I have used four of the 12 in the first 9 months</li>
      <li>I have been buying these for several years and just love them.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted and needed.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using them for over 6 years, and just love them...</li>
      <li>I will be purchasing more as will be needed in the future.</li>
      <li>This is the second set I have ordered of these brushes, and I don&#x27;t think I need to say any more.</li>
      <li>First off</li>
      <li>Fit brush well, just not as soft as I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stocked a lot of these that would probably last me 2 years, that&#x27;s how much I love it.</li>
      <li>The pricing is substantially better than what i can find locally.</li>
      <li>Has 5 different brushing modes which deffinately makes for an interesting brushing experiance.</li>
      <li>Thanks!  </li>
      <li>The smaller brush works better because you can angle the brush and get the bristles in between the teeth.</li>
      <li>First electric brush, these heads work as described.</li>
      <li>These brush heads are very soft but still clean well.</li>
      <li>Even then, they seem to clean better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They both work great but don&#x27;t last very long</li>
      <li>My gums easily bleed,  and these soft brushes really help keep my gums from getting sore.  </li>
      <li>I was very relieved the brushes fit my tooth brush as it is very old.  </li>
      <li>The Oral-B sensitive head is great for getting in and around all the tight spaces in your mouth without tearing up your gums.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use any other kind.</li>
      <li>I liked other heads</li>
      <li>I always try to keep them in use as long as is healthy, and when they&#x27;re no longer good for my mouth, I put them to work in my cleaning toolkit, for scrubbing other things (great for behind faucets, some jewelry, the toothbrush itself, etc.)</li>
      <li>I always try to keep them in use as long as is healthy, and when they&#x27;re no longer good for my mouth, I put them to work in my cleaning toolkit, for scrubbing other things (great for behind faucets, some jewelry, the toothbrush itself, etc.)</li>
      <li>They are not too hard on the gums or teeth and most importantly they clean very well.</li>
      <li>I have a receding gum line and therefore am very careful about what kind of toothbrush and toothbrush head I used.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered these Oral B heads for a few years now, and they&#x27;re great for my sensitive teeth.  </li>
      <li>They are soft and by using an electric toothbrush I can hold the brush head against the tooth itself, avoiding the gum line, let the vibrating bristles get my teeth sparkling clean and keep my gums healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The bristles are soft and pliable yet seem to clean well.  </li>
      <li>Our dentist recommends only SENSITIVE oral B (or any kind) tooth-brush heads, or tooth brushes.  </li>
      <li>Love the soft sensitive bristles.</li>
      <li>Oral B Power Sensitive replacement electric toothbrushes are the only ones of their kind I use.</li>
      <li>inner bristles though are medium, so you have to make sure you don&#x27;t apply too much pressure to prevent the medium bristles from hitting your gum line.</li>
      <li>The after-market heads I&#x27;ve tried don&#x27;t fit quite as well and for me, the extra cost is worth it.</li>
      <li>These heads certainly deliver on that front, I have used them ever since and will always keep some handy, dont think i have found any other tooth brush that works for me as well with these heads.</li>
      <li>my gums bleed, they never bleed and that right there told me enough and confirmed with my dentist</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able purchase these from Amazon and not pay a ridiculous price!</li>
      <li>The Brush heads arrived quickly , they where at a much lower price than the local discount store and they where original Oral-B brushes .What else</li>
      <li>I rated it a 4 rather than a 5 because there may be other heads that work even better, but I&#x27;ve been using the same model for years &amp; it does a really good job of cleaning your teeth, partly because it utilizes a timer to let you know when two minutes are up, which makes it more likely that you won&#x27;t do just a cursory brushing as we all tend to do with a standard brush.  </li>
      <li>Good quality brush heads below the price usually found at drug and grocery stores etc.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Selected this one based on other reviews and was surprised by how good it was.</li>
      <li>this particular form like more because three pieces for replace is the one that we regular find in the market but</li>
      <li>The bristles are falling out very quickly, much more quickly than on previous orders.  </li>
      <li>They clean well, but are gentle on sensitive gums.</li>
      <li>These gentle brush heads get my teeth clean without aggravating the sensitive area at the gumline.</li>
      <li>My local stores, including the big box stores, usually have these available, but Amazon had a better price and, by bundling, I was able to have free shipping.</li>
      <li>These clean your teeth ten times better and faster than any regular tooth brush ever will.</li>
      <li>Super soft replacement heads.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure why these aren&#x27;t more widely available, but they are great.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Strong enough to get your teeth and gums clean, but sensitive enough to provide a comfortable brushing experience.</li>
      <li>They had a strong vibration to them that actually hurt my teeth and gums and were a lot noisier.</li>
      <li>while brushing then certainly a mixture of that &amp; water runs over the handle area and if not everytime you brush then SOMETIMES some of the gunk gets</li>
      <li>and I try to be certain that none of that residue is neither on the electric toothbrush handle portion (where the brush sticks &amp; on the bottom where you place the charger) AND</li>
      <li>Fiber construction that reaches in-between teeth instead of the large nubbies.</li>
      <li>I bought three extra packages of these brushes to go with the Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean &amp; Floss Action Precision 5000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>After too many years of orthodontic correction, I have developed a sensitivity to regular toothbrushes (even those deemed &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;).</li>
      <li>As an older adult, I find the extra soft to be more comfortable on my gums.</li>
      <li>Unlike some, they fit my toothbrush fine, but the sound the motor started making indicated that it was working very hard.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended for sensitive teeth, gets all teeth clean, would buy again.</li>
      <li>The product finally received was fine.</li>
      <li>sensitive bristles are extremely soft and also fine.</li>
      <li>much to add for simple brush heads, correct brand and all fine.</li>
      <li>you can give your mouth a good scrubbing without doing damage from hard bristles.  </li>
      <li>Good price for hard to find item delivered to your home.</li>
      <li>I recommend them very highly and they are so reasonable in price.</li>
      <li>Very happy with this item; had hard time finding the sensitive ones in my local stores.</li>
      <li>After spending some time looking at them and the various sites that describe the differences between the real and the fakes brushes I concluded that the ones I got are genuine.</li>
      <li>They fit on the toothbrush much easier than generic heads that I bought at a store.</li>
      <li>In short, I was really happy when these arrived in the mail a few days after ordering.  </li>
      <li>The whole family seem to be liking them.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>Still, much easier on the teeth and gets the job</li>
      <li>We really like them, though.</li>
      <li>What more can you say about a product that does what you expected?</li>
      <li>This really out cleans either of those, you will feel the difference when you run your tongue over your teeth.  </li>
      <li>gums seem much healthier.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and efficient.</li>
      <li>These work very well.  </li>
      <li>Genuine product from German.</li>
      <li>Anyway these work really well</li>
      <li>Have not yet been in for a check up but really like them at the moment.</li>
      <li>Wish they didn&#x27;t cost so much...</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Thanks so much.</li>
      <li>This is the real thing.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the real deal and</li>
      <li>really good.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also, it gives your gums a break from too much brushing as that can literally brush away your gums.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recomend this product to any one who really cares about the condition and looks of their teeth.</li>
      <li>and they wear out really fast.</li>
      <li>REALLY</li>
      <li>Much easier and cheaper to order from Amazon.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s much softer.  </li>
      <li>Thanks to lots of coffee and tea</li>
      <li>&amp; I do really like their razors)</li>
      <li>Gentle, but wish they were recycled &amp; recyclable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many</li>
      <li>Gentle, but wish they were recycled &amp; recyclable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many</li>
      <li>They are definitely worth the effort to get these sensitive brushes.</li>
      <li>This is probably because with electric toothbrushes you don&#x27;t use as much pressure on your teeth.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is the real thing.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Much much much cheaper than in the stores.</li>
      <li>Fast service</li>
      <li>I really like the way that these brushes go around my gums without being abrasive.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a convenient way to buy these things, if you don&#x27;t get out much, I guess.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery too.</li>
      <li>could buy the whole toothbrush with a brush head on it and an additional brush head for the price of just 3 heads.</li>
      <li>I prefer these because they are gentle on the gums.</li>
      <li>The extra-soft brush heads are gentle and just what the dentist advised.  </li>
      <li>It really helps when you visit your dentist.</li>
      <li>These heads fit on a basic oral B electric tooth brush.  </li>
      <li>The difference is very noticeable to my hygienist and to me.</li>
      <li>They gently brush away the food and tartar on my teeth.</li>
      <li>I am a dentist, and I really like this tip for my electric toothbrush.</li>
      <li>Much easier to brush with than a manual.</li>
      <li>The brush on the unit performs very well, so I anticipate these brush heads will do likewise.</li>
      <li>Thanks, Amazon.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I really like it as well as a polisher head to keep coffee from staining my teeth.  </li>
      <li>Real money saver.</li>
      <li>My dentist says to brush my teeth as gently as if i were cleaning a strand of pearls.</li>
      <li>Gentle on the gums</li>
      <li>How much does it cost to make them?</li>
      <li>How much can you say about refills?</li>
      <li>They are gentle on the gums.  </li>
      <li>Not so reasonable.  </li>
      <li>Much easier on my teeth,</li>
      <li>fast ship&lt;br /&gt;glad</li>
      <li>It cleans well and is gentle on the gums.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Own both a sonicare essence and the oral B. Overall cheaper than the sonicare and the rotating heads give me at least the illusion that it cleans better, however, cleaning the head is an issue as the hole in the front below the head is a bacteria trap.</li>
      <li>All my local stores quit carrying the extra soft toothbrush heads which are great for sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>It works really well.  </li>
      <li>Sold and recommended by my very finicky dentist.</li>
      <li>They fit my Braun powered toothbrush--Braun and Oral-B are owned by the same company.  </li>
      <li>Much softer on the gums.  </li>
      <li>This is the only brush head that she is comfortable with.</li>
      <li>I like this softer brush much better than the harder bristle brushes although I switch off with</li>
      <li>The brush heads really hold up to the number of brushings I put them through.  </li>
      <li>The bristles also get between your teeth very well.  </li>
      <li>I was expecting a much softer bristle</li>
      <li>This is working very well.</li>
      <li>I was about to through the whole thing away.</li>
      <li>Does its job and is really gentle on teeth and gums.</li>
      <li>Very sturdy and really brushes well.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t know brushing my teeth could be this comfortable and still get the job done properly.  </li>
      <li>The rotating part is taller, narrower, and much softer than the floss-action--</li>
      <li>All toothbrushes should be this gentle.</li>
      <li>Also much cheaper to purchase online.</li>
      <li>My hygienist really sees the difference with these.</li>
      <li>This is the real deal.</li>
      <li>But these really have made all the difference.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
      <li>have always had oral b  toothbrushes &amp; intensely dislike this one - for the ist time.</li>
      <li>softer bristles are gentle on the gumline and reduce wear on exposed roots&lt;</li>
      <li>thanks Amazon..</li>
      <li>They are gentle on enamel, but get the job done.</li>
      <li>It works very well---it is a keeper</li>
      <li>I like them better than the standard &#x27;Professional Precision&#x27; brush from Oral-B.</li>
      <li>These heads at least for me, do a good job in getting between the teeth and</li>
      <li>but either are far better than using a regular brush.</li>
      <li>I like the sensitive toothbrush heads better then the regular ones.</li>
      <li>I like them better than the flossing-action and the regular soft brush heads.</li>
      <li>In retrospect by saving a few dollars per toothhead I was damaging my gums permanently - something worth more than $5.</li>
      <li>THe bristles are soft enough that they don&#x27;t cause any discomfort, but these heads still do an outstanding job of cleaning their teeth.</li>
      <li>I love these - they are gentle and not to soft- have extra ones on hand if you brush 3 times a day.</li>
      <li>I like the sensitive heads much more than the regular ones.</li>
      <li>Overall these are my favorite brush heads because they&#x27;re soft.</li>
      <li>keep separate is new for me, here in Latin America first it not common to see, and find first we got the toothbrush</li>
      <li>Soft and does not hurt the gums!!!</li>
      <li>After buying store brand brush heads labeled ok for my oral B toothbrush, I found they did not fit right.</li>
      <li>the brush is very soft, I like it very much.  </li>
      <li>Overall, this brush head is more comfortable than any other brush head or tooth brush I have used.</li>
      <li>They were brand new, and were exactly what I needed for my Oral-B Toothbrush.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use and has lasted  a long time.  </li>
      <li>Much softer than the standard brush head that originally came with my toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive teeth and cannot use any other kind.  </li>
      <li>They work fine,not sure what you can really write about a toothbrush head other then that.</li>
      <li>My husband is disabled and I brush his teeth for him, and these are nice and soft and have lasted very, very well.  </li>
      <li>There isnt too much you can write about when reviewing a toothbrush head; however, i would most definitely recommend this product for those who have sensitive teeth and want something that is strong enough to clean but gentle enough for the sensitive teeth/gums.</li>
      <li>I like these brush heads better than some of the other styles for the Oral-B, and, really, they all clean about the same.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Since this was my first electric toothbrush, I couldn&#x27;t compare any former experience and simply didn&#x27;t know any better.  </li>
      <li>The are same quality as the ones that originally came with the brush</li>
      <li>Although these brush heads are marketed as extra-soft, they also seem to cup my teeth better than the other brush heads.  </li>
      <li>I have the other top rated, and got this for my wife.  </li>
      <li>I think this is better than the other brand I have.  </li>
      <li>No need for the exotic shapes and features of other electric brushes.  </li>
      <li>These are a workable, low price alternative to original equipment.</li>
      <li>This is softer than many of the other oral-b toothbrush head refills.</li>
      <li>I thought they were supposed to be the same as what was originally on my brush, but they weren&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;They wear fairly well though not quite as long as the regular soft brushes.  </li>
      <li>In typical fashion from Oral-B/Braun these are very good, they could be softer as calling them Extra-Soft is a little bit of a stretch.</li>
      <li>They thoroughly clean my teeth, just as the regular brush heads used to do.</li>
      <li>My toothbrush has a two-minute timer, which is enough time to thoroughly clean your teeth.</li>
      <li>These clean just as well as the regular heads.</li>
      <li>Leaves your teeth clean like if you left the dentist office.</li>
      <li>It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, massaging your gums, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs.  </li>
      <li>My son bought a Sonic to try to keep his orthodontic braces clean and, as it was bought at Costco, came with a second handle.</li>
      <li>My teeth never got this clean when I was using my regular toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>batteries).The result is my teeth comes out so clean that I will not go back to manual toothbrush again.</li>
      <li>I feel that they get my teeth just as clean as the regular ones.  </li>
      <li>my main Braun electric toothbrush and these are far superior and worth the extra cost if you need an extra soft brush for sensitive teeth or gums.  </li>
      <li>Been using the Oral B Professional electric tooth brush for many years and am always amazed at how long the machine has lasted.  </li>
      <li>They are very gentle but still provide a complete cleaning.  </li>
      <li>Soft bristles, cleans very gently.</li>
      <li>Very gentle on my sensitive teeth.  </li>
      <li>Unlike other brands and regular brushes, the Oral-B extra soft is really excellent for sensitive gums.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Super soft for sensitive gums.</li>
      <li>Extra soft bristles are easy on the teeth and gums.  </li>
      <li>It has been becoming more and more difficult to find them in the stores locally for sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>These are nice replacement heads, but after using these for several years, I have come to realize they are not actually that sensitive when it comes to toothbrush heads.</li>
      <li>I like this toothbrush since its much gentler than normal Oral-B toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>First time trying out the &#x27;sensitive&#x27; replacements.</li>
      <li>I was glad to have found an affordable toothbrush for sensitive teeth and extra soft brush head.</li>
      <li>And work pretty well so far.</li>
      <li>SO MY MOUTH IS PRETTY SENSITIVE AT TIMES.</li>
      <li>These are for sensitive teeth and gums and they are gentle!</li>
      <li>This one makes my gum feels good as its soft, but it&#x27;s hard enough to make my teeth clean.</li>
      <li>The sensitive heads are so much gentler on my gums!</li>
      <li>I love using this Oral-B toothbrush with the sensitive brush heads as my gums can be sensitive to a regular toothbrush.</li>
      <li>Does not clean as well as the original brush and wears too quickly</li>
      <li>I actually have to change them MUCH more often than normal and wipe down my electric toothbrush handle with peroxide &amp; a clean washcloth (since I didn&#x27;t know where the smell was coming from)</li>
      <li>They also lose their color over time, to remind you to toss it and put on a new one!</li>
      <li>They are much gentler on my gums and teeth, and seem to do the same effective job as the other Oral-B heads I have tried.</li>
      <li>I prefer the sensitive brush head because the bristles are soft and flat across the top.</li>
      <li>Better than my previous one.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s impossible to find extra-soft brush-head replacements for my Oral B electric toothbrush, so this was wonderful.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve saved lots of money by being able to have my teeth cleaned less often.</li>
      <li>My favorite replacement for my Oral-B Precision Black 7000.</li>
      <li>These work well with my older model Oral-B toothbrush</li>
      <li>I could because most people essentially brush their gums away with the standard stiffness brushes.  </li>
      <li>Decent price, too.</li>
      <li>Only place I could find toothbrush to fit for sensitive teeth, thankful I could order them.</li>
      <li>Worked for me, decent price.  </li>
      <li>price was  about $6 more than Rite Aid  generic brand for same quantity  6 brushes.</li>
      <li>Just watch for the sales, because prices can vary tremendously for the same item.</li>
      <li>As I have gotten older</li>
      <li>This one feels more \\&quot;snug\\&quot; (harder to pull off) than the Floss Action which came with the brush.</li>
      <li>I bought a generic replacement awhile ago and had to dump it right after 1 usage as it&#x27;s never the same compared to the original one.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive gums and this product gently cleans and removes plaque.</li>
      <li>Very soft and gently on your teeth and gums</li>
      <li>week later, when you order from some one that sell for Amazon, your review is working very fast!</li>
      <li>Wife was not to keen on the new Oral-B Sensitive at first and said that see would give it a try but didn&#x27;t realy like the bruch head.</li>
      <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend and will buy again.</li>
      <li>I reccomend this product highly.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>then I highly recommend you stop.</li>
      <li>These are the one highly recommended by dentists for people with weak/bleeding gums.</li>
      <li>can highly  recommend  it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend splurging on these brush heads.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Would recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I rated this product with 5 stars for the high quality of the product.  </li>
      <li>but Id highly recommend buying elsewhere</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Glad I could save a little through Amazon.</li>
      <li>Wal-Mart and Target both charge nearly $27 dollars!!</li>
      <li>Still, I find that I have to frequently take the brush head off and clean it with anti-bacterial cloths or it gets caked with gunk - that part of the brush never goes in the mouth, but somehow it still gets gross.</li>
      <li>Fantastic if you have more sensitive gums or even just don&#x27;t want to feel like you&#x27;re brushing with a tough brush head.  </li>
      <li>Love this replacement brushes and it&#x27;s so much cheaper than Rite Aid and other retailers!!!</li>
      <li>Not to the extent that using them is painful, it just makes me wonder which is best.</li>
      <li>I really like the soft brushes as they save the enamel on my teeth.  </li>
      <li>teeth and the soft brushes are really very helpful.</li>
      <li>I really like the soft brush heads.</li>
      <li>It came with a much stiffer brush which my mouth did not like, so I purchased these soft bristle heads.  </li>
      <li>as clearly they dont care much about Amazon customers.</li>
      <li>She like to brush her teeth with this type of heads because its soft and doesn&#x27;t irritate gums that much</li>
      <li>These brush heads are soft and gently on my gums.</li>
      <li>If your dentist wants you to have a soft toothbrush this can be it.  </li>
      <li>I really like how soft the heads are, which will help me in reducing my gum recession.</li>
      <li>lightly hold agains teeth and be careful along gum line.  </li>
      <li>And for $19.88 plus shipping I would have expected to receive 4 brushes, to fit the 4 slots in my toothbrush holder in the Braun Oral B.</li>
      <li>The soft brush don&#x27;t scratch my teeth&#x27;s enamel so much.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive gums, especially near the inside front teeth.  </li>
      <li>The extra soft is much more gentle than the standard soft.  </li>
      <li>I prefer the round style which rotates, over the &amp;#34;up and down&amp;#34; competition electric brush because I feel I have more control.  </li>
      <li>and they looked like the authentic replacements but were much cheaper and a small plastic part broke almost immediately.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also worth noting that they don&#x27;t feel much different once on the handle and rotating.</li>
      <li>he said trying to use generic on the teeth isn&#x27;t worth it</li>
      <li>AND I stick the toothbrush heads through a clean cycle in my dishwasher every week or hot, hot water and let it air dry AND rotate brush heads so each one gets a chance to thoroughly dry.  </li>
      <li>While the other ones do a fine job, I prefer these heads.  </li>
      <li>Soft but not weak, gets the job done.</li>
      <li>Only place I can fine the EXTRA soft brush head at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Despite the high price, this product has the appearance of a cheap imitation.</li>
      <li>these smaller heads work great for small mouths (3 year old and six year old son&#x27;s, so far no cavities)</li>
      <li>I have tried several of the other brush heads for this series of electric brushes and this one is, by far, the most gentle brush made for this particular electric brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But these were the original ones and work as expected on my Oral B 5000 brush handle.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t buy cheap ones from other manufacturers.</li>
      <li>The original brush heads that come on the toothbrush was so rough on our gums.</li>
      <li>, my  mouth is very tender.. and will bleed  most of the time when I brush my teeth,, but with the new soft brushs no more bleeding.</li>
      <li>When these brushes get worn out, I swap them out with a new one</li>
      <li>works with the new triumph too.</li>
      <li>It is recommended that you change to a new brush head every season.</li>
      <li>I have tried the new ones and they hurt my teeth and gums.</li>
      <li>I have gum problems and wanted to tried a new toothbrush.</li>
      <li>Name brand, new and correct product.</li>
      <li>people with sensitive teeth (and honestly anyone because you&#x27;re not supposed to scrub your teeth too hard when you brush)</li>
      <li>Like these as unlike the other heads they are super gentle on your teeth.</li>
      <li>Using and alternating between both the soft and the Floss Action works very well for me.</li>
      <li>I really like that these replacement heads are soft bristles, as I have sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>particularly if you have sensitive teeth</li>
      <li>The sensitive head is so much nicer to my gums and teeth than the floss action.</li>
      <li>Going back to the official heads made me appreciate how quiet and smooth the brush and handle operated.</li>
      <li>The drugstores often carry only their own house brands with just a few national brands.</li>
      <li>these are still a big savings from the store price, and they fit snuggly &amp; the brush part doesn&#x27;t wobble like the generic ones did.</li>
      <li>The Oral-B sensitive extra soft brush heads are gentle on sensitive teeth and gums and are worth getting.</li>
      <li>For me my hygenist has had only good things to say about my gums for the last 4 visits, you can do the math to derive the TYPICAL time period that would be covered by 4 visits.  </li>
      <li>Purchased direct from Amazon - brushes appeared genuine Oral B, right down to the high price (nearly double what they were 2 years ago!).  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive teeth</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive gums and these</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive teeth</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive gums that bleed a lot when I brush my teeth.  </li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t you find a material to use that will provide a very soft bristle without being so expensive?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does not feel very much softer, if at all, than the regular one.</li>
      <li>Very soft.</li>
      <li>It is VERY soft.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend to those with sensitive teeth or residing gum line.</li>
      <li>These heads are very soft on your teeth and gums.  </li>
      <li>Very soft brush heads.</li>
      <li>Since I had baby teeth, I&#x27;ve had very sensitive gums.</li>
      <li>My gums are very sensitive</li>
      <li>Very soft bristles.</li>
      <li>none come with the product curious to see how long they last so far so good</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really soft for my sensitive teeth!!</li>
      <li>The regular head is rough on my gums; the sensitive cleans as well or better and is easier on the gums.</li>
      <li>Beware the \\&quot;generic\\&quot; replacement heads which look alike, but are usually priced lower and offer more heads for a given price.</li>
      <li>Whenever I have, due to necessity, used the standard, non-sensitive heads, I have noticed that they seem to be much more abrasive on my gums.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use anything except a soft bristled brush!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a pretty big difference.</li>
      <li>What ever I do, it will be with my Oral B electric tooth brush and the Oral B Sensitive head!</li>
      <li>They work fine if slightly upright, but that&#x27;s impractical as you try to brush your teeth.</li>
      <li>the key word is SENSITIVE, as one can use them freely to massage the gums without causing any inflammation and you can actually push the bristles between your teeth without damaging your gums.</li>
      <li>These are the exact heads I need, but couldn&#x27;t find in the local stores.  </li>
      <li>Like these very well because not rough on gums in use.</li>
      <li>They remind me of a quote from the first three-blade razor commercial - \\&quot;Because you&#x27;ll buy</li>
      <li>The bristles are soft on teeth and gums and for people who have tender gums that is a must have!</li>
      <li>I have sensitive teeth and these don&#x27;t bother me one bit!  </li>
      <li>I bit too soft!</li>
      <li>I like it more than the other regular one.</li>
      <li>These work well on my sensitive teeth!</li>
      <li>Took some getting used to at first, since I was used to the regular manual toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>Delivery is quick, right to our door, the globe is small.</li>
      <li>Second I did not feel my teeth were clean enough and soon after felt I needed to brush them again.</li>
      <li>My favourite ever, keeps teeth clean while maintaining gum&#x27;s health with no harm done to as in the case of other brush</li>
      <li>They clean my teeth extremely well.  </li>
      <li>This product fits and brushes the way my original heads did, and while I am sad I wasted $20.00 on the store brand, I am happy I invested the additional sum for these brushes.</li>
      <li>Brushes are soft and leave your teeth feeling brand new.</li>
      <li>These replacement toothbrush heads fit my toothbrush and last a long time.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years and it is easy on my teeth</li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;m an average brusher (twice or more daily)</li>
      <li>The toothbrush handle itself is over a decade old, has been in use twice daily since its purchase, and seems to work as well as when I first got it.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive gums, but my dentist has told me I am at a higher risk of receding gums, so I thought these might help prevent further deterioration.  </li>
      <li>I bought this soft toothbrush  head because my teeth is getting very sensitive.</li>
      <li>This tip is very soft, it doesn&#x27;t hurt sensitive gum.</li>
      <li>glad that Oral B makes soft tips because dentist said that normal head was being too hard on my gums and leading to sensitivity.</li>
      <li>I tried the others like the normal one (one that comes for free), prowhite and floss action replacements but they were all too harsh.</li>
      <li>Our set was full of pink!</li>
      <li>perfect, impossible to find locally.</li>
      <li>no enamel abrasions, still keeps them super white, removing or preventing coffee, tea and red wine stains,</li>
      <li>I do not know if they will last as long as the original ones that came with the Oral B toothbrush.</li>
      <li>That little oval shaped cavity at the bottom of the brush somehow gets filled with red mold very quickly and because it leads to the inner working of the brush head the inside gets gross too.</li>
      <li>: On several occasions, I swapped to a manual toothbrush to be certain that it&#x27;s not me</li>
      <li>IT IS NOT STIFF</li>
      <li>The extra-soft variety of these brush heads is impossible to find on the shelf at local stores, so I was glad to find it online at such a good price.</li>
      <li>These brush heads are easier on my sensitive gums than regular toothbrushes and brush heads that I have tried, even the super soft regular toothbrushes.  </li>
      <li>Just be sure to rinse before putting back in the holder or the inside gets a little goopy.</li>
      <li>Like these, they are easier on the gums and I can apply a little more pressure, I feel like with the extra pressure</li>
      <li>These heads are softer and cause less gum irritation that the original brush heads.  </li>
      <li>I love it, it allows me to thoroughly brush without worrying about brushing too hard</li>
      <li>Oral B brush heads are getting hard to find in my area, so I was glad to find them on Amazon.</li>
      <li>We love these sensitive toothbrush heads and find it hard to purchase anywhere else.  </li>
      <li>I much prefer the floss action ones and will order those next time.</li>
      <li>I REALLY NEED THE EXTRA SOFT.</li>
      <li>However, upon receipt, the package clearly states:</li>
      <li>This brush is less abrasive than the Precision Clean brush.  </li>
      <li>I use the Oral-B Sensitive Replacement brushes because they are much softer on the gums versus the standard replacement brush.  </li>
      <li>I really like them so far and plan to continue using only these.</li>
      <li>but....they are worth it and to buy them elsewhere, it&#x27;s gonna be MORE expensive</li>
      <li>Asking speaking with my dentist and they recommending the Oral-B Professional Precision 5000, I found that I needed a much softer brush head than the ones that comes standard.</li>
      <li>The extra soft heads are my favourite as they are gentle to my gums.</li>
      <li>At least in my case, many years of use of these heads has not resulted in any noticeable damage compared to what the old handheld toothbrushes did to me.</li>
      <li>Her tip for me was to gently MASSAGE  my gums after brushing, she indicated to me that I should only do this with a SOFT bristle, FOR ME this has worked out well, you milage may vary</li>
      <li>So, I guess the sensitive heads are at least subconsciously better.</li>
      <li>Not sold on the shaft design, but the bristles are gentle enough.</li>
      <li>The bristles are way to soft.</li>
      <li>in ordering the sensitive brush my dental doctor recommended the softest I can purchase to reduce gum problems.</li>
      <li>They are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive teeth and gums.</li>
      <li>These soft brush heads are just what i needed.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m an aggressive brusher (which is why I want a soft brush--I wear away my enamel).  </li>
      <li>If you have sensitive teeth and require a truly soft brush, or if you plan to use this brush for children, I couldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using my Oral-B Professional Care electric toothbrush set with these Oral-B Sensitive brush heads for over 4yrs now.  </li>

      <li>I am 78 years old</li>
      <li>I have sensitive gums and these</li>

      <li>These sensitive heads are the softest I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this brush head for anyone with sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>decided to also try these sensitive head brushes besides what came with the toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>I use them with the Oral B 5000 electric toothbrush in sensitive mode.  </li>
      <li>I searched everywhere for oral b soft brush head</li>
      <li>This head has plenty of massage action though.</li>
      <li>Always need to replace our old brushes.</li>
      <li>I clicked on &#x27;buy with one click&#x27; when I saw that this product was 6 or 7 dollars cheaper on-line than in the drugstore--without checking the old, &#x27;shipping and handling&#x27; dodge.</li>

      <li>I have been using Tom&#x27;s Sensitive tooth paste but am thinking about switching to Organic Coconut Oil.</li>
      <li>For years I used floss and a somewhat  soft manual toothbrush, and plaque tended to collect in spite of flossing.  </li>
      <li>Recommend to anyone with sensitive teeth who uses an electric toothbrush</li>
      <li>The bristles are soft on this brush, and they spin in circular action.  </li>
      <li>However, I don&#x27;t think the brush is as soft as described.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
      <li>so I prefer the soft brushes rather than something else.  </li>
      <li>The soft bristles allow me to work them in between the teeth without damaging the soft tissues.</li>
      <li>She had purchased a three pack of the floss action heads, so i decided to use it to keep up with my teeth hygiene.</li>
      <li>Well let me just say that that experience was well learned and a lesson that i learned that i needed a sensitive tooth brush head.</li>
      <li>I am a young guy, but i am just so blessed with sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>Wow what a difference between this and the floss action, as well as just a manual toothbrush.</li>
      <li>My husband has sensitive gums and loves these.  </li>
      <li>is a softer bristle for my sensitive gum area.</li>
      <li>Much softer than the regular Oral-B head.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive gums that like to recede and sensitive nerves when my sinuses are bothering me.</li>
      <li>A must have for anyone with sensitive gums &amp; teeth</li>
      <li>It cleans my teeth and mouth in complete fashion.  </li>
      <li>I was really surprised about that.  </li>
      <li>and they are the sensitive extra-soft head which is my preference.  </li>
      <li>My dental hygienist recommended a soft bristled head so it wouldn&#x27;t damage my gums.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 89 years old without a cavity or filling in my mouth</li>
      <li>and I still have my naturally grown teeth.  </li>
      <li>A dentist friend suggested the Electric Oral B Tooth Brush and the Sensitive replaceable brushes.  </li>
      <li>Were delivered promptly and will continue to purchase the Oral B Sensitive toothbrush head replacements.</li>

      <li>Sensitive teeth are not causing discomfort now.  </li>
      <li>i Love the soft smaller round heads for my sensitive gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>We don&#x27;t like the larger brushes as much.</li>
      <li>And I find the 30 second timer and pressure sensor to be very helpful.  </li>
      <li>The OEM are much better/softer than the generic ones.</li>
      <li>The brush is so soft on my teeth and gums.</li>
      <li>I would not recommend it for someone who has sensitive gums, or is prone to mouth sores.  </li>

      <li>Oral-B Sensitive (3 Extra-Soft Brush heads)</li>
      <li>I bought them specifically for my young daughter.</li>
      <li>so I use these even though I do not have sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>Switched to the sensitive heads after my dentist said the flossing heads are too aggressive on my gums.  </li>
      <li>The soft brush heads are gentler on your gums and enamel.  </li>
      <li>Much prefer these to the standard brushes.</li>

      <li>Cheaper than the store by far.</li>
      <li>I need to use soft brush heads for my Oral B power toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>I tried these brush heads as my teeth are sensitive.</li>
      <li>it did not help the sensitive teeth, they were still sensitive.</li>
      <li>I recommend them for anyone with sensitive teeth issues.</li>
      <li>Those looking for a name brand sensitive replacement head, this it it.</li>
      <li>The brushes are soft, but not too soft.</li>
      <li>My hubby and I both have sensitive teeth, and these replacement heads are just the thing for us.  </li>
      <li>He says the brush starts getting soft in about a month</li>
      <li>, I will let my next dental appointment be the real test.</li>
      <li>The bristles are a bit too soft.</li>
      <li>This is the only site where I have been able to find this product as it is not available in the stores in my area.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s difficult to find the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; brushes, let alone for a good price.  </li>
      <li>Good brushes and not too expensive.</li>
      <li>Good but expensive.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if these are original oral-b or just cheap imitation.</li>
      <li>but rather it rotates about 90 degrees to the left then back to the right.</li>
      <li>with these extra soft ones i brush the same as with regular ones and i dont feel the pain but still get clean teeth with ease.</li>
      <li>It is small and circular in shape so that you can easily brush ever surface of each tooth.</li>
      <li>They are different in that they have a different brissel pattern and they help clean different areas of the teeth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands but they feel cheap, fall apart or just don&#x27;t measure up to the same quality as these.</li>
      <li>These aren&#x27;t original equipment and they sometimes slip gears or don&#x27;t work as expected but for the price I just throw the ones that don&#x27;t work away and move on to the next in the package.</li>
      <li>I would recommend them to anyone who wants a really good cleaning without irritating your gums!!</li>
      <li>I think the only downside to this great little brush is the hole in the middle which means toothpaste runs down the handle after you&#x27;re done brushing (and eventually onto the counter).</li>
      <li>These sensitive brushes are hard to find in stores, but apparently are better for one&#x27;s teeth and gums than the others.  </li>
      <li>Soft bristles , just what i wanted, anyone with a sensetive mouth or especially sensitive gums will know that its hard to find the right balance of soft bristles that are firm enough to make sure it gets the job done.</li>
      <li>I would totally recommend this to anyone who cannot afford one of the high end electric toothbrushes with a sensitive mode.</li>
      <li>I hoped that they would be as successful and of similar quality to those in the expensive kit.</li>
      <li>but mostly they are small enough</li>
      <li>Accordingly, I would rate my overall experience as fair and I am not sure if I would order other products from this company</li>
      <li>A little louder, but not bad.  </li>
      <li>This rechargeable provides strong, hard brushing, even with soft btushes.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this brush and this seller as I did not see this type in the local stores.</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend over standard brushes.</li>
      <li>so I gave him the handle for an extra and bought a new Oral B as my old one had no battery life.</li>
      <li>These brush heads are large enough to cover every tooth, yet soft enough that they don&#x27;t damage your enamel.  </li>
      <li>In the past a new brush always seemed too harsh, and by the time it was feeling more gentle</li>
      <li>They were very expensive to buy in the stores, so I was happy to find them on Amazon.com.  </li>
      <li>Usually, \\&quot;Dual Clean\\&quot; heads also were available, but I do not like them.</li>
      <li>They are no where near as soft as Rotadent brushes which I would consider extra soft.</li>
      <li>are back to normal now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My teeth feel the same as they did when I was using the normal head.</li>
      <li>The heads were exactly what we expected and work great.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The shipping was prompt, the product was well packaged and exactly what I expected.  </li>
      <li>Not as soft as the soft disposable chew sticks but much softer than all the other Oral-B heads.</li>
      <li>I could no longer find the regular brushes (without the new plastic &#x27;thingys&#x27;</li>
      <li>They really are the same as I once bought locally and now can&#x27;t find, but</li>
      <li>nothing exciting here, the less you pay for it the happier you will be.  </li>
      <li>Everyone has soft or medium etc, but not the extra soft which my dentist recommends I use.</li>
      <li>These were gentle on my gum line and you can definitely still feel the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; that your standard brush head will give you.</li>
      <li>This brush is soft enough for sensitive teeth, something which had deterred me from buying an electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Further, why can&#x27;t a company make a fully oscillating head since these are the only heads that showed any improvement over the toothbrush in a very reliable study?</li>
      <li>I think we all must take an action here, go back to buy at department store near you to stop this s</li>
      <li>Oral-B seems to be following the template that computer printer manufacturers have developed: make the price of the main unit (in this case, the charger and brush handle; in HP&#x27;s case, the inkjet or laser printer) artificially low and then recover your costs by jacking up the price of the refills (the brush heads and the ink cartridges).</li>
      <li>I like brushing with Oral-B&#x27;s sensitive, extra soft brush heads.  </li>
      <li>These include floss action, sensitive, regular, etc.</li>
      <li>I had read a few complaints in other reviews about fit and quality, but these seem to be exactly the same as those I have purchased for years, and I have never had any problems.  </li>
      <li>Because I have very sensitive teeth and gums I need a product such as this.</li>
      <li>My wife can&#x27;t use the regular brushes as her teeth are very sensitive.</li>
      <li>My husband has very sensitive teeth and receding gums and this brush works especially well for him.  </li>
      <li>I had trouble with bristles falling out from the very first use.  </li>
      <li>I use these extra soft brushes in mine so not to irritate my gums!</li>
      <li>This brush head gives my teeth a very clean feeling, and I can reach way back to the hard to get teeth.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>I was afraid I was going to get a cheap knock off versions of the original Oral B Brush Heads as I&#x27;ve seen those before around.</li>
      <li>At first, the vastly smaller size made me feel like it was ineffective, but I actually think it forces me to focus on brushing each tooth/gum and also helps with the timer because I actually spend a few second on each tooth which takes me the full two minutes.</li>
      <li>I agree that these are a little pricey, but well worth it.</li>
      <li>These work really well to clean my teeth without irritating my gums.</li>
      <li>Also like the warning light if you&#x27;re pressing too hard.</li>
      <li>these brushes are hard to get now, amazon has always had them available on line.</li>
      <li>highly recommend them even though they&lt;br /&gt;are more expensive than the generics.</li>
      <li>This results in minimum \\&quot;medieval\\&quot; type of cleaning with a sharp tool or the use of ultrasonic cleaner that they just love to use just above the gum which results in less discomfort after a vist to the dental hygienist.  </li>
      <li>They are gentle and last a long time.</li>
      <li>So I decided to order some additional brush heads that were extra soft because of the wear on my teeth surfaces.</li>
      <li>Well, as you brush your teeth, if you put too much toothpaste on, some of it can leak into this teeny opening OR if you are careful and no toothpaste / toothsoap run off gets on the handle</li>
      <li>When I read the reviews of the Oral-B electric toothbrush, I ordered these soft brush heads at the same time as the electric toothbrush itself.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for sensitive replacement heads at the local pharmacies and supermarkets but could not find it.</li>
      <li>I can no longer find the Oral-B Power Sensitive Replacement toothbrush at the local stores.</li>
      <li>This soft head is the only one I can use for my tender gums.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s extra soft and doesn&#x27;t irritate my gums at all.</li>
      <li>The toothbrushes came as represented, 2 soft packs of 3 extra soft/sensitive brush heads per item x5, they did not increase S&amp;H with the increased order quantity, and shipment was received 2 days before the estimated delivery time.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t last as long but its worth it in the long run.  </li>
      <li>you have sensitive gums, USE THIS BRUSH ONLY!</li>
      <li>These are by no means soft, but softer I suppose than the regular ones maybe.  </li>
      <li>My dentist told me I should only be using the soft toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>My wife likes the extra soft brush and I like the medium one.</li>
      <li>extra soft brush heads,&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
      <li>I prefer sensitive as my dentist has always recommended the softest brush possible.</li>
      <li>We prefer the extra soft brushes as they are easier on the gums.</li>
      <li>Using Oral-B Sensitive brush heads has improved ny dental health as well as reducing the wear and tear on my gums that a regular brush would produce.</li>
      <li>I bought this product because it probably has the highest bristle density, and the bristles are extra soft</li>
      <li>I have several sensitive  teeth.</li>
      <li>My dentist told me my gums are starting to recede and I need a soft toothbrush head.  </li>
      <li>outside bristles seem to be as soft as the dentist recomended.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Like extra soft brushes so this is the answer for me.</li>
      <li>I had stopped using an electric toothbrush entirely until I found the Oral-B Sensitive and these toothbrush heads.</li>
      <li>Use-wise, it feels like it&#x27;s not too soft, and gives just enough</li>
      <li>I needed to get some extra brushes for my [[ASIN:B003UKKHB4 Oral-b 3000 Professional Care 3000 Electric Toothbrush]]</li>
      <li>I received the extra soft heads like I ordered.</li>
      <li>I had problems with soreness and bleeding when using regular soft tooth brushes.  </li>
      <li>If you have a similar problem with soreness or bleeding, I would also suggest that you use a toothpaste for sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>This is my second order for the Oral-B Sensitive Extra Soft Brush heads from Amazon.com</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and the item works as expected.</li>
      <li>These are extra soft heads</li>
      <li>You too might be worried that the soft bristles might not brush enough, but they do.&lt;br</li>
      <li>These heads are hopefully soft enough to accomplish that.</li>
      <li>I switched from the regular brush head to the sensitive head to protect from over brushing at the gum line.  </li>
      <li>This came in a non-retail packaging (makes me think it&#x27;s refurbished) and when attempting to submit for rebate as offered, I received a notification back from Oral-B stating that the UPC code sent in with the rebate form was invalid, despite the fact that it came directly off of the packaging that was sent.  </li>
      <li>I always try to buy my Oral-B sensitive brush heads from Amazon. com because they are cheaper than in the local stores.  </li>
      <li>All dentists recommend now adays to go with a soft brush head whenever possible, as there is no noticable increase in plaque removal going with a rougher brush.  </li>
      <li>I never realized a sensitive brush head existed until recently.  </li>
      <li>It says extra soft brush heads- which they are in feel..</li>
      <li>my dentist tells me soft or extra soft are the only two options for brushes.</li>
      <li>I have been using the generic brushes marked &amp;#34;Soft&amp;#34;as</li>
      <li>Especially if you floss anyway, the sensitive heads are easier on your mouth and seem to work just as well.</li>
      <li>extra soft bristles for my toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Had gotten so that even using sensitive toothpaste with the regular heads wasn&#x27;t helping.  </li>
      <li>The sensitive brush head is smaller and gentler on the gums and hopefully keeps tartar at bay.</li>
      <li>The sensitive brushes, like the regular ones, work well.  </li>
      <li>Kind of expensive, though.</li>
      <li>The compact round head lets me get behind those back molars and gives a great massage to my gums.  </li>
      <li>Kind of expensive</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, you do have to buy the tooth brush replacement heads from time to time which are pretty expensive, but well worth the cost since the tooth brush system is so good at cleaning your teeth.  </li>
      <li>a tad ok not great</li>
      <li>When I use a new one, I run hot water over it for a few seconds for the first few uses to make the bristles a bit softer.</li>
      <li>The other kind you have to really pay attention not to press down too hard</li>
      <li>The regular ones hurt my gums, especially when they are new.</li>
      <li>I recently purchased a new toothbrush, and got this extra &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; for a spare.</li>
      <li>I also use Sensodyne Pronamel which has made my teeth much stronger and less sensitive.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need a new toothbrush as long as I can get these replacement brushes.  </li>
      <li>Item came on time and was exactly as advertised and cost less than elsewhere&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
      <li>I have a very old Oral-B electric toothbrush and it has been a long time since I replaced the brush heads.  </li>
      <li>With the correct tooth past and this product I keep the clean and white.  </li>
      <li>Great brushes, but is a little expensive without sales.  </li>
      <li>Went for my checkup after using the Oral-B toothbrush and these brush heads for four months and the hygienist remarked that she hardly had to do anything since everything was so clean</li>
      <li>They are much \\&quot;kinder\\&quot; to my gums than other brush heads.</li>
      <li>Unlike other items that popped up on a search for Oral-B toothbrush heads, these are real Oral-B quality and you can tell.</li>
      <li>The brushes are comfortable and last typically around 3 months, which is about as long as you can expect toothbrushes to last.</li>
      <li>My teeth are very sensitive and I have no trouble with this the way I did with the other styles.</li>
      <li>However, I will say that they&#x27;re genuine, as a lot of bad knockoffs are available.</li>
      <li>Threw the sensitive brush heads away and went back to the regular brush heads and our teeth</li>
      <li>I have an Oral-B Pro Series toothbrush, and I only buy these Extra Sensitive heads.</li>
      <li>I use this basically once a week while using an actual soft brush 6 nights a week to prevent further recession.</li>
      <li>that the standard adult Flexisoft EB17 has dual colors, while the Extrasoft heads are all blue.</li>
      <li>and they actually fit my approximately twenty year old Braun tooth brush.</li>
      <li>they made this extra soft for kids and especially for gum receding people</li>
      <li>The name-brand ones are relatively long-lasting, but pricey; however, I&#x27;ve purchased non-name brand ones (from Target), which I did not like--not soft enough.</li>
      <li>sensitive replacement heads are difficult to find in store or dentist office - glad I can get a 3 pack ...</li>
      <li>Well my background is using the sensitive function on a more expensive Oral-B electric toothbrush.</li>
      <li>They are as expected, classic brush heads replacements, I like the fact that they are soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Highly recommended - electronic toothbrushes take a little time to get used to, these brushes make it natural!</li>
      <li>Works great and is soft on my gums, but all the bristles are the same length so it can be a little difficult to keep the bristles in one spot for long.  </li>
      <li>I GENERALLY am a review &amp; research freak and will ONLY purchase something that I&#x27;ve read reviews on</li>
      <li>Our young kids use our old Oral-B toothbrushes, and these heads work extremely well for them.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps we should give them to all kids and teach them how to use at a young age, in the long run it would save us all money and pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Extra soft brushes are not as \\&quot;soft\\&quot; as I would like them to be, but definitely softer than the regular heads.  </li>
      <li>have been using this soft version for so long</li>
      <li>Whether you choose the standard brush or the extra soft will be an individual decision.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I started with sensitive heads instead of regular because my gums were not used to electric toothbrushes and even with these, they still bleed if I hit them at the wrong angle.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the first brush head for a few weeks now</li>
      <li>I was loathe to give up my electric toothbrush, but kept pushing down too much on the brush head.</li>
      <li>Because the brushheads are so gentle, I feared they were not cleaning as well, but to my extreme delight, my teeth are cleaner than ever - and this from one who always gets complimented for my home care by my dental professionals!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend to other sensitive-mouth folks.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it after comparing with other Oral B brush heads models.</li>
      <li>These brush heads typically run about $20 for a set of 3, so the Amazon price of under $11 for a set was a real steal.  </li>
      <li>why are these so costly, and no one is really any less</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t last really long, but I have sensitive teeth</li>
      <li>I have sensitive gums, and I have found that the normal brush heads are a bit too harsh.</li>
      <li>I had several gum areas that were sensitive to the previous Oral-B brush heads I was using, and those areas were marked by my dental hygienist as receding.</li>
      <li>I have a new Oral B electric tooth brush and the brushes that came with the unit were way to stiff for my sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend purchasing one of the Braun Professional Series Electric Tooth Brush systems if you are a as crazy about clean teeth as I am.</li>
      <li>and you can easily clean your entire set of teeth with this brush head unlike some of the larger ones where it&#x27;s hard to get in small areas of your mouth.be certain that it&#x27;s not me</li>
      <li>, the price is a little much, but that&#x27; s how the company makes it&#x27;s money</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel like I am pointlessly allowing the brush to hover aimlessly (which happened with the dual clean because its coverage area was so large that it felt pointless to brush for that long).</li>
      <li>These brush heads are small enough and soft enough to clean the little curves of my teeth without pushing the gums away from the teeth.</li>
      <li>Some honest reviewers do not understand what a product is for or how to use it and will trash a product simply because they are just plain dumb.</li>
      <li>I would have given a 5/5 if the sensitive electric brush heads were much closer in price to tandard bristle electric brush heads, and if I had had the oppertunity to have used one for at least 3 months from the time of this review to find out the lifespan of this variety of replacement head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> The heads come 3 to a package, the arrive in good order and while there are &amp;#34;wear&amp;#34; indicators built in to the coloration of the bristles, it is a good practice to change every 30 days.  </li>
<li> Product came promply and in good condition.  </li>
<li> Good price, and quality.</li>
<li> If you find them listed for about $5 per brush head, that&#x27;s a good bargain (I&#x27;ve seen 1-2 sold for $18).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
<li> always good to have the replacement heads on hand.</li>

<li> Genuine Oral B refills - work great</li>
<li> I have always liked Oral-B, but I think I will stick with my return to the toothbrush.</li>
<li> Just a nice product.</li>
<li> wondered if this brush would be effective.  </li>
<li> and my dentist insisted that this would help my receding &amp; inflammed gum issues and assured me that HE did his research and assured me that this IS the absolute best product out there, told me about some testimonials of his customers</li>
<li> Thanks for the great price!!</li>
<li> These replacement heads are effective and don&#x27;t  irritate my mouth.</li>
<li> werent find so for me was really nice to find and also</li>
<li> [I&#x27;ve had both], though they are both effective in removing plaque</li>
<li> And the dentist says it&#x27;s working good to keep my teeth healthier and cleaner :)</li>
<li> They are gentle on gums and teeth while doing an excellent job of cleaning.</li>
<li> Reasonably effective in removing plaque</li>
<li> I would have liked to know what plug type and what power was needed.</li>
<li> Nice price for the brushes.</li>
<li> Nice to not have to worry about trying to find them in the store.  </li>
<li> I decided I needed to buy the products own brand.</li>
<li> The floss type heads are out of the question for a pain-free yet effective brushing.</li>
<li> I would be nice if it had an indicator of the level of charge.  </li>
<li> Easy to use, for the outsanting performance to keep my mouth clean and in excellent conditions.  </li>
<li> Nice brush heads.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive gums or anything, these just seemed like they had the best reviews/satisfaction for a good price.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m pleased to purchase this product at a good price.</li>
<li> Easier to use effectively than a manual brush</li>
<li> This is a nice toothbrush, but wish it had a choice of speed controls.  </li>
<li> Cleans my teeth nicely</li>

<li> I pay more for in the store.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Better than a Sonic</li>
<li> I love using the extra-soft brush heads.</li>
<li> Of course, this would also depend on how often one brushes his/her teeth; the more you brush, the likelihood would be that changing the brush head would occur sooner than every season/three months.</li>
<li> And I love the fact that you don&#x27;t have to do the work of brushing your teeth when the Oral-B toothbrush does it for you.</li>
<li> product speaks for itself, I&#x27;ve been a satisfied user for 8 years</li>

<li> I have zero gum problems and I have healthy teeth.</li>

<li> These are the genuine thing.  </li>
<li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked these so much</li>
<li> you are using a cheap AA battery unit</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used these brush heads for several months now and they do a great job (while still leaving some enamel on my teeth).  </li>
<li> These are gentle on my teeth and gums but effective in cleaning.</li>
<li> Amazon does not have them available now.</li>
<li> When i had moved in with my gf, she had brought along one of those cheap Oral-B Vitality Electric Toothbrushes.</li>
<li> I have used these brushes for several years and they do a great job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
<li> The cheap copies start to wiggle and almost fall apart in your mouth.  </li>
<li> The Oral B round brushes makes my gums Happy!  </li>
<li> They fit snugly as intended.</li>
<li> They fit and they work.  </li>
<li> However, they fit the appliance and do the job that I need.</li>
<li> Comfortable.</li>
<li> if you like your Oral-B electric tooth brush, these same-branded replacement brush heads fit perfectly.&lt;br</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s not as comfortable.</li>
<li> They fit our electric toothbrushes.  </li>
<li> For some reason I haven&#x27;t been able to find the soft brush heads in stores, so I&#x27;m glad I was able to find it here.</li>
<li> I can not say enough great things about these brush heads.</li>
<li> Good on my sensitive teeth.</li>
<li> and it is good by far.</li>
<li> So far so good with these replacements.  </li>
<li> But they are good on sensitive teeth/gums like mine, so I continue to buy them.</li>
<li> So far, so good.</li>
<li> A good price (locally they are with $10 more) for the sake of your oral health.</li>
<li> Really good for sensitive tooth.</li>
<li> Good for sensitive teeth and gums.</li>
<li> I can use it on maximum speed and feel almost nothing, which is good for sensitive gums and teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Good deal  but slow delivery over all happy with purchase.</li>
<li> Turn to good old Amazon</li>
<li> Also good for people with sensitive teeth.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t be penny wise and gums foolish, get the Oral-B Sensitive.</li>
<li> It does a good job with cleaning and soft on the gum.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a good product and it&#x27;s appropriately soft.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Having sensitive teeth limits my oral hygine product choices, so having the option of an electric brush head is good</li>
<li> It is good to change them frequently.  </li>
<li> These are good for people with sensitive teeth too.</li>
<li> Brushes feel good on my Sensitive teeth.</li>
<li> Nice brushes, fit Oral B unit very well.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m very happy with these, so much so, that I bought a second pack.  </li>
<li> They are comfortable -- effective cleaning, yet gentle.  </li>
<li> It is well manufactured, and so far this has been a good product.</li>
<li> I needed these and to buy local was gonna cost me quite a bit more, definitely a good buy on these</li>
<li> These soft brush heads are good for everyone&#x27;s teeth.</li>
<li> and she was right, so I&#x27;m glad they are available here.</li>
<li> In my honest opinion, the sensitive toothbrushes are generally a better way to clean your teeth.</li>
<li> So excited to find them at such a great price.  </li>
<li> I am older and my fingers do not work like they used to, but the overall quality of these brushes is excellent.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m currently pregnant and needed soft bristles since gums are sensitive during pregnancy, these fit the bill perfectly.</li>
<li> They do not bother my sensitive gums at all and my teeth feel nice and clean!</li>
<li> I am a huge fan of powered toothbrushes - my mouth just doesn&#x27;t feel as clean when I use a manual toothbrush.</li>
<li> They fit snugly on my existing Oral-B electric toothbrush and easily clean my teeth to almost dentist-cleaning level..  </li>
<li> There are many manual options nowadays that have very soft fine bristles that clean between the teeth much better.</li>
<li> My son has braces and these work the best and are also easy on his gums while getting into hard to reach areas.  </li>
<li> The product came very fast and was a much better price than at any store in my area.  </li>
<li> I use the Sensitive brush head and the Gentle cycle on my Oral-B Professional 5000 and love the awesome clean feeling.  </li>
<li> so small one with circult form is the best.</li>
<li> I am very pleased with the Oral B-Sensitive Soft Brush Heads.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Amazon: Please check and confirm whether this item is an original part manufactured by Oral-B.</li>
<li> Definitely worth ordering through auto pay and ship!</li>
<li> I originally got the electric toothbrush because my dentist said it might help keep my mouth cleaner, but he cautioned me to get the softest brush heads</li>
<li> These appear to be original Oral-B brushes like they sell in the stores at twice this price.  </li>
<li> I have found that with any toothbrush, that if you hold them under running hot water, it helps to soften them up a bit more.</li>
<li> as usual, Amazon Prime shipping is the best!</li>
<li> It keeps my smile Healthy, feeling good &amp; looking younger  </li>
<li> I am not disappointed.</li>
<li> While it is said that the electric tooth brush doesn&#x27;t get your teeth any cleaner than the old hand brush, they do have the very important advantage of stimulating your gums!</li>
<li> For the first time in my life I love brushing my teeth.  </li>
<li> The only kind I will ever buy !</li>
<li> Beats the medium firmness heads that come with the original purchase of the Braun.  </li>
<li> I was happy to be able to get these brush heads, I haven&#x27;t been able to find them lately.  </li>
<li> I bought these to replace the brush head that came with the electric toothbrush originally.  </li>
<li> Cheaper than the stores, it&#x27;s an original Oral-B</li>
<li> These are original from oral B</li>
<li> The original oral-b.  </li>
<li> This is the brand that my dentist originally recommended, and I have been using it for years and years.</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t say I can even notice a difference from the original head in my Precision Clean...</li>
<li> These replacements fit my electric toothbrush perfectly; however, I still feel that the bristles are too hard.</li>
<li> My mouth still gets very clean and yet it is very gentle on my gums.</li>
<li> My dentist confirmed that although I was getting my teeth and gums clean, also due to good flossing, my gums were doing better with the electric toothbrush</li>
<li> The three pack is handy to have in the lavatory draw when a new brush is needed.</li>
<li> done leaving your teeth feeling clean and polished as they should.</li>
<li> so I HAVE to have things clean or it grosses me out.  </li>
<li> The electric toothbrush gets your mouth clean.</li>
<li> These clean just as well</li>
<li> I read excellent reviews for Oral-B  and have always used extra soft tooth brushes.  </li>
<li> clean but save the enamel.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Since I started using these compact heads, my dentist tells me that I have exceptionally clean teeth.  </li>
<li> Teeth feel all clean n stuff</li>
<li> My teeth feel totally clean when I do that.</li>
<li> yet I feel like a have clean teeth.</li>
<li> Need these to clean under bonded wire</li>
<li> They clean your teeth well, without causing bleeding or discomfort.</li>
<li> My teeth feel clean and shining.  </li>
<li> My teeth feel so clean after brushing.  </li>
<li> The teeth are clean but the gums started to recede.</li>
<li> I still use a manual brush for my tongue but can get it almost as clean as with the Oral B.</li>
<li> My teeth feel really clean.</li>
<li> My teeth are so damn clean</li>
<li> Brush heads provide a dentist clean feeling every time.  </li>
<li> They clean throughly without abraison.</li>
<li> but it would be much better if more stores carried soft bristled brushes</li>
<li> They interchange for the type clean wanted.  </li>
<li> Clean teeth and gums</li>
<li> These keep my teeth clean without hurting.</li>
<li> No problems, clean teeth</li>
<li> and you can tell that the vibrations are no long as good as they should be.</li>
<li> We switched from the Floss Action brush heads to these and are so glad we did!  </li>
<li> but the heads had gotten pretty worn out - these made it good as new again.</li>
<li> , I brush 2-3 times per day, floss, clean my tongue, take showers every day, my bathroom is not musty - it&#x27;s clean &amp; smells good, my home is clean - in fact I&#x27;m actually somewhat of a germaphobe</li>
<li> They are very gentle on your teeth&#x27;s enamel but not sacrificing getting them squeaky clean!</li>
<li> This is the most reasonably priced place to find original replacement heads.  </li>
<li> What a difference this automatic toothbrush has made on my special needs son&#x27;s teeth.  </li>
<li> There is nothing really special about this purchase to comment on.</li>
<li> the right size I was looking for!</li>
<li> particular type of brush head supplied with that set, proved to be most comfortable.</li>
<li> Softer than the regular brush heads, but still clean as just good.</li>
<li> Best one, hard to get in stores now.</li>
<li> These extra soft brush heads are perfect and they are hard to find in the store; so ordering a years worth at time is wonderful</li>
<li> It is not ridiculously soft and seems perfect for a sensitive mouth.&lt;br</li>
<li> Product as expected, happy with it all.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing</li>
<li> I have sensitive teeth and these heads are amazing.  </li>
<li> The head moves in a spinning motion but does not make a full 360</li>
<li> I used another highly-rated electric toothbrush for three years and never had as good a dental checkup as this last one.</li>
<li> These fit the electric brush I bought years ago but rarely used before.</li>
<li> They are soft and effective  </li>
<li> I never liked to change the brush heads on my Oral B toothbrush until I found out about this awesome product.</li>
<li> This is my absolute favorite toothbrush.  </li>
<li> they last quite awhile, do a good job, and don&#x27;t pull apart.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have full blown recession or temperature sensitivity - thank goodness, but I tend to stress about it anyway.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been buying these brushes for some time now and never could find them for a good price locally.</li>
<li> Brushes are nice and soft, which have not irritated my gums.</li>
<li> The brushes do a nice job of cleaning my sensitive teeth with no problems noted.</li>
<li> Almost a full $10 cheaper on Amazon.</li>
<li> The heads are much more gentle on teeth and gums</li>
<li> I also appreciated the subscription which I signed-up for as there was a coupon that was automatically applied to my order resulting in a much better price.</li>
<li> It feels nice and soft against teeth &amp; gums.</li>
<li> These brushes are nice and sensitive...</li>
<li> It is also more gentle on my gum.</li>
<li> Now this brush seems to really remove all that as I concentrate the brush more to my gumline.  </li>
<li> ; BRUSH (TRIED ANOTHER THAT CAME WITH THE TOOTHBRUSH) AND THE SENSITVE BRUSH IS SOOO MUCH MORE GENTLE TO MY TEETH AND MOUTH.</li>
<li> We were taught that straight, soft toothbrushes like the old Oral-B 40&#x27;s were best.</li>
<li> these were WAY cheaper then the ones at my local store, they work well and are good for my teeth</li>
<li> I should have paid more attention to the user ratings and spent more money on a better toothbrush.</li>
<li> I could never do a good job of cleaning his teeth with a regular tooth brush.  </li>
<li> I recommend everyone who wants to take better care of their teeth to try it.</li>
<li> Good quality and, thankfully, only have to order one style replacement part of the attachment set for Waterpik.</li>
<li> thanks Oral B :)</li>
<li> My teeth love this product and it is gentle on my gums.</li>
<li> and it makes me mouth feel super clean.  </li>
<li> Much more gentle on my aging teeth and gums.</li>
<li> but the bristles feel dense enough to do a really good job.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m just learning about battery-operated toothbrushes, and I have sensitive teeth, so I am happy to use these brush heads with my new Oral-B toothbrush.  </li>
<li> These work very well, good for sensitive gums, but clean well.</li>
<li> They fit the Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision OralB</li>
<li> Apparently, the comment requires six more words!</li>
<li> So the original brand is definitely worth it for me.</li>
<li> While a manual toothbrush is fine to use - appreciate the consistent pressure that a brush head provides.  </li>
<li> and they are super to this point.</li>
<li> I plan to order more and like the fact that soft brush heads are available.</li>
<li> Shipped quickly.</li>
<li> The speed it cleans the teeth is super.</li>

<li> , it&#x27;s very easy and uncomplicated to use, the charge on the toothbrush portion holds for a long time, these toothbrushes are really comfortable, stay on just fine</li>
<li> Got so excited when I saw the price of this product that ordered it right away, but so frustared when I tried it.</li>
<li> fits right on and works like original OEM replacement.  </li>
<li> Very good cleaning with these yet gentle enough not to irritate my very tender gums.</li>
<li> These are very soft and cleans pretty nicely.</li>
<li> provide the right amount of firmness to clean my teeth, but not &amp;#34;stress&amp;#34; my gums.</li>
<li> I have very sensitive gums and Oral-B Extra Soft Brush feels light as a feather going across my gums no matter the pressure and yet cleans my teeth wonderfully.  </li>
<li> Yeah exactly, thats why I go with the genuine oral-b heads.</li>
<li> If your gums are more normal, you might not need these brush heads.  </li>
<li> The replacement brush heads fit exactly as described.</li>
<li> I bought these after finding the standard brush heads a bit &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34; and am very pleased with the purchased.</li>
<li> I need softer toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;This is better than the normal ones.&lt;br</li>
<li> These are perfect for getting my teeth super clean without making my gums worse.  </li>
<li> I bought the Oral_B Professional Healthy Clean Precision electric toothbrush and these heads.  </li>
<li> Great job and don&#x27;t wear down your gums.</li>
<li> Comfortable and clean very well even though they are extra-soft.  </li>
<li> These are just replacement brush heads - nothing special about them - but they&#x27;re the right ones and convenient to buy from Amazon.</li>
<li> I was happy to find them here for 50% less and on Subscribe &amp; Save too.  </li>
<li> This were exactly what I expected and were cheaper too than what I saw in the stores, a great deal</li>

<li> The bush is very gentle on the gum line and still keep my teeth clean.</li>
<li> -- that is a first for me!  </li>
<li> So glad to find sensitive replacement heads!</li>
<li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
<li> Once I got them in the mail, I immediately brushed my teeth and was so glad I bought them!</li>
<li> It not only provides new brushes but is a great reminder to change in a timely manner.</li>
<li> The brushhead is very soft, good for sensitive gum.</li>
<li> it was shipped right away and arrived quickly, despite it being during the Christmas rush.</li>
<li> Fast shipping and fine quality</li>
<li> I chose the gentle brush which works fine for me.</li>
<li> I found here a little cheaper price, but quality is good and accurately described.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> The Oral-B is a good interim toothbrush, but with even the lightest &amp;#34;mis-use&amp;#34; one can wear down gum tissue in the process of trying to clean thoroughly.</li>
<li> The Oral-B&#x27;s design is more flush - flat if you will so gunk can easily get in so you have to rinse it out thoroughly after each use.&lt;br</li>
<li> The Oral-B&#x27;s design is more flush - flat if you will so gunk can easily get in so you have to rinse it out thoroughly after each use.    </li>
<li> I have even, on occasion, used these heads on an uncharged handle and that&#x27;s really when I notice that the power really does make a huge difference!</li>
<li> Great for everyday use.</li>
<li> Oral-B is my favorite electric toothbrush and the sensitive heads make it easier to tolerate for someone who has more sensitive teeth.</li>
<li> and they fit my type which is the cheap one it says oral b and braun on it and is a basic charging stand with light</li>
<li> They&#x27;re a bit pricey but worth it.</li>
<li> Much more comfortable that the regular brush heads.</li>
<li> But they do seem to be worth it.  </li>
<li> I prefer the soft headed bristles because they are more dense in packing.</li>
<li> Better than any soft bristle on the market.</li>
<li> They not only priced the item most cost effectively, but I truly appreciated the $2.99 S&amp;H for my whole shipment.</li>
<li> It is worth the price.  </li>
<li> so you have to purchase more frequently.  </li>
<li> It would be nice to have something that could pop on the brush head especially when</li>
<li> but now my teeth are even more sensitive in areas than before.</li>
<li> Well worth the price for the multipack.</li>
<li> These toothbrush heads are being sold for much more than the soft bristle heads</li>
<li> I have sensitive gums and am so glad I bought these extras.  </li>
<li> These were definitely worth the money.</li>
<li> Since I changed to the Sensitive type, my dental checkups have gone much better</li>
<li> so I thought maybe switching to the sensitive head would be better for my gums.</li>
<li> I got this soft toothbrush because I was hoping it would do a better job of cleaning my teeth, and getting into the nooks and crannies.</li>
<li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if these were going to be too soft but that has not been the case.</li>
<li> you have no problems with gums, it&#x27;s better for you to buy Floss Action or Prowhite.</li>
<li> It cleans well and leaves my mouth feeling fresh.  </li>
<li> The extra soft is great for gums.</li>
<li> They are soft enough to win my dentist&#x27;s approval and not tear apart my gums.</li>
<li> The Brush heads are soft but not to soft they do a good job cleaning your teeth and add Sensodyne tooth paste</li>
<li> you have a winning combination for sensitive teeth .</li>
<li> Very much worth the price</li>
<li> Buying the name-brand is really worth it.  </li>
<li> Ended up trying the Oral-B toothbrush, with this extra soft brush head, and it works great.  </li>
<li> Great toothbrush, especially if you have sensitive gums.</li>
<li> well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> If you have an Oral-B brush, use the name brand, its worth it.</li>
<li> My mouth always feels so fresh after I brush with this head,</li>
<li> well worth getting these if you have sesitive teeth or gums.</li>
<li> There isn&#x27;t much exciting to say about these replacement toothbrush heads.  </li>
<li> We love this sensitive head for the Oral-B brush.  </li>
<li> as expected, good price.</li>
<li> I ran out of my replaceable brushes for my Oral B brush so I ordered Oral B sensitive (3 pack) more.  </li>
<li> Love these soft bristles.</li>
<li> My husband need a soft toothbrush and was glad to find it here.</li>
<li> I think they are meant more for people with sensitive gums not teeth.</li>
<li> So I&#x27;m sticking to the Oral-B brand, and I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve accidently discovered the brushes for sensitive teeth,</li>
<li> It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m glad I ordered these soft bristled brushes as I would imagine</li>
<li> I love these soft tooth brushes by oral -b  </li>
<li> Have to use extra soft manual toothbrushes so was very glad to find these as I love to use an electric toothbrush but didn&#x27;t want to risk injuring my gums more by continuing to use regular heads.</li>
<li> Work well for a good cleaning with the Oral-B Professional Deep Clean Brush.  </li>
<li> Exactly as described with quick delivery.</li>
<li> Good price vs. other places.</li>
<li> These brushes appear to be the real deal and work just like the original brushes.</li>
<li> They are much softer then that original brush.</li>
<li> The brushes came on time, in good shape and are working out extremely well.  </li>
<li> These type of bristles are great for scrubbing stubborn particles, but not really that great for everyday cleaning of teeth especially when you use toothpaste that has fine abrasive particles.</li>
<li> This, extra-soft brush are right for me.</li>
<li> (so I may have additional feedback after some time), but right now I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.  </li>
<li> But when it came, it wasn&#x27;t the right thing.  </li>
<li> They&#x27;re just right for me.</li>
<li> , just right.</li>
<li> These are just the right size.</li>
<li> His advice plus brushing after every meal and at bedtime was right on.  </li>
<li> Try getting them from Amazon and see if I am right.</li>
<li> The price is right for my budget.</li>
<li> With the new sensitive brush heads, we are all more comfortable now.</li>
<li> my teeth really feel clean.</li>
<li> As good as expected ;)</li>
<li> and so they get four stars, but you&#x27;ll need to frequently clean the whole system.</li>
<li> They clean thoroughly but gently.  </li>
<li> We loves Oral B, so this a purchase we use to buy, easy and very soft.</li>
<li> I anticipate having to change these more often than the regular ones, since the bristles are more soft, but it is worth the comfort.</li>
<li> Sonicare is a better cleaning machine, but if your mouth is pretty clean already, or have sensitive gums, this brush works very well, and is very gentle.</li>
<li> His gums are in such good shape now that his new hygientist cannot believe he ever was sent to a periodontist.</li>
<li> it feels better on my teeth, more like brushing and a lot less like a mechanical device</li>
<li> /&gt;The brushes which came from this vendor are exactly what you would expect: they are a decent price and they work fine</li>
<li> The heads which came with the new Oral B electric are like concrete, so we doubly appreciated these great soft heads.  </li>
<li> While I have not used any of these brush heads, they are like the one which came on my new Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000 rechargeable electric unit.</li>
<li> I switched from the regular Oral-B brush head to this Extra Soft Brush head with wonderful results.&lt;br /&gt;Dentist asked us to focus the brush on the teeth</li>
<li> I find this brush to be far more comfortable to use than the standard Oral-B brush head -- no gum irritation at all, but it still gets my teeth feeling clean.  </li>
<li> I have sensitive teeth (as do many of us of a certain age), and I find I&#x27;m not as thorough in brushing as I need to be.  </li>
<li> Not much to say other than these work great and are usually a much better price than in the store.</li>
<li> I use this Oral-B toothbrush [[ASIN:B002HWS9GG Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Floss Action Precision 5000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush(packaging may vary)]] , and this brush head fits</li>
<li> These brush heads provide safe, thorough, gentle cleaning for sensitive teeth and gums.  </li>
<li> The soft brushes are better for dental care and really work for me.</li>
<li> Love these Sensitive tooth brush tips, I have been using them for years, the dental hygienist is always surprised how clean my teeth are.</li>
<li> They no longer have white patches and really look nice.  </li>
<li> we go through them so quick very pricey.</li>
<li> Soft brisles on the brush and easy to use.</li>
<li> Much easier on my gums than the regular kind.</li>
<li> Happy checkups with regular daily use combined with flossing and a fluoride rinse.</li>
<li> Holds charge well, keeps teeth clean, is easy to use, and it can use various interchangeable brush heads.</li>
<li> These fit our Oral-B electric toothbrushes; I think we have 3 different ones and they fit them all.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m no dental professional, but I do think that high abrasiveness isn&#x27;t the best thing for teeth or gums, so I think that the Extra Sensitive heads give my teeth &amp; gums the cleaning they need, without adding more opportunity for further erosion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> the package was damaged and looks like so cheap and coming from very old inventory.</li>
<li> I appreciate very much that you have provided me with this product.</li>
<li> The price was very reasonable and it was convenient to order the brushes.  </li>
<li> The brush moves very fast and</li>
<li> so they are very gentle on the gum.</li>
<li> These are very reasonable and works well with my oral b electrical toothbrush.</li>
<li> Very fast shipping.</li>
<li> My husband likes these very much.</li>
<li> I bought the tooth brush years ago for a very reasonable price (like $20).  </li>
<li> It cleans your teeth, is very gentle on the gums</li>
<li> Shipment was very fast from Amazon.  </li>
<li> Very fast</li>
<li> Seller was also great -- speedily shipped the product, and shipping was free though the total was less than $20</li>
<li> I use it every evening and it seems to be clener than a brush and softer and more comfortable than the other brushes that came with my unit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> It really does clean your teeth very well.</li>
<li> As we get older (and my husband takes blood thinners) our gums and teeth become more sensitive.  </li>
<li> Works great with Oral-B 4000 which lets you know when you are brushing too hard.</li>
<li> I have very sensitive gums and these are very gentle on them but still get my teeth clean.</li>
<li> Brushing my teeth is so much easier with Oral-B, and the sensitive brush heads are perfect for someone like me who has been warned by dentists not to brush too hard lest I cause damage to my already-slightly-receded gums.</li>
<li> thanks to Amazon for making them available at a price comparable to normal good-quality toothbrush prices ($3-3.50 ea), depending on the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> thanks to Amazon for making them available at a price comparable to normal good-quality toothbrush prices ($3-3.50 ea), depending on the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> More gentle that the floss action one and cleans very well.</li>
<li> Got genuine ones from Amazon, so far they seem like that.</li>
<li> JUST BACK FOR MORE.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s exactly what i needed for my Oral-B toothbrush.</li>
<li> and sure enough, it&#x27;s not me!</li>
<li> I SHOULD be able to use it until the blue indicator bristles tell me that I need to change it and not any sooner.  </li>
<li> and sure enough, it&#x27;s not me!</li>
<li> , I want to simply rinse the brush &amp; handle after each use and store it away like I&#x27;m supposed to be able to do.  </li>
<li> I SHOULD be able to use it until the blue indicator bristles tell me that I need to change it and not any sooner.   </li>
<li> I have a an electric tooth brush, I needed some brush heads, and this order  was exactly what I needed to do the job![[ASIN:</li>
<li> The first shipment is sort (3) brushes, I sent an email to request.</li>
<li> and although I probably could have found locally, this was much more convenient</li>
<li> When I searched for replacement heads for the Oral-B CrossAction Power, this is the product that came up first.</li>
<li> At first I was hesitant to use a power toothbrush.  </li>
<li> Thanks!</li>
<li> I am a first time user but product meets my expectations.  </li>
<li> , Thank you so much!</li>
<li> would not recommend these for anyone except a brand-new power brush user (for the first brush, while your gums get used to power brushing).  </li>
<li> They also cost a bit more, but in my opinion you get extra use out of them.</li>
<li> (If you&#x27;re interested, the company is called Recycline / Preserve.</li>
<li> But, I can only keep so many.</li>
<li> But, I can only keep so many.</li>
<li> Most people get waaaayyy to abrasive with the standard oral-b electric brushes.</li>
<li> In the future I will be purchasing the drug store brand of these brushes which will be much more cost effecrive.</li>
<li> It was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
<li> I love the oral B When I am using it regularly and then use a manual tooth brush</li>
<li> Will purchase more in the future.</li>
<li> Thanks!</li>
<li> I got them for my kid&#x27;s first electric brush.</li>
<li> The only thing I wish they did was offer more colors to help us distinguish between the brushes.</li>
<li> My wife needs soft toothbrushes and these fit the bill.  </li>
<li> exactly what I need.</li>
<li> but I wish they would hold up better and last longer.</li>
<li> AT ALL AND MORE LIKE A REGULAR TOOTHBRUSH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> They work really well, but I wish they were cheaper!  </li>
<li> /&gt;These aren&#x27;t as soft as they make them sound.  </li>
<li> I bought my first electric toothbrush months ago</li>
<li> &amp; when I got these I really appreciated their solidness!</li>
<li> I love how the timer helps you figure out when to move to the next section of teeth.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll submit more info later,</li>
<li> I go to my dentist later this month, so will also be interesting to see if they notice any changes after a month of use.</li>
<li> These heads are very well made!</li>
<li> I will definitely buy more.  </li>
<li> They are comfortable on my sensitive teeth and gums.</li>
<li> Exactly what they say they are.  </li>
<li> $27 I paid for 6 was  only 4 dollars more than for 3 Oral B brushes at drug  store.</li>
<li> This was one of my first experiences with a product like this</li>
<li> This generation of e toothbrush is significantly better than the last Oral B.  </li>
<li> Definitely will get some more as needed.</li>
<li> Dont get fooled by the cheap offers on groupon.  </li>
<li> The product does exactly what it is suppose to do.  </li>
<li> I have used four of the 12 in the first 9 months</li>
<li> I have been buying these for several years and just love them.  </li>
<li> Exactly what I wanted and needed.</li>
<li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
<li> I definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using them for over 6 years, and just love them...</li>
<li> I will be purchasing more as will be needed in the future.</li>
<li> This is the second set I have ordered of these brushes, and I don&#x27;t think I need to say any more.</li>
<li> First off</li>
<li> Fit brush well, just not as soft as I thought it would be.</li>
<li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stocked a lot of these that would probably last me 2 years, that&#x27;s how much I love it.</li>
<li> The pricing is substantially better than what i can find locally.</li>
<li> Has 5 different brushing modes which deffinately makes for an interesting brushing experiance.</li>
<li> Thanks!  </li>
<li> The smaller brush works better because you can angle the brush and get the bristles in between the teeth.</li>
<li> First electric brush, these heads work as described.</li>
<li> These brush heads are very soft but still clean well.</li>
<li> Even then, they seem to clean better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> They both work great but don&#x27;t last very long</li>
<li> My gums easily bleed,  and these soft brushes really help keep my gums from getting sore.  </li>
<li> I was very relieved the brushes fit my tooth brush as it is very old.  </li>
<li> The Oral-B sensitive head is great for getting in and around all the tight spaces in your mouth without tearing up your gums.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t use any other kind.</li>
<li> I liked other heads</li>
<li> I always try to keep them in use as long as is healthy, and when they&#x27;re no longer good for my mouth, I put them to work in my cleaning toolkit, for scrubbing other things (great for behind faucets, some jewelry, the toothbrush itself, etc.)</li>
<li> I always try to keep them in use as long as is healthy, and when they&#x27;re no longer good for my mouth, I put them to work in my cleaning toolkit, for scrubbing other things (great for behind faucets, some jewelry, the toothbrush itself, etc.)</li>
<li> They are not too hard on the gums or teeth and most importantly they clean very well.</li>
<li> I have a receding gum line and therefore am very careful about what kind of toothbrush and toothbrush head I used.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve ordered these Oral B heads for a few years now, and they&#x27;re great for my sensitive teeth.  </li>
<li> They are soft and by using an electric toothbrush I can hold the brush head against the tooth itself, avoiding the gum line, let the vibrating bristles get my teeth sparkling clean and keep my gums healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The bristles are soft and pliable yet seem to clean well.  </li>
<li> Our dentist recommends only SENSITIVE oral B (or any kind) tooth-brush heads, or tooth brushes.  </li>
<li> Love the soft sensitive bristles.</li>
<li> Oral B Power Sensitive replacement electric toothbrushes are the only ones of their kind I use.</li>
<li> inner bristles though are medium, so you have to make sure you don&#x27;t apply too much pressure to prevent the medium bristles from hitting your gum line.</li>
<li> The after-market heads I&#x27;ve tried don&#x27;t fit quite as well and for me, the extra cost is worth it.</li>
<li> These heads certainly deliver on that front, I have used them ever since and will always keep some handy, dont think i have found any other tooth brush that works for me as well with these heads.</li>
<li> my gums bleed, they never bleed and that right there told me enough and confirmed with my dentist</li>
<li> It&#x27;s nice to be able purchase these from Amazon and not pay a ridiculous price!</li>
<li> The Brush heads arrived quickly , they where at a much lower price than the local discount store and they where original Oral-B brushes .What else</li>
<li> I rated it a 4 rather than a 5 because there may be other heads that work even better, but I&#x27;ve been using the same model for years &amp; it does a really good job of cleaning your teeth, partly because it utilizes a timer to let you know when two minutes are up, which makes it more likely that you won&#x27;t do just a cursory brushing as we all tend to do with a standard brush.  </li>
<li> Good quality brush heads below the price usually found at drug and grocery stores etc.</li>
<li> /&gt;Selected this one based on other reviews and was surprised by how good it was.</li>
<li> this particular form like more because three pieces for replace is the one that we regular find in the market but</li>
<li> The bristles are falling out very quickly, much more quickly than on previous orders.  </li>
<li> They clean well, but are gentle on sensitive gums.</li>
<li> These gentle brush heads get my teeth clean without aggravating the sensitive area at the gumline.</li>
<li> My local stores, including the big box stores, usually have these available, but Amazon had a better price and, by bundling, I was able to have free shipping.</li>
<li> These clean your teeth ten times better and faster than any regular tooth brush ever will.</li>
<li> Super soft replacement heads.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure why these aren&#x27;t more widely available, but they are great.&lt;br</li>
<li> Strong enough to get your teeth and gums clean, but sensitive enough to provide a comfortable brushing experience.</li>
<li> They had a strong vibration to them that actually hurt my teeth and gums and were a lot noisier.</li>
<li> while brushing then certainly a mixture of that &amp; water runs over the handle area and if not everytime you brush then SOMETIMES some of the gunk gets</li>
<li> and I try to be certain that none of that residue is neither on the electric toothbrush handle portion (where the brush sticks &amp; on the bottom where you place the charger) AND</li>
<li> Fiber construction that reaches in-between teeth instead of the large nubbies.</li>
<li> I bought three extra packages of these brushes to go with the Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean &amp; Floss Action Precision 5000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush.  </li>
<li> After too many years of orthodontic correction, I have developed a sensitivity to regular toothbrushes (even those deemed &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;).</li>
<li> As an older adult, I find the extra soft to be more comfortable on my gums.</li>
<li> Unlike some, they fit my toothbrush fine, but the sound the motor started making indicated that it was working very hard.</li>
<li> Highly recommended for sensitive teeth, gets all teeth clean, would buy again.</li>
<li> The product finally received was fine.</li>
<li> sensitive bristles are extremely soft and also fine.</li>
<li> much to add for simple brush heads, correct brand and all fine.</li>
<li> you can give your mouth a good scrubbing without doing damage from hard bristles.  </li>
<li> Good price for hard to find item delivered to your home.</li>
<li> I recommend them very highly and they are so reasonable in price.</li>
<li> Very happy with this item; had hard time finding the sensitive ones in my local stores.</li>
<li> After spending some time looking at them and the various sites that describe the differences between the real and the fakes brushes I concluded that the ones I got are genuine.</li>
<li> They fit on the toothbrush much easier than generic heads that I bought at a store.</li>
<li> In short, I was really happy when these arrived in the mail a few days after ordering.  </li>
<li> The whole family seem to be liking them.</li>
<li> thanks</li>
<li> Still, much easier on the teeth and gets the job</li>
<li> We really like them, though.</li>
<li> What more can you say about a product that does what you expected?</li>
<li> This really out cleans either of those, you will feel the difference when you run your tongue over your teeth.  </li>
<li> gums seem much healthier.</li>
<li> Shipping was fast and efficient.</li>
<li> These work very well.  </li>
<li> Genuine product from German.</li>
<li> Anyway these work really well</li>
<li> Have not yet been in for a check up but really like them at the moment.</li>
<li> Wish they didn&#x27;t cost so much...</li>
<li> Highly recommended!</li>
<li> Thanks so much.</li>
<li> This is the real thing.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s the real deal and</li>
<li> really good.&lt;br</li>
<li> Also, it gives your gums a break from too much brushing as that can literally brush away your gums.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;d recomend this product to any one who really cares about the condition and looks of their teeth.</li>
<li> and they wear out really fast.</li>
<li> REALLY</li>
<li> Much easier and cheaper to order from Amazon.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s much softer.  </li>
<li> Thanks to lots of coffee and tea</li>
<li> &amp; I do really like their razors)</li>
<li> Gentle, but wish they were recycled &amp; recyclable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many</li>
<li> Gentle, but wish they were recycled &amp; recyclable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many</li>
<li> They are definitely worth the effort to get these sensitive brushes.</li>
<li> This is probably because with electric toothbrushes you don&#x27;t use as much pressure on your teeth.&lt;br</li>
<li> This is the real thing.</li>
<li> Highly recommend!</li>
<li> Much much much cheaper than in the stores.</li>
<li> Fast service</li>
<li> I really like the way that these brushes go around my gums without being abrasive.</li>
<li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a convenient way to buy these things, if you don&#x27;t get out much, I guess.</li>
<li> Fast delivery too.</li>
<li> could buy the whole toothbrush with a brush head on it and an additional brush head for the price of just 3 heads.</li>
<li> I prefer these because they are gentle on the gums.</li>
<li> The extra-soft brush heads are gentle and just what the dentist advised.  </li>
<li> It really helps when you visit your dentist.</li>
<li> These heads fit on a basic oral B electric tooth brush.  </li>
<li> The difference is very noticeable to my hygienist and to me.</li>
<li> They gently brush away the food and tartar on my teeth.</li>
<li> I am a dentist, and I really like this tip for my electric toothbrush.</li>
<li> Much easier to brush with than a manual.</li>
<li> The brush on the unit performs very well, so I anticipate these brush heads will do likewise.</li>
<li> Thanks, Amazon.</li>
<li> Highly recommend!</li>
<li> I really like it as well as a polisher head to keep coffee from staining my teeth.  </li>
<li> Real money saver.</li>
<li> My dentist says to brush my teeth as gently as if i were cleaning a strand of pearls.</li>
<li> Gentle on the gums</li>
<li> How much does it cost to make them?</li>
<li> How much can you say about refills?</li>
<li> They are gentle on the gums.  </li>
<li> Not so reasonable.  </li>
<li> Much easier on my teeth,</li>
<li> fast ship&lt;br /&gt;glad</li>
<li> It cleans well and is gentle on the gums.</li>
<li> Fast shipping.</li>
<li> Own both a sonicare essence and the oral B. Overall cheaper than the sonicare and the rotating heads give me at least the illusion that it cleans better, however, cleaning the head is an issue as the hole in the front below the head is a bacteria trap.</li>
<li> All my local stores quit carrying the extra soft toothbrush heads which are great for sensitive teeth.</li>
<li> It works really well.  </li>
<li> Sold and recommended by my very finicky dentist.</li>
<li> They fit my Braun powered toothbrush--Braun and Oral-B are owned by the same company.  </li>
<li> Much softer on the gums.  </li>
<li> This is the only brush head that she is comfortable with.</li>
<li> I like this softer brush much better than the harder bristle brushes although I switch off with</li>
<li> The brush heads really hold up to the number of brushings I put them through.  </li>
<li> The bristles also get between your teeth very well.  </li>
<li> I was expecting a much softer bristle</li>
<li> This is working very well.</li>
<li> I was about to through the whole thing away.</li>
<li> Does its job and is really gentle on teeth and gums.</li>
<li> Very sturdy and really brushes well.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t know brushing my teeth could be this comfortable and still get the job done properly.  </li>
<li> The rotating part is taller, narrower, and much softer than the floss-action--</li>
<li> All toothbrushes should be this gentle.</li>
<li> Also much cheaper to purchase online.</li>
<li> My hygienist really sees the difference with these.</li>
<li> This is the real deal.</li>
<li> But these really have made all the difference.  </li>
<li> I highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
<li> have always had oral b  toothbrushes &amp; intensely dislike this one - for the ist time.</li>
<li> softer bristles are gentle on the gumline and reduce wear on exposed roots&lt;</li>
<li> thanks Amazon..</li>
<li> They are gentle on enamel, but get the job done.</li>
<li> It works very well---it is a keeper</li>
<li> I like them better than the standard &#x27;Professional Precision&#x27; brush from Oral-B.</li>
<li> These heads at least for me, do a good job in getting between the teeth and</li>
<li> but either are far better than using a regular brush.</li>
<li> I like the sensitive toothbrush heads better then the regular ones.</li>
<li> I like them better than the flossing-action and the regular soft brush heads.</li>
<li> In retrospect by saving a few dollars per toothhead I was damaging my gums permanently - something worth more than $5.</li>
<li> THe bristles are soft enough that they don&#x27;t cause any discomfort, but these heads still do an outstanding job of cleaning their teeth.</li>
<li> I love these - they are gentle and not to soft- have extra ones on hand if you brush 3 times a day.</li>
<li> I like the sensitive heads much more than the regular ones.</li>
<li> Overall these are my favorite brush heads because they&#x27;re soft.</li>
<li> keep separate is new for me, here in Latin America first it not common to see, and find first we got the toothbrush</li>
<li> Soft and does not hurt the gums!!!</li>
<li> After buying store brand brush heads labeled ok for my oral B toothbrush, I found they did not fit right.</li>
<li> the brush is very soft, I like it very much.  </li>
<li> Overall, this brush head is more comfortable than any other brush head or tooth brush I have used.</li>
<li> They were brand new, and were exactly what I needed for my Oral-B Toothbrush.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s so easy to use and has lasted  a long time.  </li>
<li> Much softer than the standard brush head that originally came with my toothbrush.</li>
<li> I have sensitive teeth and cannot use any other kind.  </li>
<li> They work fine,not sure what you can really write about a toothbrush head other then that.</li>
<li> My husband is disabled and I brush his teeth for him, and these are nice and soft and have lasted very, very well.  </li>
<li> There isnt too much you can write about when reviewing a toothbrush head; however, i would most definitely recommend this product for those who have sensitive teeth and want something that is strong enough to clean but gentle enough for the sensitive teeth/gums.</li>
<li> I like these brush heads better than some of the other styles for the Oral-B, and, really, they all clean about the same.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Since this was my first electric toothbrush, I couldn&#x27;t compare any former experience and simply didn&#x27;t know any better.  </li>
<li> The are same quality as the ones that originally came with the brush</li>
<li> Although these brush heads are marketed as extra-soft, they also seem to cup my teeth better than the other brush heads.  </li>
<li> I have the other top rated, and got this for my wife.  </li>
<li> I think this is better than the other brand I have.  </li>
<li> No need for the exotic shapes and features of other electric brushes.  </li>
<li> These are a workable, low price alternative to original equipment.</li>
<li> This is softer than many of the other oral-b toothbrush head refills.</li>
<li> I thought they were supposed to be the same as what was originally on my brush, but they weren&#x27;t.  </li>
<li> /&gt;They wear fairly well though not quite as long as the regular soft brushes.  </li>
<li> In typical fashion from Oral-B/Braun these are very good, they could be softer as calling them Extra-Soft is a little bit of a stretch.</li>
<li> They thoroughly clean my teeth, just as the regular brush heads used to do.</li>
<li> My toothbrush has a two-minute timer, which is enough time to thoroughly clean your teeth.</li>
<li> These clean just as well as the regular heads.</li>
<li> Leaves your teeth clean like if you left the dentist office.</li>
<li> It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, massaging your gums, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs.  </li>
<li> My son bought a Sonic to try to keep his orthodontic braces clean and, as it was bought at Costco, came with a second handle.</li>
<li> My teeth never got this clean when I was using my regular toothbrush.  </li>
<li> batteries).The result is my teeth comes out so clean that I will not go back to manual toothbrush again.</li>
<li> I feel that they get my teeth just as clean as the regular ones.  </li>
<li> my main Braun electric toothbrush and these are far superior and worth the extra cost if you need an extra soft brush for sensitive teeth or gums.  </li>
<li> Been using the Oral B Professional electric tooth brush for many years and am always amazed at how long the machine has lasted.  </li>
<li> They are very gentle but still provide a complete cleaning.  </li>
<li> Soft bristles, cleans very gently.</li>
<li> Very gentle on my sensitive teeth.  </li>
<li> Unlike other brands and regular brushes, the Oral-B extra soft is really excellent for sensitive gums.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Super soft for sensitive gums.</li>
<li> Extra soft bristles are easy on the teeth and gums.  </li>
<li> It has been becoming more and more difficult to find them in the stores locally for sensitive teeth.</li>
<li> These are nice replacement heads, but after using these for several years, I have come to realize they are not actually that sensitive when it comes to toothbrush heads.</li>
<li> I like this toothbrush since its much gentler than normal Oral-B toothbrushes.</li>
<li> First time trying out the &#x27;sensitive&#x27; replacements.</li>
<li> I was glad to have found an affordable toothbrush for sensitive teeth and extra soft brush head.</li>
<li> And work pretty well so far.</li>
<li> SO MY MOUTH IS PRETTY SENSITIVE AT TIMES.</li>
<li> These are for sensitive teeth and gums and they are gentle!</li>
<li> This one makes my gum feels good as its soft, but it&#x27;s hard enough to make my teeth clean.</li>
<li> The sensitive heads are so much gentler on my gums!</li>
<li> I love using this Oral-B toothbrush with the sensitive brush heads as my gums can be sensitive to a regular toothbrush.</li>
<li> Does not clean as well as the original brush and wears too quickly</li>
<li> I actually have to change them MUCH more often than normal and wipe down my electric toothbrush handle with peroxide &amp; a clean washcloth (since I didn&#x27;t know where the smell was coming from)</li>
<li> They also lose their color over time, to remind you to toss it and put on a new one!</li>
<li> They are much gentler on my gums and teeth, and seem to do the same effective job as the other Oral-B heads I have tried.</li>
<li> I prefer the sensitive brush head because the bristles are soft and flat across the top.</li>
<li> Better than my previous one.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s impossible to find extra-soft brush-head replacements for my Oral B electric toothbrush, so this was wonderful.  </li>
<li> and I&#x27;ve saved lots of money by being able to have my teeth cleaned less often.</li>
<li> My favorite replacement for my Oral-B Precision Black 7000.</li>
<li> These work well with my older model Oral-B toothbrush</li>
<li> I could because most people essentially brush their gums away with the standard stiffness brushes.  </li>
<li> Decent price, too.</li>
<li> Only place I could find toothbrush to fit for sensitive teeth, thankful I could order them.</li>
<li> Worked for me, decent price.  </li>
<li> price was  about $6 more than Rite Aid  generic brand for same quantity  6 brushes.</li>
<li> Just watch for the sales, because prices can vary tremendously for the same item.</li>
<li> As I have gotten older</li>
<li> This one feels more \\&quot;snug\\&quot; (harder to pull off) than the Floss Action which came with the brush.</li>
<li> I bought a generic replacement awhile ago and had to dump it right after 1 usage as it&#x27;s never the same compared to the original one.</li>
<li> I have very sensitive gums and this product gently cleans and removes plaque.</li>
<li> Very soft and gently on your teeth and gums</li>
<li> week later, when you order from some one that sell for Amazon, your review is working very fast!</li>
<li> Wife was not to keen on the new Oral-B Sensitive at first and said that see would give it a try but didn&#x27;t realy like the bruch head.</li>
<li> I recommend it highly.</li>
<li> Highly recommend.</li>
<li> Highly recommend and will buy again.</li>
<li> I reccomend this product highly.</li>
<li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
<li> then I highly recommend you stop.</li>
<li> These are the one highly recommended by dentists for people with weak/bleeding gums.</li>
<li> can highly  recommend  it.</li>
<li> I highly recommend splurging on these brush heads.</li>
<li> I would highly recommend.</li>
<li> Would recommend it highly.</li>
<li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
<li> I highly recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I rated this product with 5 stars for the high quality of the product.  </li>
<li> but Id highly recommend buying elsewhere</li>
<li> Highly recommended.</li>
<li> I highly recommend them.</li>
<li> Highly recommend.</li>
<li> Highly recommend.</li>
<li> Glad I could save a little through Amazon.</li>
<li> Wal-Mart and Target both charge nearly $27 dollars!!</li>
<li> Still, I find that I have to frequently take the brush head off and clean it with anti-bacterial cloths or it gets caked with gunk - that part of the brush never goes in the mouth, but somehow it still gets gross.</li>
<li> Fantastic if you have more sensitive gums or even just don&#x27;t want to feel like you&#x27;re brushing with a tough brush head.  </li>
<li> Love this replacement brushes and it&#x27;s so much cheaper than Rite Aid and other retailers!!!</li>
<li> Not to the extent that using them is painful, it just makes me wonder which is best.</li>
<li> I really like the soft brushes as they save the enamel on my teeth.  </li>
<li> teeth and the soft brushes are really very helpful.</li>
<li> I really like the soft brush heads.</li>
<li> It came with a much stiffer brush which my mouth did not like, so I purchased these soft bristle heads.  </li>
<li> as clearly they dont care much about Amazon customers.</li>
<li> She like to brush her teeth with this type of heads because its soft and doesn&#x27;t irritate gums that much</li>
<li> These brush heads are soft and gently on my gums.</li>
<li> If your dentist wants you to have a soft toothbrush this can be it.  </li>
<li> I really like how soft the heads are, which will help me in reducing my gum recession.</li>
<li> lightly hold agains teeth and be careful along gum line.  </li>
<li> And for $19.88 plus shipping I would have expected to receive 4 brushes, to fit the 4 slots in my toothbrush holder in the Braun Oral B.</li>
<li> The soft brush don&#x27;t scratch my teeth&#x27;s enamel so much.</li>
<li> I have sensitive gums, especially near the inside front teeth.  </li>
<li> The extra soft is much more gentle than the standard soft.  </li>
<li> I prefer the round style which rotates, over the &amp;#34;up and down&amp;#34; competition electric brush because I feel I have more control.  </li>
<li> and they looked like the authentic replacements but were much cheaper and a small plastic part broke almost immediately.</li>
<li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also worth noting that they don&#x27;t feel much different once on the handle and rotating.</li>
<li> he said trying to use generic on the teeth isn&#x27;t worth it</li>
<li> AND I stick the toothbrush heads through a clean cycle in my dishwasher every week or hot, hot water and let it air dry AND rotate brush heads so each one gets a chance to thoroughly dry.  </li>
<li> While the other ones do a fine job, I prefer these heads.  </li>
<li> Soft but not weak, gets the job done.</li>
<li> Only place I can fine the EXTRA soft brush head at a reasonable price.</li>
<li> Despite the high price, this product has the appearance of a cheap imitation.</li>
<li> these smaller heads work great for small mouths (3 year old and six year old son&#x27;s, so far no cavities)</li>
<li> I have tried several of the other brush heads for this series of electric brushes and this one is, by far, the most gentle brush made for this particular electric brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> But these were the original ones and work as expected on my Oral B 5000 brush handle.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t buy cheap ones from other manufacturers.</li>
<li> The original brush heads that come on the toothbrush was so rough on our gums.</li>
<li> , my  mouth is very tender.. and will bleed  most of the time when I brush my teeth,, but with the new soft brushs no more bleeding.</li>
<li> When these brushes get worn out, I swap them out with a new one</li>
<li> works with the new triumph too.</li>
<li> It is recommended that you change to a new brush head every season.</li>
<li> I have tried the new ones and they hurt my teeth and gums.</li>
<li> I have gum problems and wanted to tried a new toothbrush.</li>
<li> Name brand, new and correct product.</li>
<li> people with sensitive teeth (and honestly anyone because you&#x27;re not supposed to scrub your teeth too hard when you brush)</li>
<li> Like these as unlike the other heads they are super gentle on your teeth.</li>
<li> Using and alternating between both the soft and the Floss Action works very well for me.</li>
<li> I really like that these replacement heads are soft bristles, as I have sensitive teeth.</li>
<li> particularly if you have sensitive teeth</li>
<li> The sensitive head is so much nicer to my gums and teeth than the floss action.</li>
<li> Going back to the official heads made me appreciate how quiet and smooth the brush and handle operated.</li>
<li> The drugstores often carry only their own house brands with just a few national brands.</li>
<li> these are still a big savings from the store price, and they fit snuggly &amp; the brush part doesn&#x27;t wobble like the generic ones did.</li>
<li> The Oral-B sensitive extra soft brush heads are gentle on sensitive teeth and gums and are worth getting.</li>
<li> For me my hygenist has had only good things to say about my gums for the last 4 visits, you can do the math to derive the TYPICAL time period that would be covered by 4 visits.  </li>
<li> Purchased direct from Amazon - brushes appeared genuine Oral B, right down to the high price (nearly double what they were 2 years ago!).  </li>
<li> I have very sensitive teeth</li>
<li> I have very sensitive gums and these</li>
<li> I have very sensitive teeth</li>
<li> I have very sensitive gums that bleed a lot when I brush my teeth.  </li>
<li> Couldn&#x27;t you find a material to use that will provide a very soft bristle without being so expensive?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It does not feel very much softer, if at all, than the regular one.</li>
<li> Very soft.</li>
<li> It is VERY soft.</li>
<li> Highly recommend to those with sensitive teeth or residing gum line.</li>
<li> These heads are very soft on your teeth and gums.  </li>
<li> Very soft brush heads.</li>
<li> Since I had baby teeth, I&#x27;ve had very sensitive gums.</li>
<li> My gums are very sensitive</li>
<li> Very soft bristles.</li>
<li> none come with the product curious to see how long they last so far so good</li>
<li> It&#x27;s really soft for my sensitive teeth!!</li>
<li> The regular head is rough on my gums; the sensitive cleans as well or better and is easier on the gums.</li>
<li> Beware the \\&quot;generic\\&quot; replacement heads which look alike, but are usually priced lower and offer more heads for a given price.</li>
<li> Whenever I have, due to necessity, used the standard, non-sensitive heads, I have noticed that they seem to be much more abrasive on my gums.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t use anything except a soft bristled brush!</li>
<li> it&#x27;s a pretty big difference.</li>
<li> What ever I do, it will be with my Oral B electric tooth brush and the Oral B Sensitive head!</li>
<li> They work fine if slightly upright, but that&#x27;s impractical as you try to brush your teeth.</li>
<li> the key word is SENSITIVE, as one can use them freely to massage the gums without causing any inflammation and you can actually push the bristles between your teeth without damaging your gums.</li>
<li> These are the exact heads I need, but couldn&#x27;t find in the local stores.  </li>
<li> Like these very well because not rough on gums in use.</li>
<li> They remind me of a quote from the first three-blade razor commercial - \\&quot;Because you&#x27;ll buy</li>
<li> The bristles are soft on teeth and gums and for people who have tender gums that is a must have!</li>
<li> I have sensitive teeth and these don&#x27;t bother me one bit!  </li>
<li> I bit too soft!</li>
<li> I like it more than the other regular one.</li>
<li> These work well on my sensitive teeth!</li>
<li> Took some getting used to at first, since I was used to the regular manual toothbrush.  </li>
<li> Delivery is quick, right to our door, the globe is small.</li>
<li> Second I did not feel my teeth were clean enough and soon after felt I needed to brush them again.</li>
<li> My favourite ever, keeps teeth clean while maintaining gum&#x27;s health with no harm done to as in the case of other brush</li>
<li> They clean my teeth extremely well.  </li>
<li> This product fits and brushes the way my original heads did, and while I am sad I wasted $20.00 on the store brand, I am happy I invested the additional sum for these brushes.</li>
<li> Brushes are soft and leave your teeth feeling brand new.</li>
<li> These replacement toothbrush heads fit my toothbrush and last a long time.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years and it is easy on my teeth</li>
<li> I think I&#x27;m an average brusher (twice or more daily)</li>
<li> The toothbrush handle itself is over a decade old, has been in use twice daily since its purchase, and seems to work as well as when I first got it.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive gums, but my dentist has told me I am at a higher risk of receding gums, so I thought these might help prevent further deterioration.  </li>
<li> I bought this soft toothbrush  head because my teeth is getting very sensitive.</li>
<li> This tip is very soft, it doesn&#x27;t hurt sensitive gum.</li>
<li> glad that Oral B makes soft tips because dentist said that normal head was being too hard on my gums and leading to sensitivity.</li>
<li> I tried the others like the normal one (one that comes for free), prowhite and floss action replacements but they were all too harsh.</li>
<li> Our set was full of pink!</li>
<li> perfect, impossible to find locally.</li>
<li> no enamel abrasions, still keeps them super white, removing or preventing coffee, tea and red wine stains,</li>
<li> I do not know if they will last as long as the original ones that came with the Oral B toothbrush.</li>
<li> That little oval shaped cavity at the bottom of the brush somehow gets filled with red mold very quickly and because it leads to the inner working of the brush head the inside gets gross too.</li>
<li> : On several occasions, I swapped to a manual toothbrush to be certain that it&#x27;s not me</li>
<li> IT IS NOT STIFF</li>
<li> The extra-soft variety of these brush heads is impossible to find on the shelf at local stores, so I was glad to find it online at such a good price.</li>
<li> These brush heads are easier on my sensitive gums than regular toothbrushes and brush heads that I have tried, even the super soft regular toothbrushes.  </li>
<li> Just be sure to rinse before putting back in the holder or the inside gets a little goopy.</li>
<li> Like these, they are easier on the gums and I can apply a little more pressure, I feel like with the extra pressure</li>
<li> These heads are softer and cause less gum irritation that the original brush heads.  </li>
<li> I love it, it allows me to thoroughly brush without worrying about brushing too hard</li>
<li> Oral B brush heads are getting hard to find in my area, so I was glad to find them on Amazon.</li>
<li> We love these sensitive toothbrush heads and find it hard to purchase anywhere else.  </li>
<li> I much prefer the floss action ones and will order those next time.</li>
<li> I REALLY NEED THE EXTRA SOFT.</li>
<li> However, upon receipt, the package clearly states:</li>
<li> This brush is less abrasive than the Precision Clean brush.  </li>
<li> I use the Oral-B Sensitive Replacement brushes because they are much softer on the gums versus the standard replacement brush.  </li>
<li> I really like them so far and plan to continue using only these.</li>
<li> but....they are worth it and to buy them elsewhere, it&#x27;s gonna be MORE expensive</li>
<li> Asking speaking with my dentist and they recommending the Oral-B Professional Precision 5000, I found that I needed a much softer brush head than the ones that comes standard.</li>
<li> The extra soft heads are my favourite as they are gentle to my gums.</li>
<li> At least in my case, many years of use of these heads has not resulted in any noticeable damage compared to what the old handheld toothbrushes did to me.</li>
<li> Her tip for me was to gently MASSAGE  my gums after brushing, she indicated to me that I should only do this with a SOFT bristle, FOR ME this has worked out well, you milage may vary</li>
<li> So, I guess the sensitive heads are at least subconsciously better.</li>
<li> Not sold on the shaft design, but the bristles are gentle enough.</li>
<li> The bristles are way to soft.</li>
<li> in ordering the sensitive brush my dental doctor recommended the softest I can purchase to reduce gum problems.</li>
<li> They are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive teeth and gums.</li>
<li> These soft brush heads are just what i needed.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m an aggressive brusher (which is why I want a soft brush--I wear away my enamel).  </li>
<li> If you have sensitive teeth and require a truly soft brush, or if you plan to use this brush for children, I couldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using my Oral-B Professional Care electric toothbrush set with these Oral-B Sensitive brush heads for over 4yrs now.  </li>

<li> This head has plenty of massage action though.</li>

<li> Recommend to anyone with sensitive teeth who uses an electric toothbrush</li>
<li> The bristles are soft on this brush, and they spin in circular action.  </li>
<li> However, I don&#x27;t think the brush is as soft as described.</li>
<li> I have sensitive teeth</li>
<li> so I prefer the soft brushes rather than something else.  </li>
<li> The soft bristles allow me to work them in between the teeth without damaging the soft tissues.</li>
<li> She had purchased a three pack of the floss action heads, so i decided to use it to keep up with my teeth hygiene.</li>
<li> Well let me just say that that experience was well learned and a lesson that i learned that i needed a sensitive tooth brush head.</li>
<li> I am a young guy, but i am just so blessed with sensitive teeth.</li>
<li> Wow what a difference between this and the floss action, as well as just a manual toothbrush.</li>
<li> My husband has sensitive gums and loves these.  </li>

<li> I have sensitive gums</li>
<li> Sensitive teeth are not causing discomfort now.  </li>
<li> i Love the soft smaller round heads for my sensitive gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> We don&#x27;t like the larger brushes as much.</li>
<li> And I find the 30 second timer and pressure sensor to be very helpful.  </li>
<li> The OEM are much better/softer than the generic ones.</li>
<li> The brush is so soft on my teeth and gums.</li>
<li> I would not recommend it for someone who has sensitive gums, or is prone to mouth sores.  </li>

<li> Oral-B Sensitive, extra-soft is what my dentist recommends.</li>
<li> Like these...Oral-B Sensitive (3 Extra-Soft Brush heads)...</li>
<li> Needed soft ones - found them here as NA at stores.  </li>
<li> Oral-B Sensitive (3 Extra-Soft Brush heads)</li>
<li> I bought them specifically for my young daughter.</li>
<li> so I use these even though I do not have sensitive teeth.</li>
<li> Switched to the sensitive heads after my dentist said the flossing heads are too aggressive on my gums.  </li>
<li> The soft brush heads are gentler on your gums and enamel.  </li>

<li> With this, now i have all the brush heads for my oral B professional electric toothbrush.</li>
<li> old--</li>
<li> My head must of been 4 years old -</li>
<li> These genuine Oral-B brush is not that expensive ($3-4/each), but more quiet and stable.</li>
<li> No complaints so far</li>
<li> too soft for mei like the othrs</li>
<li> bettertheuy are usable thoughjust too soft for meby</li>
<li> I have sensitive teeth and these brushes are just what the dentist ordered.</li>
<li> I have sensitive gums.  </li>
<li> Cheaper than the store by far.</li>
<li> I need to use soft brush heads for my Oral B power toothbrush.  </li>
<li> I tried these brush heads as my teeth are sensitive.</li>
<li> it did not help the sensitive teeth, they were still sensitive.</li>
<li> I recommend them for anyone with sensitive teeth issues.</li>
<li> Those looking for a name brand sensitive replacement head, this it it.</li>
<li> The brushes are soft, but not too soft.</li>
<li> My hubby and I both have sensitive teeth, and these replacement heads are just the thing for us.  </li>
<li> He says the brush starts getting soft in about a month</li>
<li> , I will let my next dental appointment be the real test.</li>
<li> The bristles are a bit too soft.</li>
<li> This is the only site where I have been able to find this product as it is not available in the stores in my area.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s difficult to find the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; brushes, let alone for a good price.  </li>
<li> Good brushes and not too expensive.</li>
<li> Good but expensive.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if these are original oral-b or just cheap imitation.</li>
<li> but rather it rotates about 90 degrees to the left then back to the right.</li>
<li> with these extra soft ones i brush the same as with regular ones and i dont feel the pain but still get clean teeth with ease.</li>
<li> It is small and circular in shape so that you can easily brush ever surface of each tooth.</li>
<li> They are different in that they have a different brissel pattern and they help clean different areas of the teeth.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands but they feel cheap, fall apart or just don&#x27;t measure up to the same quality as these.</li>
<li> These aren&#x27;t original equipment and they sometimes slip gears or don&#x27;t work as expected but for the price I just throw the ones that don&#x27;t work away and move on to the next in the package.</li>
<li> I would recommend them to anyone who wants a really good cleaning without irritating your gums!!</li>
<li> I think the only downside to this great little brush is the hole in the middle which means toothpaste runs down the handle after you&#x27;re done brushing (and eventually onto the counter).</li>
<li> These sensitive brushes are hard to find in stores, but apparently are better for one&#x27;s teeth and gums than the others.  </li>
<li> Soft bristles , just what i wanted, anyone with a sensetive mouth or especially sensitive gums will know that its hard to find the right balance of soft bristles that are firm enough to make sure it gets the job done.</li>
<li> I would totally recommend this to anyone who cannot afford one of the high end electric toothbrushes with a sensitive mode.</li>
<li> I hoped that they would be as successful and of similar quality to those in the expensive kit.</li>
<li> but mostly they are small enough</li>
<li> Accordingly, I would rate my overall experience as fair and I am not sure if I would order other products from this company</li>
<li> A little louder, but not bad.  </li>
<li> This rechargeable provides strong, hard brushing, even with soft btushes.  </li>
<li> I highly recommend this brush and this seller as I did not see this type in the local stores.</li>
<li> and I highly recommend over standard brushes.</li>
<li> so I gave him the handle for an extra and bought a new Oral B as my old one had no battery life.</li>
<li> These brush heads are large enough to cover every tooth, yet soft enough that they don&#x27;t damage your enamel.  </li>
<li> In the past a new brush always seemed too harsh, and by the time it was feeling more gentle</li>
<li> They were very expensive to buy in the stores, so I was happy to find them on Amazon.com.  </li>
<li> Usually, \\&quot;Dual Clean\\&quot; heads also were available, but I do not like them.</li>
<li> They are no where near as soft as Rotadent brushes which I would consider extra soft.</li>
<li> are back to normal now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> My teeth feel the same as they did when I was using the normal head.</li>
<li> The heads were exactly what we expected and work great.&lt;br</li>
<li> The shipping was prompt, the product was well packaged and exactly what I expected.  </li>
<li> Not as soft as the soft disposable chew sticks but much softer than all the other Oral-B heads.</li>
<li> I could no longer find the regular brushes (without the new plastic &#x27;thingys&#x27;</li>
<li> They really are the same as I once bought locally and now can&#x27;t find, but</li>
<li> nothing exciting here, the less you pay for it the happier you will be.  </li>
<li> Everyone has soft or medium etc, but not the extra soft which my dentist recommends I use.</li>
<li> These were gentle on my gum line and you can definitely still feel the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; that your standard brush head will give you.</li>
<li> This brush is soft enough for sensitive teeth, something which had deterred me from buying an electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Further, why can&#x27;t a company make a fully oscillating head since these are the only heads that showed any improvement over the toothbrush in a very reliable study?</li>
<li> I think we all must take an action here, go back to buy at department store near you to stop this s</li>
<li> Oral-B seems to be following the template that computer printer manufacturers have developed: make the price of the main unit (in this case, the charger and brush handle; in HP&#x27;s case, the inkjet or laser printer) artificially low and then recover your costs by jacking up the price of the refills (the brush heads and the ink cartridges).</li>
<li> I like brushing with Oral-B&#x27;s sensitive, extra soft brush heads.  </li>
<li> These include floss action, sensitive, regular, etc.</li>
<li> I had read a few complaints in other reviews about fit and quality, but these seem to be exactly the same as those I have purchased for years, and I have never had any problems.  </li>
<li> Because I have very sensitive teeth and gums I need a product such as this.</li>
<li> My wife can&#x27;t use the regular brushes as her teeth are very sensitive.</li>
<li> My husband has very sensitive teeth and receding gums and this brush works especially well for him.  </li>
<li> I had trouble with bristles falling out from the very first use.  </li>
<li> I use these extra soft brushes in mine so not to irritate my gums!</li>
<li> This brush head gives my teeth a very clean feeling, and I can reach way back to the hard to get teeth.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
<li> I was afraid I was going to get a cheap knock off versions of the original Oral B Brush Heads as I&#x27;ve seen those before around.</li>
<li> At first, the vastly smaller size made me feel like it was ineffective, but I actually think it forces me to focus on brushing each tooth/gum and also helps with the timer because I actually spend a few second on each tooth which takes me the full two minutes.</li>
<li> I agree that these are a little pricey, but well worth it.</li>
<li> These work really well to clean my teeth without irritating my gums.</li>
<li> Also like the warning light if you&#x27;re pressing too hard.</li>
<li> these brushes are hard to get now, amazon has always had them available on line.</li>
<li> highly recommend them even though they&lt;br /&gt;are more expensive than the generics.</li>
<li> This results in minimum \\&quot;medieval\\&quot; type of cleaning with a sharp tool or the use of ultrasonic cleaner that they just love to use just above the gum which results in less discomfort after a vist to the dental hygienist.  </li>
<li> They are gentle and last a long time.</li>
<li> So I decided to order some additional brush heads that were extra soft because of the wear on my teeth surfaces.</li>
<li> Well, as you brush your teeth, if you put too much toothpaste on, some of it can leak into this teeny opening OR if you are careful and no toothpaste / toothsoap run off gets on the handle</li>
<li> When I read the reviews of the Oral-B electric toothbrush, I ordered these soft brush heads at the same time as the electric toothbrush itself.  </li>
<li> I was looking for sensitive replacement heads at the local pharmacies and supermarkets but could not find it.</li>
<li> I can no longer find the Oral-B Power Sensitive Replacement toothbrush at the local stores.</li>
<li> This soft head is the only one I can use for my tender gums.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s extra soft and doesn&#x27;t irritate my gums at all.</li>
<li> The toothbrushes came as represented, 2 soft packs of 3 extra soft/sensitive brush heads per item x5, they did not increase S&amp;H with the increased order quantity, and shipment was received 2 days before the estimated delivery time.</li>
<li> They don&#x27;t last as long but its worth it in the long run.  </li>
<li> you have sensitive gums, USE THIS BRUSH ONLY!</li>
<li> These are by no means soft, but softer I suppose than the regular ones maybe.  </li>
<li> My dentist told me I should only be using the soft toothbrushes.</li>
<li> My wife likes the extra soft brush and I like the medium one.</li>
<li> extra soft brush heads,&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
<li> I prefer sensitive as my dentist has always recommended the softest brush possible.</li>
<li> We prefer the extra soft brushes as they are easier on the gums.</li>
<li> Using Oral-B Sensitive brush heads has improved ny dental health as well as reducing the wear and tear on my gums that a regular brush would produce.</li>
<li> I bought this product because it probably has the highest bristle density, and the bristles are extra soft</li>
<li> I have several sensitive  teeth.</li>
<li> My dentist told me my gums are starting to recede and I need a soft toothbrush head.  </li>
<li> outside bristles seem to be as soft as the dentist recomended.&lt;br</li>
<li> Like extra soft brushes so this is the answer for me.</li>
<li> I had stopped using an electric toothbrush entirely until I found the Oral-B Sensitive and these toothbrush heads.</li>
<li> Use-wise, it feels like it&#x27;s not too soft, and gives just enough</li>
<li> I needed to get some extra brushes for my [[ASIN:B003UKKHB4 Oral-b 3000 Professional Care 3000 Electric Toothbrush]]</li>
<li> I received the extra soft heads like I ordered.</li>
<li> I had problems with soreness and bleeding when using regular soft tooth brushes.  </li>
<li> If you have a similar problem with soreness or bleeding, I would also suggest that you use a toothpaste for sensitive teeth.</li>
<li> This is my second order for the Oral-B Sensitive Extra Soft Brush heads from Amazon.com</li>
<li> Fast shipping and the item works as expected.</li>
<li> These are extra soft heads</li>
<li> You too might be worried that the soft bristles might not brush enough, but they do.&lt;br</li>
<li> These heads are hopefully soft enough to accomplish that.</li>
<li> I switched from the regular brush head to the sensitive head to protect from over brushing at the gum line.  </li>
<li> This came in a non-retail packaging (makes me think it&#x27;s refurbished) and when attempting to submit for rebate as offered, I received a notification back from Oral-B stating that the UPC code sent in with the rebate form was invalid, despite the fact that it came directly off of the packaging that was sent.  </li>
<li> I always try to buy my Oral-B sensitive brush heads from Amazon. com because they are cheaper than in the local stores.  </li>
<li> All dentists recommend now adays to go with a soft brush head whenever possible, as there is no noticable increase in plaque removal going with a rougher brush.  </li>
<li> I never realized a sensitive brush head existed until recently.  </li>
<li> It says extra soft brush heads- which they are in feel..</li>
<li> my dentist tells me soft or extra soft are the only two options for brushes.</li>
<li> I have been using the generic brushes marked &amp;#34;Soft&amp;#34;as</li>
<li> Especially if you floss anyway, the sensitive heads are easier on your mouth and seem to work just as well.</li>
<li> extra soft bristles for my toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
<li> Had gotten so that even using sensitive toothpaste with the regular heads wasn&#x27;t helping.  </li>
<li> The sensitive brush head is smaller and gentler on the gums and hopefully keeps tartar at bay.</li>
<li> The sensitive brushes, like the regular ones, work well.  </li>
<li> Kind of expensive, though.</li>
<li> The compact round head lets me get behind those back molars and gives a great massage to my gums.  </li>
<li> Kind of expensive</li>
<li> Unfortunately, you do have to buy the tooth brush replacement heads from time to time which are pretty expensive, but well worth the cost since the tooth brush system is so good at cleaning your teeth.  </li>
<li> a tad ok not great</li>
<li> When I use a new one, I run hot water over it for a few seconds for the first few uses to make the bristles a bit softer.</li>
<li> The other kind you have to really pay attention not to press down too hard</li>
<li> The regular ones hurt my gums, especially when they are new.</li>
<li> I recently purchased a new toothbrush, and got this extra &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; for a spare.</li>
<li> I also use Sensodyne Pronamel which has made my teeth much stronger and less sensitive.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t need a new toothbrush as long as I can get these replacement brushes.  </li>
<li> Item came on time and was exactly as advertised and cost less than elsewhere&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
<li> I have a very old Oral-B electric toothbrush and it has been a long time since I replaced the brush heads.  </li>
<li> With the correct tooth past and this product I keep the clean and white.  </li>
<li> Great brushes, but is a little expensive without sales.  </li>
<li> Went for my checkup after using the Oral-B toothbrush and these brush heads for four months and the hygienist remarked that she hardly had to do anything since everything was so clean</li>
<li> They are much \\&quot;kinder\\&quot; to my gums than other brush heads.</li>
<li> Unlike other items that popped up on a search for Oral-B toothbrush heads, these are real Oral-B quality and you can tell.</li>
<li> The brushes are comfortable and last typically around 3 months, which is about as long as you can expect toothbrushes to last.</li>
<li> My teeth are very sensitive and I have no trouble with this the way I did with the other styles.</li>
<li> However, I will say that they&#x27;re genuine, as a lot of bad knockoffs are available.</li>
<li> Threw the sensitive brush heads away and went back to the regular brush heads and our teeth</li>
<li> I have an Oral-B Pro Series toothbrush, and I only buy these Extra Sensitive heads.</li>
<li> I use this basically once a week while using an actual soft brush 6 nights a week to prevent further recession.</li>
<li> that the standard adult Flexisoft EB17 has dual colors, while the Extrasoft heads are all blue.</li>
<li> and they actually fit my approximately twenty year old Braun tooth brush.</li>
<li> they made this extra soft for kids and especially for gum receding people</li>
<li> The name-brand ones are relatively long-lasting, but pricey; however, I&#x27;ve purchased non-name brand ones (from Target), which I did not like--not soft enough.</li>
<li> sensitive replacement heads are difficult to find in store or dentist office - glad I can get a 3 pack ...</li>
<li> Well my background is using the sensitive function on a more expensive Oral-B electric toothbrush.</li>
<li> They are as expected, classic brush heads replacements, I like the fact that they are soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Highly recommended - electronic toothbrushes take a little time to get used to, these brushes make it natural!</li>
<li> Works great and is soft on my gums, but all the bristles are the same length so it can be a little difficult to keep the bristles in one spot for long.  </li>
<li> I GENERALLY am a review &amp; research freak and will ONLY purchase something that I&#x27;ve read reviews on</li>
<li> Our young kids use our old Oral-B toothbrushes, and these heads work extremely well for them.  </li>
<li> Perhaps we should give them to all kids and teach them how to use at a young age, in the long run it would save us all money and pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Extra soft brushes are not as \\&quot;soft\\&quot; as I would like them to be, but definitely softer than the regular heads.  </li>
<li> have been using this soft version for so long</li>
<li> Whether you choose the standard brush or the extra soft will be an individual decision.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m glad I started with sensitive heads instead of regular because my gums were not used to electric toothbrushes and even with these, they still bleed if I hit them at the wrong angle.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using the first brush head for a few weeks now</li>
<li> I was loathe to give up my electric toothbrush, but kept pushing down too much on the brush head.</li>
<li> Because the brushheads are so gentle, I feared they were not cleaning as well, but to my extreme delight, my teeth are cleaner than ever - and this from one who always gets complimented for my home care by my dental professionals!</li>
<li> Highly recommend to other sensitive-mouth folks.</li>
<li> I would highly recommend it after comparing with other Oral B brush heads models.</li>
<li> These brush heads typically run about $20 for a set of 3, so the Amazon price of under $11 for a set was a real steal.  </li>
<li> why are these so costly, and no one is really any less</li>
<li> They don&#x27;t last really long, but I have sensitive teeth</li>
<li> I have sensitive gums, and I have found that the normal brush heads are a bit too harsh.</li>
<li> I had several gum areas that were sensitive to the previous Oral-B brush heads I was using, and those areas were marked by my dental hygienist as receding.</li>
<li> I have a new Oral B electric tooth brush and the brushes that came with the unit were way to stiff for my sensitive teeth.</li>
<li> I would highly recommend purchasing one of the Braun Professional Series Electric Tooth Brush systems if you are a as crazy about clean teeth as I am.</li>
<li> and you can easily clean your entire set of teeth with this brush head unlike some of the larger ones where it&#x27;s hard to get in small areas of your mouth.be certain that it&#x27;s not me</li>
<li> , the price is a little much, but that&#x27; s how the company makes it&#x27;s money</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t feel like I am pointlessly allowing the brush to hover aimlessly (which happened with the dual clean because its coverage area was so large that it felt pointless to brush for that long).</li>
<li> These brush heads are small enough and soft enough to clean the little curves of my teeth without pushing the gums away from the teeth.</li>
<li> Some honest reviewers do not understand what a product is for or how to use it and will trash a product simply because they are just plain dumb.</li>
<li> I would have given a 5/5 if the sensitive electric brush heads were much closer in price to tandard bristle electric brush heads, and if I had had the oppertunity to have used one for at least 3 months from the time of this review to find out the lifespan of this variety of replacement head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I tried other brands but Oral-B is the only one that fits properly and is sensitive.</li>
<li> As much as l like the idea of My Oral B brush,the brushes I had were too stiff and they bothered my teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
<li> which mine are, at least right now.  </li>
<li> I have a very hard time finding the &amp;#34;SENSITIVE&amp;#34; grade of replacement brush and I live in a large metro area.  </li>
<li> I know that we are looking at an extra soft tooth brush, and I do like extra soft usually.</li>
<li> I have terrible sensitive gums and these heads are very gentle and nice to them.</li>
<li> after viewing a few options seriously -- including the more normal-hardness bristles, I went with these.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple other brands and their &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; brush heads, but these are the softest by far.  </li>
<li> I chose the sensitive teeth version due to receding gums.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
<li> These work extremely well if you have sensitive gums.</li>
<li> I chose the sensitive heads due to the comfort level</li>
<li> A little still on the high end of the price point though, I did find others cheaper</li>
<li> I BOUGHT MY ORAL B NEW BLACK TOOTHBRUSH BY ORAL B</li>
<li> The small round head will clean even the most difficult areas of the mouth.  </li>
<li> It seems to be at least on par with my previous harder oral-b brush, but I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s doing a better job yet.</li>
<li> but I found that they also clean my teeth poorly.</li>
<li> so when your hand goes up and down, you get double action.</li>
<li> The other one was pretty abrasive and gumline recession is no fun!</li>
<li> Good standard product and much less expensive at Amazon!</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;d encourage sorting reviews by date to let you know if there&#x27;s been recent bad batches of this kind of item sent out recently...</li>
<li> I just bought my first electronic toothbrush and bought these for at least the beginning.</li>
<li> They seem to last a long time as well.</li>
<li> Also, experience teaches that these last a long time.</li>
<li> And they last for a fairly long time.</li>
<li> The last a long time, too.</li>
<li> I switched to these rather than the generic ones Ive long been buying...</li>
<li> It takes too long to brush my teeth because there aren&#x27;t enough bristles.</li>
<li> If you don&#x27;t know how long you have brushed this toothbrush will tell you.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll only ever purchase these as long as they are made.  </li>
<li> It seems like it won&#x27;t last too long before wearing out.</li>
<li> They are soft enough not to bruise the gums but stiff enough to do a thorough job of cleaning all teeth.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s really hard to find something specific like this at a reasonable price.  </li>
<li> They also seemed to wear out sooner than the same exact brushes I have been purchasing locally for years, but they are getting very hard to find.</li>
<li> I&#x27;d definitely keep an eye out for cheap prices though as these can get expensive.</li>
<li> Then I saw the extra soft brush heads and after reading a few reviews decided to try it.</li>
<li> I had gum surgery a few years ago, so I try to be careful, and these extra-soft brush heads are extremely gentle while still doing what they need to</li>
<li> (although they have become expensive as of late), and keeps a good charge.  </li>
<li> I did give this item a 2 star review because I DO like how it is soft for those w/ enamel issues and does get in small spaces of your teeth (like the last set of teeth in the back) and you can easily clean your entire set of teeth with this brush head unlike some of the larger ones where it&#x27;s hard to get in small areas of your mouth.</li>
<li> did give this item a 2 star review because I DO like how it is soft for those w/ enamel issues and does get in small spaces of your teeth (like the last set of teeth in the back)</li>
<li> How long the heads last is a matter of opinion, they lose their initial stiffness in a couple weeks, then takes a couple months for the blue to wear down.  </li>
<li> (The Extrasoft is a little too soft, and the Ortho is overpriced)&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
<li> They do not fit exactly snug, there is a little bit of play with the brush</li>
<li> These leave your teeth feeling very cleaning, not to hard</li>
<li> This still cleans your teeth, but in a gentle way without leaving  brush scratches on your teeth, yes that happens people when you brush too hard.</li>
<li> me start off with my complaint saying that I am a very hygienic person</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using an Oral-B (Braun) electric toothbrush for the past 8 years and I like the extra soft brush</li>
<li> I believe it is unwise to use the Oral B toothbrush with its normal heads, because teeth are delicate if you want them to last into your 90s or beyond.</li>
<li> These brushes are supposed to be soft, but they feel quite firm to me</li>
<li> I got rid of my Sonicare electric toothbrush because there were no soft bristled brush replacements for it.  </li>
<li> The dentist said that the circular motion helps to prevent gum loss which is caused by the rough back and forth motion we are often taught as kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> /&gt;They are harder to find in local stores, so sometimes you have to order online.&lt;br</li>
<li> Long overdue.</li>
<li> These heads are not much softer than the regular ones and they get worn out after just a couple months of brushing, from my experience.</li>
<li> My son like this oral-b sensitive brush heads although it is not cheap.</li>
<li> Clean\\&quot; heads for a long time.</li>
<li> It does not fit the Sonic Complete.  </li>
<li> I will continue to purchase them here on Amazon as long as they are competitive in their pricing.</li>
<li> As long as I can find them I&#x27;ll buy them.</li>
<li> have used these brush heads for years and will continue as long as I brush my teeth.</li>
<li> I was disappointed at first because they weren&#x27;t soft enough, but after using them for a few days they softened right up.  </li>
<li> Just plain old brush head doing its job.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t anticipate them to last as long as other brush heads though</li>
<li> Anyway, this might sound crazy, but when I use these toothbrush heads, I find that the toothpaste doesn&#x27;t adhere to the brush long enough to cover my mouth.  </li>
<li> The reason I initially ordered this was due to the recommendation from my orthodontist.  </li>
<li> It is expensive but worth it my friend!</li>
<li> I think this is because the tiny head on these brushes can even get behind my wisdom teeth where a normal, larger headed brush couldn&#x27;t reach.</li>
<li> The head is small enough that it reaches all the teeth inside my mouth, especially the ones in the back.</li>
<li> This my second one the other  wore out.  </li>
<li> AND I AM HAVING OTHER EXTENSIVE DENTAL WORK BEING DONE ALSO.</li>
<li> I would recommend this above any of the other brushes they offer.</li>
<li> It is a little costly for such fragile brush heads.</li>
<li> He showed medical photos of a young trainee who &amp;#34;performed oral surgery on herself&amp;#34; by using a hard bristled brush.</li>
<li> Extra soft brushes are hard to find.  </li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t know I had sensitive gums, but the regular brush heads were awfully hard on my gums.  </li>
<li> , I lay it with the head hanging over the sink so it can drip off and dry.</li>
<li> Soft, yet gentle cleaning getting into these difficult areas where any germs like to hide.</li>
<li> With the regular heads, I had more painful brushing.</li>
<li> but I didn&#x27;t want anyone disgarding my main complaint about these toothbrushes by thinking it was me or my lack of hygiene.  </li>
<li> Few days later, I received the short.</li>
<li> The standard heads for this electric brush, which include tiny plastic &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34; devices, are a bit too harsh for me.</li>
<li> I experience much less bleeding (almost none after a few days) using these brushes compared with the generic types marked soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The medium to stiff bristles seem too large in diameter and stiff.</li>
<li> However, this series seems to not last as long as the previous one I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
<li> is the one Dr. recomended me my mouth cavity is small and still I am adult used a biger toothbrouch provoque vomit to me</li>
<li> It works, but is so loose he has it taped to the toothbrush.  </li>
<li> I bought these because the brush that came with my new Oral-B Pro 1000 was too hard on some of my gums.  </li>
<li> do find that the blue indicator wears down sooner than I would expect.</li>
<li> The Oral-B only has an on and off function, so there is no calming down the motor in it.</li>
<li> you want to make them last longer, don&#x27;t press down or try to scrub your teeth.</li>
<li> Still, I&#x27;m happier with my Oral-B unit than I was with Sonicare, which wasn&#x27;t engineered as well (the toothpaste would inevitably run down the handle of the brush and get all over my hand, which doesn&#x27;t happen with the Oral-B).</li>
<li> The Floss Action works better at getting in between teeth, but can be a bit hard on the gum line (but not as bad as the standard brush head).</li>
<li> usually switch to a new brush head every other month, so</li>
<li> Forget all of the rest of the brush heads, they are very harsh on sensitive gums.</li>
<li> These brushes worked well with the sensitive mode on my Oral B 5000, although I found that my teeth didn&#x27;t feel too bad even when using the full attack mode of the electric</li>
<li> These are the same as the brushes sold in stores for much less.  </li>
<li> I bought two sets of three heads each, for less than the cost of only three heads in the stores I searched. . .</li>
<li> This brush head works well with my Oral-B electric toothbrush and it costs half the price as the same pack at Target.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Compared to the standard brush head, it feels a lot softer (although I&#x27;m not sure it cleans as well as the standard one).</li>
<li> its small but big enough to reach all the surfaces of your tooth if you move your tooth brush around.</li>
<li> The head was so small, it felt like it was more tedious to brush your teeth.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, these aren&#x27;t tough enough to really get in and clean my permanent retainer and they&#x27;re a little wimpy for brushing my tongue.  </li>
<li> and you certainly don&#x27;t need a tough abrasive brush head.</li>
<li> Bought due to some minor dental issues, and these heads are working well.</li>
<li> Very hard to find this brush extra soft at any price.</li>
<li> I only wished the little colored rings came on the  brush, and I did not have to put them on.  </li>
<li> /&gt;However, the design of the overall system is a little off.</li>
<li> The regular ones are a little rough on my gums</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t give up on your Oral-B electronic toothbrush without trying the sensitive heads, which are hard to find at retail.</li>
<li> The floss action was just to hard on my teeth.</li>
<li> The bristles are not too soft or too hard.</li>
<li> It is hard to find the 3-pack of Soft brush heads in my town, so it&#x27;s easier to buy them on Amazon.com</li>
<li> The Oral-B Sensitive brush heads are sometimes hard to find in the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;</li>
<li> My dentist recommended that I use a soft bristle either all of the time or at least &gt;50%</li>
<li> I purchased this because I felt hurt a few months ago by the regular one</li>
<li> These are as expected.  </li>
<li> I can never find these in the store - and on the rare occasion I do - they are incredibly expensive.  </li>
<li> the regular brush heads seem to hurt my teeth after a few uses.</li>
<li> and I see absolutely no difference.  </li>
<li> Money well spent.</li>
<li> Perform as expected.</li>
<li> Shipping as expected.</li>
<li> Unlike the generic brush heads, these heads stay firmly on the toothbrush.  </li>
<li> Product as expected.</li>
<li> Just what we expected.  </li>
<li> I expected to have a  massage setting and a  timer device indicator for brushing length.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve always found the regular heads a tad harsh.</li>
<li> This product works as expected and is well built.</li>
<li> Functioning as expected.</li>
<li> Works as well as expected.</li>
<li> The heads work as expected .</li>
<li> My brushes were as expected.  </li>
<li> the product is what was expected.</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re thinking about saving a few bucks by buying the generic ones at walmart, don&#x27;t.</li>
<li> I was an oral hygeniest in the military.</li>
<li> Everything is as expected.</li>
<li> Fits the oral B brush as expected.</li>
<li> I tried the generic brand and they were a waste of money, the longest one lasted 3 weeks, and the shortest one broke in just 4 days.  </li>
<li> harder to find this item.  </li>
<li> They work as expected.</li>
<li> Oral-B appears to be slipping.</li>
<li> After a few weeks use, the bristles are starting to spread.</li>
<li> Buy these if you think the others are too rough.</li>
<li> However, took longer than expected to arrive.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few weeks,</li>
<li> I have had the electric brush for years, but I always had to use the harder brushes</li>
<li> I also purchased this toothpaste that&#x27;s all good ingredients for rebuilding your enamel and strengthening teeth (and actually doing it, not just using fluoride which is terrible for your teeth)</li>
<li> /&gt;This brings me to my main complaint about this product: it is NOT RECYCLABLE!</li>
<li> Super scary because suddenly the small metal parts just come out and land up in your mouth while brushing.</li>
<li> It has soft bristles and i&#x27;ve never encountered any problems while using this even if I &amp;#34;accidentally&amp;#34; brush too hard, which I can&#x27;t say about the other</li>
<li> I tried the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; generic brand and the brussels were way too stiff.</li>
<li> Not much I can say other than they work as expected</li>
<li> If you like the brush, you&#x27;re pretty much a captive audience especially as the generic brushes have terrible reviews.</li>
<li> These extra soft brush heads can be hard to find at stores and usually out at the dentist office.  </li>
<li> I recently  had trouble finding the Oral-B brushes I usually use, so I tried a similar non-Oral-B brand.  </li>
<li> THey feel less harsh than the standard issue</li>
<li> These replacement brush heads are pretty expensive if you go through one ever 3 weeks.  </li>
<li> Still trying some of Oral-B&#x27;s other heads as well.</li>
<li> when I told her that my other family members didn&#x27;t have this issue, she was at a loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> when I told her that my other family members didn&#x27;t have this issue, she was at a loss.    </li>
<li> Other ones cause discomfort and may wear away my gums.  </li>
<li> I would not use any other brush.</li>
<li> Other &amp;#34;reviewers&amp;#34; will give products - that they have never seen and never used - glowing 5 star ratings - for a fee.  </li>
<li> These brush heads do not wear out like other &amp;#34;Oral-B&amp;#34</li>
<li> Looking forward to trying other brush heads now.</li>
<li> I prefer these to the other Oral B heads.  </li>
<li> HAVE OTHER DENTAL WORK</li>
<li> Small enough to get everywhere.</li>
<li> per my periodontist, my gums have healed extremely well.  </li>
<li> Is this Amazon over power other?</li>
<li> Apparently, it does make a difference--or at least that&#x27;s what my dental hygienist said.</li>
<li> They&#x27;re essential, not available in my area!</li>
<li> I purchased another one of these electric toothbrushes, since my other one wore out.  </li>
<li> bristles fall off like I have seen in other reviews- part</li>
<li> I recommend trying these if you&#x27;re experiencing discomfort with the other models.</li>
<li> Is softer than other oral b brushes and easier on gum.</li>
<li> I had begun using the Oral-B toothbrush due to my dentist recommendation.  </li>
<li> bought other ones as well</li>
<li> That usually means that I&#x27;m brushing the rest of my mouth with the bubbles built up from those initial teeth (versus from the toothpaste itself).  </li>
<li> My gums have receded and I have to be very careful what I brush my teeth with.</li>
<li> I actually brush for four minutes, which gets very messy, while I do a series of strengthening exercises at the bathroom.  </li>
<li> Not as hard as traditional oral b brushes in the center</li>
<li> These tooth brush heads appear to work well, but they&#x27;re a little loose for the Oral-B toothbrush and fall off as you&#x27;re brushing.  </li>
<li> I have utilized the regular heads, and they were very tough on my sensitive gums.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve read some unhappy reviews on brush heads that apparently seem to be the same thing, but turn out not to be quite the same.  </li>
<li> The brushes feel soft against the gum, but don&#x27;t get weak in use.  </li>
<li> Seems they need to be replaced a little sooner than some of the harder bristle ones.</li>
<li> The previous ones I&#x27;ve used were extremely durable and lasted months passed the recommended replacement date.</li>
<li> Instead, you run the risk of gum recession; especially if you are brushing too hard and improperly.  </li>
<li> Now you can get at those hard to reach places at the back with ease.</li>
<li> i guess the others are hard on teeth and gums, especially on electric brushes.</li>
<li> Using brushes daily can be hard on the gums.  </li>
<li> My hubby &amp; dentist have confirmed that I don&#x27;t have an issue w/ bad breath or abcessed teeth</li>
<li> i never liked the regular \\&quot;soft\\&quot; brushes that are included with the electric toothbrush</li>
<li> Yes, at least I am not throwing away a full-sized toothbrush; however, I know that there is a company that makes (&amp; recycles) toothbrushes, but they are not powered, only manual.</li>
<li> I tried the non oem brands but it&#x27;s not worth it.  </li>
<li> I am tired of going to stores like Walmart and they don&#x27;t have the Sensitive in stock.  </li>
<li> it does not clean as well as the other oral B brush heads.</li>
<li> I plunked my money down and have faithfully been using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> For me the cost brings down my review to three stars.</li>
<li> Pressing down just wears the brushes out faster.</li>
<li> Do NOT press down on your gums.  </li>
<li> I won&#x27;t brush with any other!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using these toothbrush heads for a month now and don&#x27;t think I will ever use any other type!</li>
<li> The other brushes that come with the oral b brushes seem to be to harsh for my gums.</li>
<li> I know it&#x27;s odd to point all that out</li>
<li> and yet they still have this slight musty smell to them from time to time that grosses me out.  </li>
<li> My gums have improved, my teeth feel less gunky.</li>
<li> a harder or uneven brush head can cause irritation on the gums and uneven cleaning.  </li>
<li> I received this product in less than a week.</li>
<li> Half the price, twice the product</li>
<li> That thing is already running at whatever ridiculous 400 billion oscillations per second.</li>
<li> so I don&#x27;t use it overlong and the price is even less..</li>
<li> bristles are already showing wear after less than a month of use.  </li>
<li> LESS PLAQUE</li>
<li> I worry less about gingival recession or enamel erosion now.</li>
<li> I bought it to replace a previous one that stopped working after 3 yrs.</li>
<li> The brush is softer than what I had previously</li>
<li> For packs of five or less, Amazon prices cannot be beat.</li>
<li> The doctor told me to use less abrasive toothpaste and these brush heads.</li>
<li> My previous order for replacement heads from another vendor did not work at all.  </li>
<li> usually the need for floss is minimal.  </li>
<li> I can eat hot or cold items and without pain.  </li>
<li> These are a bit expensive for the amount you get, but they last for quite a long time.  </li>
<li> I feel like my teeth are not clean.</li>
<li> Eventually (3 to 6 months maybe) they get a little bit &amp;#34;loose&amp;#34; in the mechanical parts</li>
<li> I wanted to switch to another type, and I did a little research.</li>
<li> I had stopped using the electric tooth brush and after a couple of years, although I was diligent with the manual brush, I noticed that my gums seemed to be receding a little.  </li>
<li> Brushes marked &#x27;firm&#x27; belong in hardware stores, not in people&#x27;s mouths.&amp;#34; Of course I wish these replacement heads were less expensive.</li>
<li> Cleans very well without making my gums bleed and doesn&#x27;t set off my tooth sensitivity for heat or cold.</li>
<li> but it is not fit.</li>
<li> It was a waste of my time to have to return it.</li>
<li> DOES NOT FIT:</li>
<li> they should cost a few bucks.&lt;br</li>
<li> I am using this heads for a few weeks now.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t feel like it is too harsh on my gums and teeth</li>
<li> Product summary should have stated which tooth brushes the replacement heads would not fit.</li>
<li> The store brand did not fit correctly on the brush head</li>
<li> I change them every few months.</li>
<li> He uses his brush everyday.</li>
<li> and I was nervous about whether or not this would be too harsh for me to use.  </li>
<li> but the bristles still seem just a bit too firm.  </li>
<li> anyway, a few points to note.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I hate this feature and would throw the whole system away if it weren&#x27;t for the fact that it keeps my gums from getting brushed away and helps with recession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Not a huge savings though.</li>
<li> Nicer than stock, but still a little stiff.</li>
<li> Highly recommend for thin enamel and weak gums.</li>
<li> After reading the bad reviews which some of the supposed Braun brushes have received (not working right, break-downs)I placed my order with fingers</li>
<li> All other brush head just too hard on my teeth</li>
<li> Every other Oral-B head is too hard on my gums and makes them bleed.  </li>
<li> ...and gets into those hard to reach places due to the size of the head.  </li>
<li> The whole thing looks discoloring and poor quality!!</li>
<li> The others are too stiff with fewer bristles.</li>
<li> a mean the main machine expensive</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not particularly easy to stop drooling and spilling toothpaste all over the place in use.</li>
<li> A little pricey at round $20.00 for 3!</li>
<li> Much less expensive than the similar power brush that we had before.</li>
<li> Added bonus is the fact that these brush heads were a lot less expensive than in my local stores.</li>
<li> My gums were hurting and bleeding pretty bad.</li>
<li> I know that sounds stupid, but it&#x27;s true.</li>
<li> but the head slowly breaks down and comes a part on the ball joint.</li>
<li> I also realize now that I previously was brushing too hard.</li>
<li> My wife and I have tried the other styles of brushheads and she complained that some of them were too bulky and made it difficult for her to reach her back teeth.</li>
<li> /&gt;It does not have any of those hard, thick bristles that some of the other ones do.</li>
<li> Brushes are a little hard from what they used to be causing me to question &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; in the description.</li>
<li> These are outrageously priced in stores, and very cheap on Amazon, though the price keeps changing.</li>
<li> Decent price, these are very expensive in CVS, Wal-Mart, etc.</li>
<li> There is a small opening...like a mini window where you can see a teeny metal spring inside.  </li>
<li> I have been purchasing this item on Amazon for the past 2 years.</li>
<li> I was not confident about this company.</li>
<li> However, company initially shipped me the wrong product.</li>
<li> there are some things that i usually buy in the store that i&#x27;ve decided to buy at amazon, this being one of them.  </li>
<li> Does not fit my Oral B Vitality as indicated!</li>
<li> So no more floss heads or medium heads.</li>
<li> Small, circular head cleans between teeth.</li>
<li> I usually replace every three months.</li>
<li> ; compatible products I used in the past.</li>
<li> The brush head is too small.</li>
<li> However, I usually store it on the charger, to overcome that issue.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, the same could be said of the brush heads.  </li>
<li> so I usually didn&#x27;t.  </li>
<li> the past I would shop for OralB-like tooth heads, often ordering non Oral-B brands.</li>
<li> The only similar experience was the Rotadent which was way expensive and also difficult to find replacement heads.</li>
<li> It may be a small head</li>
<li> Love our Oral B Bruan, but think the cost of replacement heads is outrageous.</li>
<li> But this one is crazy soft.</li>
<li> Whenever we would brush our teeth if felt very harsh and caused a lot of vibration on our teeth.</li>
<li> Just after a very few times of use, it looked wornt out.</li>
<li> But when you get to brushing they feel very firm and sturdy.  </li>
<li> Our only complaint is that the brush heads are getting expensive.</li>
<li> No more gum irritation from bristles that are too hard for me.</li>
<li> Makes a slight humming noise - might be annoying, if you&#x27;re new to electric</li>
<li> Impossible to find these soft brush replacement heads in retail stores.</li>
<li> and I buy the Up and Up Target replacement heads that are a little less expensive than the brand name heads.</li>
<li> They are hard to find, however.  </li>
<li> I have a problem with brushing too hard, but these brushes solved it.</li>
<li> I like without the continuing gum recession I was getting from hard brushing.</li>
<li> Still feels hard on my teeth.</li>
<li> just what I have been trying to find, always hard to find the extra-soft brush heads in stores.</li>
<li> They are hard to find in the stores.</li>
<li> I tend to be a hard tooth brusher.  </li>
<li> Now the dentist tells me I&#x27;ve been brushing too hard for decades.</li>
<li> One suggestion is not to press the bristles hard on your teeth when using these electric toothbrush replacements.</li>
<li> But with the reg hard brushes, my gums were receding..</li>
<li> These are hard to find and purchase, thankful that Amazon has these brush heads and hope it</li>
<li> Once you&#x27;ve bought into the Oral B vibrating toothbrush technology you have to replace the brush head every 3 months (according to my dentist who may or may not own stock in Oral B).</li>
<li> The others failed after only about 3 brushings, springs were to thin</li>
<li> This is NOT a genuine Oral-B product!!</li>
<li> they are really expensive on other sites and in stores.  </li>
<li> No more bleeding!</li>
<li> I would recommend this to anyone who is serious about avoiding gum disease.</li>
<li> The bristles are hard and irritating.</li>
<li> It was really uncomfortable to brush our teeth with the stiff bristled toothbrush head that came with the electric toothbrush.</li>
<li> I often press too hard when brushing and end up with receding gums because of that, and these softer heads make it difficult for me to press too hard.</li>
<li> One way I know it&#x27;s time to change the head on this toothbrush is when the bristles are feeling noticeably hard!</li>
<li> I was a bit skeptical about the choice of toothbrush heads I bought, since there seem to be quite a few reviews about un-authorized or generic/knockoff brush heads being sold, especially a few years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
<li> not sure why these brush heads are so expensive.</li>
<li> but I found that in the mornings, the bristles are very hard.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s disappointing and annoying every time, so I plan to return to the other brush heads for my next purchase.</li>
<li> These brush heads are durable and aren&#x27;t too tough on my gums.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t understand how anyone else hasn&#x27;t complained about this issue - maybe I&#x27;m taking care of them wrong</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t understand how anyone else hasn&#x27;t complained about this issue - maybe I&#x27;m taking care of them wrong</li>
<li> The only downside is I hate what these replacement heads cost.</li>
<li> * ineffective cleaning before it turns into poor oral health.  </li>
<li> the cleaning without irritating gum tissue.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
<li> Be warned, Amazon might be confused about this item and selling it incorrectly labeled.  </li>
<li> I am very serious about cleaning my teeth</li>
<li> At least in my experience, the \\&quot;generics\\&quot; rotating brush head will loosen and sometimes come off completely in less than a week, AND can painfully trap part of ones cheek in the gap between the rotating and non-rotating parts!</li>
<li> It looks like it would be awful on sensitive teeth</li>
<li> I have used these fake heads before bought off of Ebay</li>
<li> They are always too expensive, though.</li>
<li> I bought these with some concern that they could be the fake ones.</li>
<li> and they are expensive to replace.</li>
<li> Been awhile since I fell for that one; I&#x27;ve just hated how much these stupid refills cost.</li>
<li> They still seem expensive to me, but the cheaper ones reportedly don&#x27;t hold up.  </li>
<li> These are expensive in stores.  </li>
<li> Expensive</li>
<li> WAS UNABLE TO FIND THIS SET WHERE I SHOP, SO DECIDED TO PURCHASE FROM AMAZON!&lt;br</li>
<li> It is just a shame that they are such an outrageous price - are they being phased out or something?</li>
<li> (These are generally expensive to replace.)  </li>
<li> I bought the wrong product.  </li>
<li> Replenishing the brushes is as expensive as buying the brush/charger--obviously this is where the money is made.  </li>
<li> His gums were receding and he had horrible white patches on his teeth.  </li>
<li> I have used the wrong attachment &amp;#34;for</li>
<li> I was afraid my toothbrush motor was going to die.  </li>
<li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with toothbrushes!</li>
<li> Too expensive!</li>
<li> The generic brands are terrible (bristles that stick btwn teeth, horrible experience, I even swallowed one once).</li>
<li> My brain isn&#x27;t buzzed as badly as with the Sonicare.  </li>
<li> BAD idea.  </li>
<li> Bad move on my part.  </li>
<li> /&gt;You will not be disappointed if you buy these refills for the Oral B toothbrush</li>
<li> You&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
<li> These are just what I needed, and I&#x27;ll be ordering them again, assuming I don&#x27;t wear out the brush base itself.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are nice replacement heads, but after using these for several years, I have come to realize they are not actually that sensitive when it comes to toothbrush heads. There are many manual options nowadays that have very soft fine bristles that clean between the teeth much better. The Oral-B is a good interim toothbrush, but with even the lightest &amp;#34;mis-use&amp;#34; one can wear down gum tissue in the process of trying to clean thoroughly. Dentists seem to be recommending electric a lot these days, but after returning to a manual, better-designed toothbrush, my teeth are cleaner than ever, and the gums and gumline are healthier than during the many years of electric tooth brushing. I have always liked Oral-B, but I think I will stick with my return to the toothbrush. I do give the 4 out of 5 stars because the product itself is good, but it is not for everyone.</li>
    <li> Fast deliver and good quality</li>
    <li> Works great on sensitive on teeth</li>
    <li> Love these but not the price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these forever. The regular head is rough on my gums; the sensitive cleans as well or better and is easier on the gums. I can get six months use of of one (I change after each dental visit); changing more often wouldn&#x27;t work. Just be sure to rinse before putting back in the holder or the inside gets a little goopy.</li>
    <li> My favorite toothbrush, and this is my my favorite toothbrush head for it.  More gentle that the floss action one and cleans very well.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended the Oral B to me about 15 years ago.  Been using them ever since.  I have receded gums.  These allow me to brush everywhere without abrading my gums further.</li>
    <li> I think the only downside to this great little brush is the hole in the middle which means toothpaste runs down the handle after you&#x27;re done brushing (and eventually onto the counter). Not sold on the shaft design, but the bristles are gentle enough.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Oral B Plusonic but it is not fit. I try to check the compatibility but can&#x27;t it on product description. And since there is some words say this product compatible with &amp;#34;Most Oral B  Power Brushes&amp;#34; so I believe it and then wast my money....</li>
    <li> The whole family seem to be liking them.</li>
    <li> Seem to be good, and should be since they aren&#x27;t aftermarket.</li>
    <li> The bristles are way to soft. I much prefer the floss action ones and will order those next time.</li>
    <li> I love the electric brush. What a difference in my oral routines. my teeth are shinier and cleaner. in ordering the sensitive brush my dental doctor recommended the softest I can purchase to reduce gum problems. Just a nice product. it sure will make a difference come cleaning time . thanks</li>
    <li> Great brushes!  Not as hard as traditional oral b brushes in the center but they do not have the plaque removing bristles that the traditional brush has.  Still, much easier on the teeth and gets the job done leaving your teeth feeling clean and polished as they should. Great brushes!</li>
    <li> These are a bit expensive for the amount you get, but they last for quite a long time.  I would purchase again when the need arises.</li>
    <li> Been using these for years, long-lasting, work great!</li>
    <li> These replacement toothbrush heads fit my toothbrush and last a long time.  It&#x27;s nice to find them online and at a good price!</li>
    <li> Got genuine ones from Amazon, so far they seem like that. I change mine every three months as recommended.</li>
    <li> Our dentist recommends only SENSITIVE oral B (or any kind) tooth-brush heads, or tooth brushes.  They are hard to find, however.  We really like them, though.</li>
    <li> My husband has very sensitive teeth, and these seem to work very nicely for him! They were a good value.</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED THESE BEFORE AND USED THEM UP.  JUST BACK FOR MORE.  COULD NOT FIND THEM IN THE STORE.  I REALLY NEED THE EXTRA SOFT.</li>
    <li> Perfect for sensitive teeth!</li>
    <li> Just what the dentist ordered :-)</li>
    <li> I purchased an Oral-B electric toothbrush from Amazon on the recommendation of my dentist because I have worn the enamel off. So I decided to order some additional brush heads that were extra soft because of the wear on my teeth surfaces. I also signed up so that additional  brush heads are sent automatically every 3 months. The automatic ordering is a great idea and can be cancelled anytime.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> Works the best for sensitive gums and implants. What more can you say about a product that does what you expected?</li>
    <li> Had several electric brushes over the recent years, roto-dent, sonic care etc.  This really out cleans either of those, you will feel the difference when you run your tongue over your teeth.  They even look whiter believe it or not than they used.</li>
    <li> Finally got an Oral B after all these years. The sensitive brushes are perfect for me. Kind of expensive, though.</li>
    <li> A while back my dentist sold me an entire kit with various brush heads for different purposes.&lt;br /&gt;This particular type of brush head supplied with that set, proved to be most comfortable. I simply used that one for all purposes:&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to find that I could order these heads without buying an entire kit. I hoped that they would be as successful and of similar quality to those in the expensive kit. They are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive teeth and gums. My hygienist recommends that I brush my actual gums well to stimulate and keep them healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I wondered if this brush would be effective.  Yes, it is.  It is not ridiculously soft and seems perfect for a sensitive mouth.&lt;br /&gt;My gums seem much healthier. The bleeding seems to have stopped. I am delighted with this product.</li>
    <li> I like these heads- I&#x27;m glad I started with sensitive heads instead of regular because my gums were not used to electric toothbrushes and even with these, they still bleed if I hit them at the wrong angle.</li>
    <li> I HAVE SENSITIVE TEETH AND THESE ORAL-B BRUSH HEADS WORK GREAT. I AM GLAD THAT AMAZON CARRIES THIS BRAND AND MODEL, BECAUSE THEY WORK !!!!</li>
    <li> This 3 pack was a great deal. It&#x27;s exactly what i needed for my Oral-B toothbrush. I recommend ordering if you need replacement heads.</li>
    <li> These replacement brush heads are pretty expensive if you go through one ever 3 weeks.  Glad I could save a little through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Item was received in a timely fashion and was just as described,</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended and it&#x27;s been fantastic.</li>
    <li> This is just what our family needed. It was really uncomfortable to brush our teeth with the stiff bristled toothbrush head that came with the electric toothbrush. Whenever we would brush our teeth if felt very harsh and caused a lot of vibration on our teeth. With the new sensitive brush heads, we are all more comfortable now.</li>
    <li> I like this toothbrush since its much gentler than normal Oral-B toothbrushes. One brush lasts me about 1 month used once a day.</li>
    <li> These are what I wanted and arrived promptly. Thank you!</li>
    <li> The extra-soft variety of these brush heads is impossible to find on the shelf at local stores, so I was glad to find it online at such a good price. Shipping was fast and efficient.</li>
    <li> These soft brush heads are just what i needed.I could not find them any cheaper any where.I been using a oral b toothbrush for years and love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad to have found these. They are much gentler on my gums and teeth, and seem to do the same effective job as the other Oral-B heads I have tried. Highly recommend to other sensitive-mouth folks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these Oral B heads for a few years now, and they&#x27;re great for my sensitive teeth.  They&#x27;re a bit pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> This vendor has the best prices on the web.  This brush heads sell for $24.95 at Target.  Great place to shop.</li>
    <li> My son needed the replacements so i&#x27;m glad i found them for such a great price.</li>
    <li> These brushes are supposed to be soft, but they feel quite firm to me and I&#x27;m an aggressive brusher (which is why I want a soft brush--I wear away my enamel).  If you have sensitive teeth and require a truly soft brush, or if you plan to use this brush for children, I couldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Best brush head I have ever used! It is small and circular in shape so that you can easily brush ever surface of each tooth. The bristles are the softest I&#x27;ve seen on an electric toothbrush and will not wear away your teeth and gums if light pressure is used. The head moves in a spinning motion but does not make a full 360 but rather it rotates about 90 degrees to the left then back to the right. The bristles change color from blue to white as you use them to remind you when to change the bristles.</li>
    <li> These are awesome on my teeth and gums.  Still trying some of Oral-B&#x27;s other heads as well.</li>
    <li> These work very well, good for sensitive gums, but clean well.</li>
    <li> Use these all the time, great product. it was shipped right away and arrived quickly, despite it being during the Christmas rush. Decent price, these are very expensive in CVS, Wal-Mart, etc.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  It is gentle on gums and teeth but does a very good job of cleaning and also controlling the formation of plaque.  This results in minimum \\&quot;medieval\\&quot; type of cleaning with a sharp tool or the use of ultrasonic cleaner that they just love to use just above the gum which results in less discomfort after a vist to the dental hygienist.  I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> These work very well.  I am pleased with them.</li>
    <li> Great Toothbrush heads for sensitive teeth</li>
    <li> I cannot even use the regular brushes because these are SO great!!  10 stars for this if it&#x27;s possible...</li>
    <li> I love Oral B it is one of the most effective ways to brush your teeth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp; so affordable -- I have been buying this product for quite a while the price is GREAT !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed if you buy these refills for the Oral B toothbrush</li>
    <li> Good on my sensitive teeth. All other brush head just too hard on my teeth</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Oral-B Professional Care electric toothbrush set with these Oral-B Sensitive brush heads for over 4yrs now.  I GENERALLY am a review &amp; research freak and will ONLY purchase something that I&#x27;ve read reviews on but I went in for a dental appointment years ago and my dentist insisted that this would help my receding &amp; inflammed gum issues and assured me that HE did his research and assured me that this IS the absolute best product out there, told me about some testimonials of his customers so I was sold! I plunked my money down and have faithfully been using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this was my first electric toothbrush, I couldn&#x27;t compare any former experience and simply didn&#x27;t know any better.  I DO have to say that other than my &#x27;unsanitary&#x27; concern about these that I&#x27;ll get to in a moment, it&#x27;s great! I love it, it allows me to thoroughly brush without worrying about brushing too hard, it&#x27;s very easy and uncomplicated to use, the charge on the toothbrush portion holds for a long time, these toothbrushes are really comfortable, stay on just fine, I have never had any &#x27;break&#x27; or get wobbly on me, there is a color indicator where the blue area on your toothbrush gets lighter over time to let you know when it&#x27;s time to swap out your toothbrush, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start off with my complaint saying that I am a very hygienic person, I brush 2-3 times per day, floss, clean my tongue, take showers every day, my bathroom is not musty - it&#x27;s clean &amp; smells good, my home is clean - in fact I&#x27;m actually somewhat of a germaphobe so I HAVE to have things clean or it grosses me out.  I know it&#x27;s odd to point all that out but I didn&#x27;t want anyone disgarding my main complaint about these toothbrushes by thinking it was me or my lack of hygiene.  :-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter WHAT I do...I&#x27;ve tried using bottled water to brush my teeth thinking it&#x27;s our tap water (it&#x27;s not...my kids &amp; hubby don&#x27;t have an issue w/ their toothbrushes); I&#x27;ve tried switching to a different toothsoap / tooth powder / toothpaste - and I STILL have the same issue.  My hubby &amp; dentist have confirmed that I don&#x27;t have an issue w/ bad breath or abcessed teeth so it&#x27;s not in my mouth...so I&#x27;m left to think that is DEFINITELY the DESIGN of Oral-B toothbrush replacements heads!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Humor me for a minute and do a &#x27;zoom&#x27; on the picture of Oral-B replacement toothbrushes in the middle of the toothbrush handle.  There is a small opening...like a mini window where you can see a teeny metal spring inside.  Well, as you brush your teeth, if you put too much toothpaste on, some of it can leak into this teeny opening OR if you are careful and no toothpaste / toothsoap run off gets on the handle while brushing then certainly a mixture of that &amp; water runs over the handle area and if not everytime you brush then SOMETIMES some of the gunk gets in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DO make a habit of actually removing my brush head in running water and I try to be certain that none of that residue is neither on the electric toothbrush handle portion (where the brush sticks &amp; on the bottom where you place the charger) AND on the toothbrush head itself - both on the brush area and on &amp; inside the handle and yet they still have this slight musty smell to them from time to time that grosses me out.  I actually have to change them MUCH more often than normal and wipe down my electric toothbrush handle with peroxide &amp; a clean washcloth (since I didn&#x27;t know where the smell was coming from) AND I stick the toothbrush heads through a clean cycle in my dishwasher every week or hot, hot water and let it air dry AND rotate brush heads so each one gets a chance to thoroughly dry.  It does NOT happen when I take all of these precautions but in my opinion, I shouldn&#x27;t HAVE to do this in order to avoid the musty smell...musty stench means that bacteria is harboring &amp; growing so to stick something filled with germs to &#x27;clean&#x27; with is not the best option in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: On several occasions, I swapped to a manual toothbrush to be certain that it&#x27;s not me and sure enough, it&#x27;s not me! A friend of mine has a Sonicare brand and doesn&#x27;t have that teeny hole in the brush handle so I&#x27;m currently on a search in reading reviews and comparing models to replace my Oral-B set.  Bummer - I love it otherwise but I think it&#x27;s a design flaw in the brush design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d rather not have to worry if my toothbrush is growing bacteria or not, I want to simply rinse the brush &amp; handle after each use and store it away like I&#x27;m supposed to be able to do.  I SHOULD be able to use it until the blue indicator bristles tell me that I need to change it and not any sooner.  I don&#x27;t understand how anyone else hasn&#x27;t complained about this issue - maybe I&#x27;m taking care of them wrong but I&#x27;ve even called the company and it was suggested that maybe it was our water or toothpaste...when I told her that my other family members didn&#x27;t have this issue, she was at a loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are also looking &amp; comparing brands: At a GLANCE at the pictures here on Amazon, the Sonicare replacement toothbrush heads do not seem to have that window on the brush head - just like my friend said AND the bottom of it looks like it&#x27;s more dome shaped so the toothpaste &#x27;gunk&#x27; from brushing &amp; rinsing I would hope would simply slide off the &#x27;dome shape&#x27; vs getting embedded in the area that your toothbrush head handle &amp; electric toothbrush handle would connect.  The Oral-B&#x27;s design is more flush - flat if you will so gunk can easily get in so you have to rinse it out thoroughly after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did give this item a 2 star review because I DO like how it is soft for those w/ enamel issues and does get in small spaces of your teeth (like the last set of teeth in the back) and you can easily clean your entire set of teeth with this brush head unlike some of the larger ones where it&#x27;s hard to get in small areas of your mouth.be certain that it&#x27;s not me and sure enough, it&#x27;s not me! A friend of mine has a Sonicare brand and doesn&#x27;t have that teeny hole in the brush handle so I&#x27;m currently on a search in reading reviews and comparing models to replace my Oral-B set.  Bummer - I love it otherwise but I think it&#x27;s a design flaw in the brush design.

For those who are also looking &amp; comparing brands: At a GLANCE at the pictures here on Amazon, the Sonicare replacement toothbrush heads do not seem to have that window on the brush head - just like my friend said AND the bottom of it looks like it&#x27;s more dome shaped so the toothpaste &#x27;gunk&#x27; from brushing &amp; rinsing I would hope would simply slide off the &#x27;dome shape&#x27; vs getting embedded in the area that your toothbrush head handle &amp; electric toothbrush handle would connect.  The Oral-B&#x27;s design is more flush - flat if you will so gunk can easily get in so you have to rinse it out thoroughly after each use.    I did give this item a 2 star review because I DO like how it is soft for those w/ enamel issues and does get in small spaces of your teeth (like the last set of teeth in the back) and you can easily clean your entire set of teeth with this brush head unlike some of the larger ones where it&#x27;s hard to get in small areas of your mouth.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have been purchasing this item on Amazon for the past 2 years. Wal-Mart and Target both charge nearly $27 dollars!! Thanks for the great price!!</li>
    <li> Item came on time and was exactly as advertised and cost less than elsewhere&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> I have a an electric tooth brush, I needed some brush heads, and this order  was exactly what I needed to do the job![[ASIN:B00006ANDK Oral-B Sensitive (3 Extra-Soft Brush heads)]]</li>
    <li> I find this brush to be far more comfortable to use than the standard Oral-B brush head -- no gum irritation at all, but it still gets my teeth feeling clean.  I alternate between this brush and the Floss-Action head (the one with the plastic paddles in addition to the bristles). The Floss Action works better at getting in between teeth, but can be a bit hard on the gum line (but not as bad as the standard brush head). Using and alternating between both the soft and the Floss Action works very well for me.</li>
    <li> Love this! I only use this brush.</li>
    <li> Always buy Oral-B replacement heads not off brand. The others are too stiff with fewer bristles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m totally happy with the quality and price of these Oral B replacement toothbrush heads.</li>
    <li> Great product ... Great Service!!</li>
    <li> The first shipment is sort (3) brushes, I sent an email to request. Few days later, I received the short. I was not confident about this company.</li>
    <li> These are soft and won&#x27;t irritate your gums or be abrasive on your teeth. I like them better than the standard &#x27;Professional Precision&#x27; brush from Oral-B.</li>
    <li> Great electric toothbrush replacement heads.</li>
    <li> When I read the reviews of the Oral-B electric toothbrush, I ordered these soft brush heads at the same time as the electric toothbrush itself.  Went for my checkup after using the Oral-B toothbrush and these brush heads for four months and the hygienist remarked that she hardly had to do anything since everything was so clean -- that is a first for me!  I used another highly-rated electric toothbrush for three years and never had as good a dental checkup as this last one.</li>
    <li> This softer head is the most comfortable brush they have.</li>
    <li> The only location I can get updates without running all over the place. Fiber construction that reaches in-between teeth instead of the large nubbies.</li>
    <li> The Brushes are easy to use in my Oral B Electric Tooth Brush.  I only wished the little colored rings came on the  brush, and I did not have to put them on.  I am older and my fingers do not work like they used to, but the overall quality of these brushes is excellent.</li>
    <li> Brush is gentle on the gums while leaving the clean feeling I expect from Oral B, all for a good price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I felt hurt a few months ago by the regular one and it is good by far. It is soft and I like it. Now I am just using both depending on how I feel on each day.</li>
    <li> Wife was not to keen on the new Oral-B Sensitive at first and said that see would give it a try but didn&#x27;t realy like the bruch head. I purchashed the sensitive brush head and she is all go now. I just wish the rest of the order would come.</li>
    <li> I love my Oral-B rechargable toothbrush b/c my teeth really feel clean. The only downside is I hate what these replacement heads cost. Don&#x27;t be lulled into thinking you can do as well nuying the generic heads tho. You&#x27;ll be disappointed. The generics I tried just about destroyed my toothbrush- got stuck and took great effort to get it off. You save nothing if you lose your initial investment.</li>
    <li> So far so good with these replacements.  Will likely purchase them again.</li>
    <li> Dentist recommended it, I ordered it. Definitely felt the softness difference between this and the regular Oral B brush heads I&#x27;d used for years. Seller was also great -- speedily shipped the product, and shipping was free though the total was less than $20</li>
    <li> These fit the electric brush I bought years ago but rarely used before. They are gentle and last a long time. Good price vs. other places.</li>
    <li> If your dentist tells you your gums need gentler bristles, these are for you. They are significantly softer than the \\&quot;soft\\&quot; ones I&#x27;ve used before, but they still do a good job cleaning teeth. My hygienist told me I couldn&#x27;t find these locally and she was right, so I&#x27;m glad they are available here.</li>
    <li> The compact round head lets me get behind those back molars and gives a great massage to my gums.  My brain isn&#x27;t buzzed as badly as with the Sonicare.  Really love this product!</li>
    <li> I was looking for sensitive replacement heads at the local pharmacies and supermarkets but could not find it. Amazon was the only place that offered them. Great item, thank you, works well with my Oral B electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> They worked just as good as the original toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> The dentist suggested these and it was a good suggestion. Much more comfortable that the regular brush heads.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive gums, and I have found that the normal brush heads are a bit too harsh. These sensitive brush heads are great, and still give a great clean.</li>
    <li> Came as I shown. Met all my expectations.</li>
    <li> Good quality brush heads below the price usually found at drug and grocery stores etc. These heads at least for me, do a good job in getting between the teeth and usually the need for floss is minimal.  Beware the \\&quot;generic\\&quot; replacement heads which look alike, but are usually priced lower and offer more heads for a given price. At least in my experience, the \\&quot;generics\\&quot; rotating brush head will loosen and sometimes come off completely in less than a week, AND can painfully trap part of ones cheek in the gap between the rotating and non-rotating parts!</li>
    <li> Have been looking for sensitive, soft brushes for a while and although I probably could have found locally, this was much more convenient and I received in a couple of days.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Started chemotherapy and have a sensitive mouth. These replacement heads are effective and don&#x27;t  irritate my mouth. I recommend to anyone with sensitive gums and children.</li>
    <li> A great price for a must have item.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I bought these from Amazon for my Braun elec toothbrush. Genuine product from German. Works like a charm. I&#x27;ve always prefer soft brushes since my teeth are sensitive.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent price. I was getting generic brushes at the store for the same price. Anyway these work really well and I would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> I was quite surprised by the quality and performance of these brush heads. If you have sensitive teeth, these are the ones you want.</li>
    <li> These brush heads are durable and aren&#x27;t too tough on my gums. They seem to last a long time as well. One star off for price, however, since seven dollars a head it seems a bit steep.</li>
    <li> My gums have receded and I have to be very careful what I brush my teeth with. I was very glad to find these extra-soft brush heads for my Oral-B electric toothbrush. They are much \\&quot;kinder\\&quot; to my gums than other brush heads.</li>
    <li> The Oral-B Sensitive Extra-Soft Brush heads are gentler on the gums than the stiffer \\&quot;regular\\&quot; brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why these brush heads are so expensive. But they do seem to be worth it.  My dentist tells me that my teeth and restorations (fillings, crowns) look \\&quot;polished.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Better than my previous one. This is a good set, saves me the time from buying each one separately and also saves me money.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended that I use a soft bristle either all of the time or at least &gt;50% so I bought these and they are super to this point. Have not yet been in for a check up but really like them at the moment.</li>
    <li> Oral B Sensitive Toothbrush Heads&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sensitive bristles are extremely soft and also fine. In my honest opinion, the sensitive toothbrushes are generally a better way to clean your teeth. The medium to stiff bristles seem too large in diameter and stiff. These type of bristles are great for scrubbing stubborn particles, but not really that great for everyday cleaning of teeth especially when you use toothpaste that has fine abrasive particles. These brushes worked well with the sensitive mode on my Oral B 5000, although I found that my teeth didn&#x27;t feel too bad even when using the full attack mode of the electric brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 5/5</li>
    <li> When these brushes get worn out, I swap them out with a new one and I can FEEL the clean difference!  Wish they didn&#x27;t cost so much...but &#x27;tis life!</li>
    <li> These are the same as the brushes sold in stores for much less.  I will continue to order them from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I prefer the soft headed bristles because they are more dense in packing. These bristles do not hurt my gums. I have no teeth problems &amp; I have no gum problems. Also, it seems to polish my teeth well. These brushes last the same amount of time as the medium bristles.</li>
    <li> This, extra-soft brush are right for me. This is obviously a &amp;#34;personal preference&amp;#34; product. Apparently, the comment requires six more words!</li>
    <li> These are as expected.  I have purchased these before.  They are soft and effective  They fit the Oral B toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Use the zoom function and look how the word \\&quot; convenient \\&quot; is spelled.  I have seen many fakes before where spelling and punctuation on the packaging is wrong.  I have used these fake heads before bought off of Ebay and they do fall apart in your mouth presenting a potential choking problem especially for kids.</li>
    <li> These are the softest brush heads I have used so far for any electric toothbrush. I&#x27;m currently pregnant and needed soft bristles since gums are sensitive during pregnancy, these fit the bill perfectly. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is NOT a genuine Oral-B product!! The whole thing looks discoloring and poor quality!! It was a waste of my time to have to return it.</li>
    <li> I really like that these replacement heads are soft bristles, as I have sensitive teeth. I would definitely order these again. It is a good deal for the price!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a must have if you have the brush. They are a good system.</li>
    <li> As good as expected ;)</li>
    <li> When I searched for replacement heads for the Oral-B CrossAction Power, this is the product that came up first. The item description states that this product is compatible with all Braun models. However, upon receipt, the package clearly states: DOES NOT FIT: Vitality Sonic, Sonic Complete, Pulsonic, CrossAction Power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging says this product IS compatible with Triumph, Professional Care, Vitality+, and ProHealth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review saves others the aggrevation of returning a product they can&#x27;t use.</li>
    <li> I got rid of my Sonicare electric toothbrush because there were no soft bristled brush replacements for it.  I bought the Oral_B Professional Healthy Clean Precision electric toothbrush and these heads.  I was disappointed at first because they weren&#x27;t soft enough, but after using them for a few days they softened right up.  I could use heads just a bit softer, but these work just fine.</li>
    <li> Great I&#x27;ve used for years</li>
    <li> the gentle brushhead makes brushing with the powerful oral b handle a pleasant experience. i never liked the regular \\&quot;soft\\&quot; brushes that are included with the electric toothbrush so i never switched till i found this alternative. works with the new triumph too.</li>
    <li> So glad to find sensitive replacement heads!</li>
    <li> Glad to find these on Amazon so I can follow my dentist&#x27;s instructions and swap them out every 3 months. Love the soft sensitive bristles.</li>
    <li> I gave these to our grown children for Christmas, and bought one for me.  My dentist commented on the improvement of my teeth  and gums.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed.  Much better price than stores.</li>
    <li> Dentists always say to use the softest brushes for your teeth so I only use these for my oral-b brushes.  The work well but I do wish they&#x27;re cheaper....amazon has the best price anywhere.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> So glad I found these on Amazon...they are really expensive on other sites and in stores.  I love my toothbrush but the heads had gotten pretty worn out - these made it good as new again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  It is excellent choice for sensitive teeth.  The price offered by Amazon cannot be beat.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to all who are interested in quality at a great price</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive teeth and these are perfect- they hold up for the proper amount of time, too.</li>
    <li> These replacement brush heads work well.  I love the Oral-B toothbrush they fit.  I will never go back to a regular brush.  When I&#x27;ve had to use on because I ran out of replacement heads, I didn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;d really brushed my teeth.  The electric toothbrush gets your mouth clean.</li>
    <li> Works just like the one&#x27;s I pay more for in the store.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for about two weeks and I have had no problems.  I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Oral B EB17- 3  Toothbrush I like it and this particular form like more because three pieces for replace is the one that we regular find in the market but keep separate is new for me, here in Latin America first it not common to see, and find first we got the toothbrush a mean the main machine expensive and them replace part werent find so for me was really nice to find and also separate keeper better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With regard the toothbrush oral B is oral B is the one Dr. recomended me my mouth cavity is small and still I am adult used a biger toothbrouch provoque vomit to me so small one with circult form is the best.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and fits the electric toothbrush correctly.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for many years and my dentist confirmed that my teeth have never been in a better shape. I also use Sensodyne Pronamel which has made my teeth much stronger and less sensitive.</li>
    <li> Not much to say other than these work great and are usually a much better price than in the store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years and it is easy on my teeth and it does a good job.</li>
    <li> Excellent Brush. Better than any soft bristle on the market.</li>
    <li> I have a problem with brushing too hard, but these brushes solved it. I was loathe to give up my electric toothbrush, but kept pushing down too much on the brush head. These extra-soft brushes let me use the electric toothbrush I like without the continuing gum recession I was getting from hard brushing. I will definitely re-order.</li>
    <li> I had trouble with bristles falling out from the very first use.  They also seemed to wear out sooner than the same exact brushes I have been purchasing locally for years, but they are getting very hard to find.</li>
    <li> Everyone should have and utilize an electric toothbrush twice a day. Perhaps we should give them to all kids and teach them how to use at a young age, in the long run it would save us all money and pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought units at costco, but brushes to refresh at Amzaon. Two chargers and units for $80 plus a $15 rebate. Better than a Sonic but either are far better than using a regular brush.</li>
    <li> I can no longer find the Oral-B Power Sensitive Replacement toothbrush at the local stores. I appreciate very much that you have provided me with this product. Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> I love using the extra-soft brush heads. They thoroughly clean my teeth, just as the regular brush heads used to do. It is recommended that you change to a new brush head every season. Even though these are extra-soft brush heads, with my experience, they last just about one season (three-month equivalent) before I need to change it, same as using a regular toothbrush. Of course, this would also depend on how often one brushes his/her teeth; the more you brush, the likelihood would be that changing the brush head would occur sooner than every season/three months. I always check the indicator bristles; the feel of the bristles when you&#x27;re brushing is another way of knowing when to change the brush head. And I love the fact that you don&#x27;t have to do the work of brushing your teeth when the Oral-B toothbrush does it for you. My toothbrush has a two-minute timer, which is enough time to thoroughly clean your teeth. And clean teeth makes you feel good. I would not change my toothbrush system for anything.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with toothbrushes!</li>
    <li> This is the real thing.  They are always too expensive, though.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive gums and teeth, and I buy this all the time. It&#x27;s the real deal and really good.&lt;br /&gt;Of course I&#x27;ll repurchase</li>
    <li> I did recieve my replacement brushes in good order.&lt;br /&gt;I will order again thank you norman</li>
    <li> This soft head is the only one I can use for my tender gums.  Other ones cause discomfort and may wear away my gums.  I need soft brushes because unknown to me I wore away gum tissue by over-brushing.</li>
    <li> The product finally received was fine. However, company initially shipped me the wrong product. When I contacted the company, they wanted me to incur the cost of returning the product. After complaining to the service rep, the company finally relented and provided me with a prepaid shipping label. After the product was returned, it took another 10 days for the company to send me the correct product. Accordingly, I would rate my overall experience as fair and I am not sure if I would order other products from this company</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the Oral B-Sensitive Soft Brush Heads.  Also, the seller, Potential Dynamix LLC, sent the product in a very short time.  The price was very reasonable and it was convenient to order the brushes.  Thank you for the excellent service.</li>
    <li> Nicer than stock, but still a little stiff.</li>
    <li> This brush is less abrasive than the Precision Clean brush.  I like it as a \\&quot;break\\&quot; from the rougher cleaning.  I also have the flosser and polisher brush heads, so I use them all.  Also, it gives your gums a break from too much brushing as that can literally brush away your gums.  I highly recommend this brush and this seller as I did not see this type in the local stores.</li>
    <li> Feels great after using it. So nice and clean! I would order again in the future! Would recommend to friends!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s impossible to find extra-soft brush-head replacements for my Oral B electric toothbrush, so this was wonderful.  They arrived quickly and a package of 3 was perfect.</li>
    <li> Despite the high price, this product has the appearance of a cheap imitation. Presentation and Packaging not as displayed on picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon: Please check and confirm whether this item is an original part manufactured by Oral-B.</li>
    <li> good stuff, my hygienist loves it.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product and the service and timeliness in receiving it.  This is the only site where I have been able to find this product as it is not available in the stores in my area.</li>
    <li> I never liked to change the brush heads on my Oral B toothbrush until I found out about this awesome product. They are PERFECT for my teeth and I swear that it leaves my mouth cleaner than just the regular brush head. I anticipate having to change these more often than the regular ones, since the bristles are more soft, but it is worth the comfort.</li>
    <li> The generic brands are terrible (bristles that stick btwn teeth, horrible experience, I even swallowed one once). So the original brand is definitely worth it for me.</li>
    <li> Perfect!!!  sensitive replacement heads are difficult to find in store or dentist office - glad I can get a 3 pack ... my dental health/gums have greatly improved since using these heads</li>
    <li> Oral-B!  Our lives (and teeth) would not be the same without Oral-B products.  At first I was hesitant to use a power toothbrush.  My hygienist convinced me to give it a try.  My gums have improved, my teeth feel less gunky.</li>
    <li> My favorite toothbrush, good for sensitive teeth but still leaves feeling very clean!!</li>
    <li> I have been buying these for my daughter for years and she loves them.  Highly recommend and will buy again.</li>
    <li> I switched from the regular Oral-B brush head to this Extra Soft Brush head with wonderful results.&lt;br /&gt;Dentist asked us to focus the brush on the teeth and /at the gumline, and the design of the soft head makes it easier to focus the head, and gentler on the gum tissue.</li>
    <li> I bought these with some concern that they could be the fake ones. After spending some time looking at them and the various sites that describe the differences between the real and the fakes brushes I concluded that the ones I got are genuine.</li>
    <li> The brush cleans the &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; from my teeth and teeth feel smoother when they are cleansed from the tartar build-up.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite toothbrush.  The small round head will clean even the most difficult areas of the mouth.  I prefer the sensitive brush head because the bristles are soft and flat across the top. The brush moves very fast and a harder or uneven brush head can cause irritation on the gums and uneven cleaning.  This price was the best I&#x27;ve seen in a long time.</li>
    <li> I have read where some of these replacment brushes are cheap knock-offs.  These brushes appear to be the real deal and work just like the original brushes.</li>
    <li> I received this product in less than a week. I am very pleased with it. I have very sensitive gums and this product gently cleans and removes plaque.</li>
    <li> I can never find these in the store - and on the rare occasion I do - they are incredibly expensive.  Great price and fast shipping!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought these for two kids, ages 7 and 9, when the standard brushes seemed a bit too abrasive and unwieldy for them.  It&#x27;s been a great choice and I intend to replace all our brushes with this version, including those used by adults, even though nobody has sensitivity issues.</li>
    <li> Awesome is all there is to say!</li>
    <li> These are great- they last quite awhile, do a good job, and don&#x27;t pull apart.</li>
    <li> I have had gum surgery and this is just what I needed to use.  It&#x27;s extra soft and doesn&#x27;t irritate my gums at all.</li>
    <li> I am a first time user but product meets my expectations.  I plan to order more and like the fact that soft brush heads are available.</li>
    <li> the regular brush heads seem to hurt my teeth after a few uses. with these extra soft ones i brush the same as with regular ones and i dont feel the pain but still get clean teeth with ease.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using an Oral-B (Braun) electric toothbrush for the past 8 years and I like the extra soft brush head the best of all the brush head varieties (I&#x27;m a dental hygienist and I recommend the soft toothbrush head to all my patients, it&#x27;s gentle on the gums, yet effectively removes plaque). I found the best value on Amazon by BelowCostJML. They not only priced the item most cost effectively, but I truly appreciated the $2.99 S&amp;H for my whole shipment. (I ordered 5x the item of 6 brushes/ea, so 3 bucks S&amp;H for 30 brush heads).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other sellers came somewhat close in pricing but wanted $7-10 S&amp;H fees, not to mention that some would limit you to 1 item (of 3 brushes)/order. So if I wanted to increase the quantity to get the 30 brush heads I got from BelowCostJML, I would have to literally place the order 10 times and pay the ludicrous S&amp;H cost 10x!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thankful for BelowCostJML&#x27;s fair pricing, including S&amp;H and for their great service! The toothbrushes came as represented, 2 soft packs of 3 extra soft/sensitive brush heads per item x5, they did not increase S&amp;H with the increased order quantity, and shipment was received 2 days before the estimated delivery time. Very pleased with the service!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product speaks for itself, I&#x27;ve been a satisfied user for 8 years and I personally find it gentler in the mouth than Sonicare [I&#x27;ve had both], though they are both effective in removing plaque (it&#x27;s just a matter of each individual&#x27;s preference)... I guess the \\&quot;difference\\&quot; would be equivalent to Pepsi versus Coke if you will (not that I&#x27;m encouraging regular consumption of either): they give you the same overall effect, it just depends which one you prefer best. Hope this helped. Happy brushing (and don&#x27;t forget to floss, too). :-)</li>
    <li> This is a fine product.  My teeth have never been in better condition.  I am 78 years old and I still have a full mouth of my own teeth.  As I am a coffee drinker (only for breakfest) the coffee stains my teeth.  With the correct tooth past and this product I keep the clean and white.  I&#x27;d recomend this product to any one who really cares about the condition and looks of their teeth.</li>
    <li> These brush heads are exactly what I needed!!! Will continue to order them from Amazon!! I would recommend them to anyone who wants a really good cleaning without irritating your gums!!</li>
    <li> Kind of expensive and they wear out really fast. But they are good on sensitive teeth/gums like mine, so I continue to buy them.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and to this day have zero cavaties.  It is worth the price.  REALLY</li>
    <li> I was totally pleased with the item especialy the price which is so important nowadays.  The are same quality as the ones that originally came with the brush and I see absolutely no difference.  I reccomend this product highly.</li>
    <li> Good for kids! My daughter 7 y.o. use it without problem.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these about 3 times and they are consistently good quality and work great for me.</li>
    <li> oral B great as always</li>
    <li> These are great. I have very sensitive gums and these do a great job of cleaning my teeth but don&#x27;t damage my gums.</li>
    <li> At times I had found standard bristles irritated my gums.  These clean just as well but no longer have that problem.</li>
    <li> Awesome! This does a great job; not too vigorous a motion for my sensitive teeth &amp; gums. Money well spent.</li>
    <li> I use the Oral-B Sensitive Replacement brushes because they are much softer on the gums versus the standard replacement brush.  They don&#x27;t last as long but its worth it in the long run.  This is my third order.  I am tired of going to stores like Walmart and they don&#x27;t have the Sensitive in stock.  Much easier and cheaper to order from Amazon.</li>
    <li> These Oral-B soft brush heads are wonderful for sensitive gums.  I&#x27;ve just received them, (so I may have additional feedback after some time), but right now I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.  I bought two sets of three heads each, for less than the cost of only three heads in the stores I searched. . . Half the price, twice the product, Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Would recommend to anyone, anytime. I have sensitive gums and these provide the right amount of firmness to clean my teeth, but not &amp;#34;stress&amp;#34; my gums.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those people that used to brush my teeth so furiously that I actually wore away some of my gums. I don&#x27;t have full blown recession or temperature sensitivity - thank goodness, but I tend to stress about it anyway. These brush heads are very soft but still clean well. I like the feeling and find that an electric toothbrush (because it spins and doesn&#x27;t go back and forth) is better for my gums. The dentist said that the circular motion helps to prevent gum loss which is caused by the rough back and forth motion we are often taught as kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the design of the overall system is a little off. That little oval shaped cavity at the bottom of the brush somehow gets filled with red mold very quickly and because it leads to the inner working of the brush head the inside gets gross too. I never leave my brush upright, I lay it with the head hanging over the sink so it can drip off and dry. Still, I find that I have to frequently take the brush head off and clean it with anti-bacterial cloths or it gets caked with gunk - that part of the brush never goes in the mouth, but somehow it still gets gross. I hate this feature and would throw the whole system away if it weren&#x27;t for the fact that it keeps my gums from getting brushed away and helps with recession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These particular brush heads are great and so they get four stars, but you&#x27;ll need to frequently clean the whole system.</li>
    <li> I was afraid I was going to get a cheap knock off versions of the original Oral B Brush Heads as I&#x27;ve seen those before around. But these were the original ones and work as expected on my Oral B 5000 brush handle. The subscribe and save option saves more on these as well.</li>
    <li> This brush head was definitely different from the one that came with the brush (which was floss brush head)... it&#x27;s much softer.  It&#x27;s softer than any of the brushes that I have used so far.&lt;br /&gt;Only 4-stars as I am not an expert in this area.&lt;br /&gt;And Amazon has a great customer service.  One of the best that I have seen.</li>
    <li> I bought these so my family could have one each to use the Oral B electric toothbrush. They work good, no problems. They fit the Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision OralB</li>
    <li> Purchased direct from Amazon - brushes appeared genuine Oral B, right down to the high price (nearly double what they were 2 years ago!).  Appropriate markings and all that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used all the brush head types, and thought that \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; meant these would be gentle but still effective.  Switched to this brush head for a couple weeks.  When hubby asked for whitening toothpaste, I noticed that we were both experiencing staining, something that hasn&#x27;t happened since we&#x27;ve owned a power brush.  Thanks to lots of coffee and tea, I can *see* ineffective cleaning before it turns into poor oral health.  Threw the sensitive brush heads away and went back to the regular brush heads and our teeth are back to normal now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend these for anyone except a brand-new power brush user (for the first brush, while your gums get used to power brushing).  If you must use this brush, I would consider switching to the 45-second/quadrant program.</li>
    <li> Got so excited when I saw the price of this product that ordered it right away, but so frustared when I tried it. Won&#x27;t never order the Oral-B Sensitive Soft Brush Head again. Just after a very few times of use, it looked wornt out. Don&#x27;t recommend it to anybody.</li>
    <li> No complaints, soft as mentioned. My teeth feel the same as they did when I was using the normal head.</li>
    <li> These are great if you have sensitive teeth or not. I recommend them very highly and they are so reasonable in price.</li>
    <li> Way better than my brush&#x27;s original head, very glad I swapped out.</li>
    <li> But I have always had the Oral B electric toothbrushes.  My partner has one and i have one and I also have another at a second home and another close friend has this as well, so it&#x27;s like 5 or 6 toothbrushes in operation at once, so I buy a lot of them.  I think for a toothbrush though, the price is a little much, but that&#x27; s how the company makes it&#x27;s money I guess.</li>
    <li> This is the second time that I have ordered this product.  I waited for the price to drop.  Took a while but it was around $17.00 for 3.  This is a much better price than can be found at the stores and it is not from an off brand.</li>
    <li> I continue to buy these replacement heads because of the price and the brush head tells me when I should replace the brush head because it fades.</li>
    <li> I switched to an electric toothbrush a few years ago and have found that these replaceable heads last much longer than the generic brands. They also cost a bit more, but in my opinion you get extra use out of them.</li>
    <li> I wont&#x27; use anything but electric brush.  However, this series seems to not last as long as the previous one I&#x27;ve used.  May be it&#x27;s softer for sensitive gum.</li>
    <li> Excellent! I will recommend this to others!</li>
    <li> Best deal I could find for these Brush heads. Couldn&#x27;t believe the price. They really are the same as I once bought locally and now can&#x27;t find, but lots cheaper.Super soft for sensitive gums. I love them.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of powered toothbrushes - my mouth just doesn&#x27;t feel as clean when I use a manual toothbrush. I have even, on occasion, used these heads on an uncharged handle and that&#x27;s really when I notice that the power really does make a huge difference! I have an Oral-B Pro Series toothbrush, and I only buy these Extra Sensitive heads. They feel softer on my gums and so I think they are a gentler choice. I have zero gum problems and I have healthy teeth. I have been using these heads for almost 10 years and often get compliments at the dentist. Whenever I have, due to necessity, used the standard, non-sensitive heads, I have noticed that they seem to be much more abrasive on my gums. Not to the extent that using them is painful, it just makes me wonder which is best. I&#x27;m no dental professional, but I do think that high abrasiveness isn&#x27;t the best thing for teeth or gums, so I think that the Extra Sensitive heads give my teeth &amp; gums the cleaning they need, without adding more opportunity for further erosion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do find that the blue indicator wears down sooner than I would expect. I&#x27;ve read that a manual toothbrush should be changed every 3 months and that some electric toothbrushes have better bristles and should be changed every 6 months. I find that the blue begins to fade after one month. I think I&#x27;m an average brusher (twice or more daily) and I even have two toothbrushes I switch between (depending on which is charged &amp; what bathroom I&#x27;m in), so I would think that the indicator would last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brings me to my main complaint about this product: it is NOT RECYCLABLE! Yes, at least I am not throwing away a full-sized toothbrush; however, I know that there is a company that makes (&amp; recycles) toothbrushes, but they are not powered, only manual. (If you&#x27;re interested, the company is called Recycline / Preserve. They sell plates, cups, utensils, toothbrushes, razors, etc. &amp; I do really like their razors) I know that plastic recycling isn&#x27;t the best thing for the environment, but it&#x27;s gotta be better than throwing all these heads in the trash/dump/ocean... I always try to keep them in use as long as is healthy, and when they&#x27;re no longer good for my mouth, I put them to work in my cleaning toolkit, for scrubbing other things (great for behind faucets, some jewelry, the toothbrush itself, etc.) But, I can only keep so many. Anyway, that&#x27;s why I give this product 4 stars, instead of 5. Gentle, but wish they were recycled &amp; recyclable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many thanks to Amazon for making them available at a price comparable to normal good-quality toothbrush prices ($3-3.50 ea), depending on the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rely on reviews here at Amazon to help me make informed buying choices. I hope this review has helped you in the same manner.

    <li> I would not use any other brush. When I was in Air Force basic training, we were marched into an auditorium to hear a variety of speakers - one being a dentist. He showed medical photos of a young trainee who &amp;#34;performed oral surgery on herself&amp;#34; by using a hard bristled brush. Don&#x27;t use anything except a soft bristled brush! They work quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have decided to add the following to all my reviews:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware! Some &amp;#34;reviewers&amp;#34; will trash a product for no reason simply because they are paid to or because sell competitive products. Other &amp;#34;reviewers&amp;#34; will give products - that they have never seen and never used - glowing 5 star ratings - for a fee.  Some honest reviewers do not understand what a product is for or how to use it and will trash a product simply because they are just plain dumb.</li>
    <li> I have tried several of the other brush heads for this series of electric brushes and this one is, by far, the most gentle brush made for this particular electric brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive gums, USE THIS BRUSH ONLY! Forget all of the rest of the brush heads, they are very harsh on sensitive gums.</li>
    <li> Best for small mouths,best investment for good dental health</li>
    <li> I remember years ago theses brushes lasted for ever. Theses ones are good for a month and then stat loosing their brushing strength. I&#x27;m not sure if these are original oral-b or just cheap imitation.</li>
    <li> Every other Oral-B head is too hard on my gums and makes them bleed.  These sensitive heads are the softest I&#x27;ve found.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> Most people get waaaayyy to abrasive with the standard oral-b electric brushes. That thing is already running at whatever ridiculous 400 billion oscillations per second. You need not apply ANY pressure to your teeth with the brush because of this and you certainly don&#x27;t need a tough abrasive brush head. These soft ones are perfect and frankly should be the default ones shipped with the electric brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I find the official oral-b brush heads last way longer and are safer than the generic ones. I&#x27;ve bought the generic ones before, and they work for a while but the head slowly breaks down and comes a part on the ball joint. Super scary because suddenly the small metal parts just come out and land up in your mouth while brushing. Yeah exactly, thats why I go with the genuine oral-b heads. They usually last me 6+ months anyway, especially if you sanitize them every so often.</li>
    <li> These work well with my older model Oral-B toothbrush and I especially like these Extra-soft brush head.  They do not fit exactly snug, there is a little bit of play with the brush but I would purchase these again without hesitation.</li>
    <li> These Oral-B Sensitive brushes are the best brushes for the Oral-B Electric Toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;They are harder to find in local stores, so sometimes you have to order online.&lt;br /&gt; They are definitely worth the effort to get these sensitive brushes.</li>
    <li> The bristles are falling out very quickly, much more quickly than on previous orders.  The manufacturer is producing an inferior product so you have to purchase more frequently.  In the future I will be purchasing the drug store brand of these brushes which will be much more cost effecrive.</li>
    <li> Perform as expected. Shipping as expected.</li>
    <li> Perfectly!!! The best brush for sensitive gum! I love this product! I wish to find in regular store... But works this way...</li>
    <li> I tried the non oem brands but it&#x27;s not worth it.  These are the only ones I will use because the cheaper reproduction ones fall apart.</li>
    <li> My teeth have been healthier than ever since I bought this over a year ago. No issues whatsoever and I buy the Up and Up Target replacement heads that are a little less expensive than the brand name heads. I use this toothbrush twice daily and am very pleased I did!</li>
    <li> The extra soft is much more gentle than the standard soft.  Noticeable difference, particularly if you have sensitive teeth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They wear fairly well though not quite as long as the regular soft brushes.  This is probably because with electric toothbrushes you don&#x27;t use as much pressure on your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another option to get them inexpensively is to use a 20% off coupons at Bed Bath and Beyond which carries all the Oral B heads</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth and theses are great!</li>
    <li> I LOVE my Braun Oral-B tooth brush.  It makes me feel like I&#x27;ve had my teeth cleaned and polished at the dentist&#x27;s office every day.  Unfortunately, you do have to buy the tooth brush replacement heads from time to time which are pretty expensive, but well worth the cost since the tooth brush system is so good at cleaning your teeth.  I would highly recommend purchasing one of the Braun Professional Series Electric Tooth Brush systems if you are a as crazy about clean teeth as I am.</li>
    <li> there are some things that i usually buy in the store that i&#x27;ve decided to buy at amazon, this being one of them.  it&#x27;s cheaper online.</li>
    <li> Works great! Good charge life! And the dentist says it&#x27;s working good to keep my teeth healthier and cleaner :)</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive teeth and this brush head works perfectly for me.  I use it for several of my toothbrush settings.  I would recommend this brush head for anyone with sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> I recently purchase an Oral-B toothbrush. I have been a long-time Sonicare user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to also try these sensitive head brushes besides what came with the toothbrush.  While the other ones do a fine job, I prefer these heads.  They are smaller and seem to me to do a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I miss from my Sonicare brushes is the head cover.  It would be nice to have something that could pop on the brush head especially when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that they are easy to get on and off and rinse easily.</li>
    <li> Using the Oral B electric brush allow one to get excellent cleaning with this head.  The reason I initially ordered this was due to the recommendation from my orthodontist.  The heads come 3 to a package, the arrive in good order and while there are &amp;#34;wear&amp;#34; indicators built in to the coloration of the bristles, it is a good practice to change every 30 days.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> Product came promply and in good condition.  It was exactly what I wanted.  These sensitive brushes are great for abrasion areas of gums.  We recommend them in our dental office.</li>
    <li> After reading the bad reviews which some of the supposed Braun brushes have received (not working right, break-downs)I placed my order with fingers crossed.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes which came from this vendor are exactly what you would expect: they are a decent price and they work fine and they are holding up very well...a good buy.</li>
    <li> These brush heads are easier on my sensitive gums than regular toothbrushes and brush heads that I have tried, even the super soft regular toothbrushes.  I use them with the Oral B 5000 electric toothbrush in sensitive mode.  I figure that the results vary with the electric toothbrush model so I don&#x27;t consider this review universal.  If your gums are more normal, you might not need these brush heads.  Overall, this brush head is more comfortable than any other brush head or tooth brush I have used.</li>
    <li> I was amazed at the price of these toothbrush heads.  They were very expensive to buy in the stores, so I was happy to find them on Amazon.com.  I am very pleased with this product.  They were brand new, and were exactly what I needed for my Oral-B Toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Must have re-placement set. Good price, and quality.</li>
    <li> These are by no means soft, but softer I suppose than the regular ones maybe.  These will definitely still cause recession.  I use this basically once a week while using an actual soft brush 6 nights a week to prevent further recession.</li>
    <li> My gums easily bleed,  and these soft brushes really help keep my gums from getting sore.  I don&#x27;t use any other kind.</li>
    <li> I liked other heads but they were making my gums recede according to my dentist so I searched for something gentler and found these.  I really like them so far and plan to continue using only these.</li>
    <li> Softer than the regular brush heads, but still clean as just good.</li>
    <li> Great product at good price! I searched everywhere for oral b soft brush head and this was definitely the best deal I could find at the time.  Heads work great! Will purchase again when I need replacements again!</li>
    <li> Extra-Soft Brush heads for Oral-B Electric Toothbrush are outstanding! They are gentle on gums and teeth while doing an excellent job of cleaning. Definitely worth ordering through auto pay and ship!</li>
    <li> Though it might not appear so, these \\&quot;Extrasoft EB17\\&quot; brush heads are functionally the same as the \\&quot;children&#x27;s\\&quot; heads sold with various cartoon characters on the package. If you find them listed for about $5 per brush head, that&#x27;s a good bargain (I&#x27;ve seen 1-2 sold for $18).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that the standard adult Flexisoft EB17 has dual colors, while the Extrasoft heads are all blue. Ensure that the description states \\&quot;extra-soft\\&quot; and the illustration is the all-blue bristle head.</li>
    <li> This brush head works well with my Oral-B electric toothbrush and it costs half the price as the same pack at Target.  It&#x27;s a toothbrush, what else is there to say?</li>
    <li> really good great for the kids teeth and gums. Will buy again when we run out!</li>
    <li> I used to use  this brush head but now my teeth are even more sensitive in areas than before. I always use the Oral B flossing power head now. It looks like it would be awful on sensitive teeth but it is better that the sensitive power head and my teeth get good grades at my dentist using the floss brush head.</li>
    <li> always good to have the replacement heads on hand.</li>
    <li> I read excellent reviews for Oral-B  and have always used extra soft tooth brushes.  I hope they never quit making this product.</li>
    <li> Great brush for sensitive gums.</li>
    <li> Does not fit my Oral B Vitality as indicated!</li>
    <li> Reasonably effective in removing plaque</li>
    <li> I love the oral B When I am using it regularly and then use a manual tooth brush I feel like my teeth are not clean. It really does clean your teeth very well.</li>
    <li> I thought I thoroughly reviewed the description to make sure I was ordering the correct toothbrush. But when it came, it wasn&#x27;t the right thing.  Don&#x27;t know if it was my error or theirs.  Either way, it took awhile to get the toothbrushes and then they weren&#x27;t even ones that would work for me.</li>
    <li> This is the real thing. I&#x27;ve been using the same one for a month now with no signs of wear whatsoever. My teeth seem whiter too. My dentist told me I should only be using the soft toothbrushes. So no more floss heads or medium heads. This head has plenty of massage action though.</li>
    <li> Always need to replace our old brushes. These are excellent quality for a very good price and the shipment was received earlier than I expected!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using the regular brushes and kept making my guns hurt and sometimes bleed, after switching to these they don&#x27;t have issues anymore.</li>
    <li> This is the same brush that is overpriced at B&amp;M stores, works like a charm, plus now I don&#x27;t have to wonder if it&#x27;s compatible or not.</li>
    <li> Much better prices than CVS, plus this saved me a trip to go get them. I loved these! They fit perfectly on the toothbrush and are a good deal.</li>
    <li> I just taught having an electric brush would be more fun...thats all. It just rotates..It has no problem, no issues..nothing. Works just fine</li>
    <li> Great product - even with sensitive gums, it is amazing.  I highly recommend this product.  It is expensive but worth it my friend!</li>
    <li> I bought these the same day I bought an Oral-B Pro-3000. I have terrible sensitive gums and these heads are very gentle and nice to them. If you&#x27;re considering purchasing them before even trying the standard head that comes with the Pro-3000, I&#x27;ll tell you it&#x27;s a pretty big difference. I tried the standard head and had to stop after 30 seconds. Well worth the price for the multipack.</li>
    <li> These brushes are fine.  The regular ones are a little rough on my gums and I have enough issues already.  Went to these and they are more comfortable.</li>
    <li> Unlike the generic brush heads, these heads stay firmly on the toothbrush.  Have never had one come off in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are soft and do a great cleaning, but do not irritate the gums.  highly recommend them even though they&lt;br /&gt;are more expensive than the generics.</li>
    <li> The product is very good.  I have lichen plantes in my mouth and this soft brush works best for me.  Excellent service.</li>
    <li> I order these every year for my electric toothbrush.  It&#x27;s a great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> First time trying out the &#x27;sensitive&#x27; replacements. Worth the money, glad we tried these out. They do a great job and are very soft on gums.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful! I have a really sensitive mouth and this toothbrush is perfect in size and gentleness. Highly recommend! And I get it on Amazon subscription so I don&#x27;t use it overlong and the price is even less..</li>
    <li> You can purchase these same brushes at Costco for about the same price.  But otherwise, they fit my toothbrush so I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple other brands and their &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; brush heads, but these are the softest by far.  I originally got the electric toothbrush because my dentist said it might help keep my mouth cleaner, but he cautioned me to get the softest brush heads I could because most people essentially brush their gums away with the standard stiffness brushes.  I would have given 5 stars if 4 brush heads came (there&#x27;s room in the package) for the same or similar price.</li>
    <li> Worked great-no problems! Much much much cheaper than in the stores.</li>
    <li> They came with pool quality. the package was damaged and looks like so cheap and coming from very old inventory.</li>
    <li> This product is the best and value beats all other pricing.  Unlike other brands and regular brushes, the Oral-B extra soft is really excellent for sensitive gums.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these above even Sonicare.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Fast service</li>
    <li> Have this electric toothbrush for several years. My wife likes the extra soft brush and I like the medium one. They both work great but don&#x27;t last very long and they are expensive to replace. For me the cost brings down my review to three stars.</li>
    <li> I really like the way that these brushes go around my gums without being abrasive. Soft, yet gentle cleaning getting into these difficult areas where any germs like to hide. Great feeling after using.</li>
    <li> Great replacement brush,great quality.love it</li>
    <li> Replaced brushes on Oral-B toothbrush. Long overdue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these brushes for some time now and never could find them for a good price locally. When i found this post, I got both. Quick service at a better price.</li>
    <li> Product as expected. Glad I can get it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Genuine Oral B refills - work great</li>
    <li> Working as anticipated.  Brushes are nice and soft, which have not irritated my gums.</li>
    <li> These are the best. I have very sensitive gums and these are very gentle on them but still get my teeth clean. I have never had a cavity in my permanent teeth and have been using these for years. My dentist is always happy with my teeth.</li>
    <li> I clicked on &#x27;buy with one click&#x27; when I saw that this product was 6 or 7 dollars cheaper on-line than in the drugstore--without checking the old, &#x27;shipping and handling&#x27; dodge. So with the pricey shipping in handling I saved 50 cents. Been awhile since I fell for that one; I&#x27;ve just hated how much these stupid refills cost. they should cost a few bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a convenient way to buy these things, if you don&#x27;t get out much, I guess. Not a huge savings though.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re just right for me.</li>
    <li> Fine product.  Just what we expected.  Works great.  Much less expensive than the similar power brush that we had before.</li>
    <li> I expected to have a  massage setting and a  timer device indicator for brushing length. Also a charging indicator included.</li>
    <li> just what my teeth needed to reduce abrasion and hopefully stop receding my gums.</li>
    <li> The order was delivered as promised.  I was very relieved the brushes fit my tooth brush as it is very old.  The brushes do a nice job of cleaning my sensitive teeth with no problems noted.</li>
    <li> Good standard product and much less expensive at Amazon!</li>
    <li> These were purchased as replacements for an Oral-B toothbrush.  I had read a few complaints in other reviews about fit and quality, but these seem to be exactly the same as those I have purchased for years, and I have never had any problems.  The toothbrush handle itself is over a decade old, has been in use twice daily since its purchase, and seems to work as well as when I first got it.  The seems remarkable for a rechargeable battery operated device.  The battery is a NiMH so that may explain its longevity.</li>
    <li> These brush heads are much better than the &amp;#34;Flossing&amp;#34; one that came with my Oral-B toothbrush (Prowhite Precision 4000 Rechargeable). These don&#x27;t hurt my gums and I like them. You have to buy replacements every three months anyway, so if the brush head you&#x27;re using hurts your gums, try these. They are gentler.</li>
    <li> My mother-in-law is a dental hygienist and suggested we buy this for our son who likes our tooth brush.  He uses this on his teeth and we have had no issue with gum sensitivity.</li>
    <li> I use the Sensitive brush head and the Gentle cycle on my Oral-B Professional 5000 and love the awesome clean feeling.  My gums and teeth are easily irritated but I haven&#x27;t had any problems while using this brush.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive gums that bleed a lot when I brush my teeth.  This product has worked the best.  There is still some bleeding but not the pain.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I recommend it without reservation. These brush heads are a BIG improvement over the regular model.</li>
    <li> it does a very good job in cleaning the teeth and more importantly it is kind to the gums and much less abrasive to the teeth.  clean but save the enamel.  pricey though.</li>
    <li> This is not some knock-off.  These are the genuine thing.  They are much softer then that original brush.</li>
    <li> Arrived the next day.  Just perfect.</li>
    <li> It came in on time and it is a quality product.</li>
    <li> as advertised and reviewed  I would recommend for all with sensitive teeth or worried about loss of enamel from harder brushes</li>
    <li> My dentist urged me to get these and I am thankful I have because it has led me to better brushing focus on the areas where teeth and gums meet.  As a result the health of my gums has improved.</li>
    <li> These replacement heads are great for people with sensitive gums. I&#x27;ve always found the regular heads a tad harsh. These clean just as well as the regular heads. Great for kids too.</li>
    <li> oral b sensitive extra soft brush heads,&lt;br /&gt;the kind I need and very good.  we can only get them on line now.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product from Australia to be used in Australia. No where in the description of the item did it mention the type of power needed to charge the toothbrush nor were there options on the order form. I would have liked to know what plug type and what power was needed. When I wrote to ask if I could use my converter plug and 2540v power, I was referred to Oral B, who referred me to Proctor and Gamble who referred me back to Amazon. No where on the outside of the box it came in are plug or power mentioned. The instructions are in French and English so I assumed it would work when I opened it up. My dentist recommended this toothbrush and I was excited Amazon had it, it&#x27;s supposed to be good.</li>
    <li> Two thumbs up on this product.  I have very sensitive gums and Oral-B Extra Soft Brush feels light as a feather going across my gums no matter the pressure and yet cleans my teeth wonderfully.  This product is the best and I would recommend it to anyone who has extremely sensitive gums.</li>
    <li> Have been using  these for about five years now and they do an excellent job when brushing. Not too soft and perfect for my use. If you try them I am sure you will agree. Fast delivery too.</li>
    <li> These toothbrush heads are being sold for much more than the soft bristle heads and there isn&#x27;t a reduction at all by buying on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are already showing wear after less than a month of use.  Couldn&#x27;t you find a material to use that will provide a very soft bristle without being so expensive?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could buy the whole toothbrush with a brush head on it and an additional brush head for the price of just 3 heads.</li>
    <li> The oral B system does an excellent job of cleaning my teeth. I chose the sensitive teeth version due to receding gums.&lt;br /&gt;Like regular brushing, you have to replace the brushes every three months.&lt;br /&gt;I switched from manual to electric brushing because of tendinitis in my dominant hand. The tendinitis is gone but I&#x27;m sticking with the toothbrush.</li>
    <li> These are the best toothbrush heads for sensitive teeth and gums!&lt;br /&gt;Regular, gentle brushing with these special spinning brush heads, will become the most comfortable teeth routine you&#x27;ll enjoy. I won&#x27;t brush with any other!</li>
    <li> This product works as expected and is well built.</li>
    <li> I purchased these at the recommendation of my dentist.  I had gum surgery a few years ago, so I try to be careful, and these extra-soft brush heads are extremely gentle while still doing what they need to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually switch to a new brush head every other month, so a package of 3 will last me 6 months.  I use this Oral-B toothbrush [[ASIN:B002HWS9GG Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Floss Action Precision 5000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush(packaging may vary)]] , and this brush head fits fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked these so much I now have them on subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> It does not feel very much softer, if at all, than the regular one. Still feels hard on my teeth.</li>
    <li> Great brush heads for sensitive teeth. Still get a nice clean feeling with these</li>
    <li> I have sensitive gums and am so glad I bought these extras.  They don&#x27;t feel too flimsy but are soft and feel very good.  I get a great clean with my new toothbrush and heads.  I recommend.</li>
    <li> These work great. Good quality construction. I had bought some cheaper ones once and the bristles began to fall out. These were definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great price; love to get these needed refills online at Amazon; these sensitive are always better for my sensitive teeth and clean well</li>
    <li> Functioning as expected.</li>
    <li> I would not be without my Oral B electric toothbrush and I use if daily and a couple of times daily.</li>
    <li> I need a brush with a soft bristle for sensitive teeth.  They still seem expensive to me, but the cheaper ones reportedly don&#x27;t hold up.  I like the Oral -B brand.  It works well and is better priced then some.  I have had the brush for several years without any problems.</li>
    <li> I prefer these because they are gentle on the gums. Will purchase more in the future. Excellent value when they go on sale.</li>
    <li> These appear to be original Oral-B brushes like they sell in the stores at twice this price.  They work fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just learning about battery-operated toothbrushes, and I have sensitive teeth, so I am happy to use these brush heads with my new Oral-B toothbrush.  They do the job painlessly.</li>
    <li> Great if you have sensitive or receding gum line.</li>
    <li> this is much better than the brushhead that came with the oral-b (flossing crossaction)... The other one was pretty abrasive and gumline recession is no fun!</li>
    <li> Small, circular head cleans between teeth. Fits better in your mouth than a rectangular head. Massages gums while you brush. Better than the one my dentist sold me for $160.00.</li>
    <li> These brush heads typically run about $20 for a set of 3, so the Amazon price of under $11 for a set was a real steal.  I&#x27;m definitely keeping my eyes open for a bargain like this again.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and very nice quality.</li>
    <li> These are the soft brissel brushes I was looking for</li>
    <li> Tried generic brushes.  Oral B&#x27;s are a bit costly, but work much better than generics....</li>
    <li> great brushes that do the job of cleaning our teeth.  Continue to have trust in Oral B products and water piks.</li>
    <li> I agree that these are a little pricey, but well worth it. I think the softer heads work better than the firmer heads included with the brush handle. They especially do great on the back side of molars. I am very pleased with results. Also, experience teaches that these last a long time. Eventually (3 to 6 months maybe) they get a little bit &amp;#34;loose&amp;#34; in the mechanical parts and you can tell that the vibrations are no long as good as they should be. Even then, they seem to clean better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are using a cheap AA battery unit then I highly recommend you stop. Get the Oral-B handle and order a pack of these to use instead.</li>
    <li> It is best to use Oral B replacement brushes rather than cheaper ones available.  The tips are rounded and they last longer.  I tried the cheaper ones and they fell apart.  Shop local drugstores for them to avoid shipping charges.</li>
    <li> I bought these because the brush that came with my new Oral-B Pro 1000 was too hard on some of my gums.  Unfortunately, these aren&#x27;t tough enough to really get in and clean my permanent retainer and they&#x27;re a little wimpy for brushing my tongue.  So now I have to switch out brushes for my different needs.</li>
    <li> Soft and does not hurt the gums!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality replacement brushes.  It&#x27;s difficult to find the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; brushes, let alone for a good price.  They also fit my older model Braun Professional Care electric toothbrush perfectly!</li>
    <li> great price for 3 new heads.</li>
    <li> These heads are not much softer than the regular ones and they get worn out after just a couple months of brushing, from my experience.</li>
    <li> I wont use anything but Oral B. I have very sensitive gums and teeth and these heads are perfect for what I need.</li>
    <li> nothing exciting here, the less you pay for it the happier you will be.  I prefer sensitive as my dentist has always recommended the softest brush possible.</li>
    <li> I like these brush heads just fine and they actually fit my approximately twenty year old Braun tooth brush. Decent price, too.</li>
    <li> GREAT DENTAL CHECK-UP.  LESS PLAQUE</li>
    <li> These are great toothbrush replacement heads. Since I changed to the Sensitive type, my dental checkups have gone much better and I&#x27;ve saved lots of money by being able to have my teeth cleaned less often.</li>
    <li> Too expensive! Over $6.00 per tiny toothbrush head the size of a pinky nail.</li>
    <li> I have utilized the regular heads, and they were very tough on my sensitive gums.  The Sensitive heads make a world of difference.  Don&#x27;t give up on your Oral-B electronic toothbrush without trying the sensitive heads, which are hard to find at retail.</li>
    <li> I like the sensitive toothbrush heads better then the regular ones. The regular ones hurt my gums, especially when they are new.</li>
    <li> Why don&#x27;t they sell those brushes in stores??? These are the one highly recommended by dentists for people with weak/bleeding gums.</li>
    <li> Im a dentist and fairly picky about my brushes. I love these heads. They are the only ones I like.</li>
    <li> These came to good use and they help you get a good clean mouth every time you brush. They are different in that they have a different brissel pattern and they help clean different areas of the teeth.</li>
    <li> We prefer the extra soft brushes as they are easier on the gums. And they last for a fairly long time.</li>
    <li> These sensitive brush heads are great for cleaning tender teeth.  They go in a circle so when your hand goes up and down, you get double action.</li>
    <li> These are expensive in stores.  I found here a little cheaper price, but quality is good and accurately described.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Soft bristles , just what i wanted, anyone with a sensetive mouth or especially sensitive gums will know that its hard to find the right balance of soft bristles that are firm enough to make sure it gets the job done. These heads certainly deliver on that front, I have used them ever since and will always keep some handy, dont think i have found any other tooth brush that works for me as well with these heads.</li>
    <li> We love the Oral-B toothbrush and these extra-soft brush heads are perfect for this toothbrush.  They are very gentle but still provide a complete cleaning.  Our only complaint is that the brush heads are getting expensive.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both use our Oral-B electric tooth brush.  As we get older (and my husband takes blood thinners) our gums and teeth become more sensitive.  The extra-soft brush heads are gentle and just what the dentist advised.  How great to be able to find them on Amazon and delivered right to my mailbox.  I love Amazon Prime.  It has paid for lots of shipping on my purchases.&lt;br /&gt;Ruth Ward</li>
    <li> The Oral-B Triumph electric toothbrush is great beyond excellent.  I prefer the round style which rotates, over the &amp;#34;up and down&amp;#34; competition electric brush because I feel I have more control.  The Sensitive brush is designed for those with sensitive gums.</li>
    <li> My favourite ever, keeps teeth clean while maintaining gum&#x27;s health with no harm done to as in the case of other brush</li>
    <li> I had been using the dual-clean heads which are much bigger and, I thought, more thorough. However, my dentist told me that I was overbrushing so I thought maybe switching to the sensitive head would be better for my gums. At first, the vastly smaller size made me feel like it was ineffective, but I actually think it forces me to focus on brushing each tooth/gum and also helps with the timer because I actually spend a few second on each tooth which takes me the full two minutes. I don&#x27;t feel like I am pointlessly allowing the brush to hover aimlessly (which happened with the dual clean because its coverage area was so large that it felt pointless to brush for that long).</li>
    <li> This product lasts for 3-4 four months. I usually replace every three months. These brush heads do not wear out like other &amp;#34;Oral-B&amp;#34; compatible products I used in the past.</li>
    <li> Extra soft bristles are easy on the teeth and gums.  Much better value here than in stores.  Almost a full $10 cheaper on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great brush heads for a great price!</li>
    <li> I have used this brush for many years, never had any problems with it.  It really helps when you visit your dentist.</li>
    <li> These heads fit on a basic oral B electric tooth brush.  They are soft enough not to bruise the gums but stiff enough to do a thorough job of cleaning all teeth.</li>
    <li> The Oral-B sensitive head is great for getting in and around all the tight spaces in your mouth without tearing up your gums.  My dentist is always harping on me to use sensitive brushes to protect my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I started using these compact heads, my dentist tells me that I have exceptionally clean teeth.  I think this is because the tiny head on these brushes can even get behind my wisdom teeth where a normal, larger headed brush couldn&#x27;t reach.</li>
    <li> So excited to find them at such a great price.  It has been becoming more and more difficult to find them in the stores locally for sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> The brush is great for our sensitive  teeth and does an excellent job of cleaning them as well.&lt;br /&gt;We can highly  recommend  it.</li>
    <li> Delicious, I can now change my 6 month old head.  Teeth feel all clean n stuff, my wife kisses me again... I should get her one too.</li>
    <li> The replacement brush heads fit exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Our purchase arrived in good condition.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> If you need the sensitive brush heads, this is what you need. When I use a new one, I run hot water over it for a few seconds for the first few uses to make the bristles a bit softer.</li>
    <li> The sensitive head is so much nicer to my gums and teeth than the floss action. Even though I&#x27;m in the dental profession, I&#x27;ll stick to flossing with string!</li>
    <li> ...and gets into those hard to reach places due to the size of the head.  Brushes are soft and leave your teeth feeling brand new.</li>
    <li> I bought these after finding the standard brush heads a bit &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34; and am very pleased with the purchased. The heads are much more gentle on teeth and gums while still leaving you wish a very clean feeling after brushing. I also appreciated the subscription which I signed-up for as there was a coupon that was automatically applied to my order resulting in a much better price.</li>
    <li> Although these brush heads are marketed as extra-soft, they also seem to cup my teeth better than the other brush heads.  They do a very good job of brushing my teeth.</li>
    <li> Genuine replacement, works fine.</li>
    <li> I got this soft toothbrush because I was hoping it would do a better job of cleaning my teeth, and getting into the nooks and crannies. It seems to be at least on par with my previous harder oral-b brush, but I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s doing a better job yet.</li>
    <li> It feels nice and soft against teeth &amp; gums. Leaves your teeth clean like if you left the dentist office.</li>
    <li> I bought this soft toothbrush  head because my teeth is getting very sensitive. The bush is very gentle on the gum line and still keep my teeth clean. The head is small enough that it reaches all the teeth inside my mouth, especially the ones in the back. You do get three toothbrush head in the pack.  All in all it&#x27;s get the job done so I don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
    <li> I just bought my first electronic toothbrush and bought these for at least the beginning. Highly recommended - electronic toothbrushes take a little time to get used to, these brushes make it natural! I&#x27;m about to switch to the regulars now:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these brush heads for several months now and they do a great job (while still leaving some enamel on my teeth).  Amazon shipped them promptly &amp; there were no problems.  I&#x27;ve read some unhappy reviews on brush heads that apparently seem to be the same thing, but turn out not to be quite the same.  So just be sure that, out of the plethora of brush heads, you choose the genuine Oral-B brand and that they&#x27;re shipped &amp; sold by Amazon.</li>
    <li> had gum surgery and dentist recommended i use electrical with soft bristles to prevent from receding again... its been two years and doc said my gums are doing great ...</li>
    <li> Great deal! Most Oral Br products don&#x27;t come with more than one head, so this is a bargain purchase and means that everyone in your family can have their own toothbrush head.</li>
    <li> They work very well and hold up over time just have to remember to replace when they still look good.</li>
    <li> These brushes are nice and sensitive...but I found that they also clean my teeth poorly. I won&#x27;t be using them again.</li>
    <li> I like them. I got them for my kid&#x27;s first electric brush. They are soft. Just what I was looking for. I don&#x27;t anticipate them to last as long as other brush heads though (because they are soft).</li>
    <li> My son like this oral-b sensitive brush heads although it is not cheap. It is a big benefit to my son&#x27;s tooth . I will recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> Using Oral-B Sensitive brush heads has improved ny dental health as well as reducing the wear and tear on my gums that a regular brush would produce.It was great to be able to buy this online!LOVE Amazon Prime!</li>
    <li> These heads are great for my sensitive teeth.  I tried others, but these work best for me.  They also lose their color over time, to remind you to toss it and put on a new one!</li>
    <li> These are gentle on my teeth and gums but effective in cleaning.</li>
    <li> To add to the longevity of the cleaning / brushing that is offered by the Oral B Toothbrush, these brush heads were purchased also.  So far, so good.</li>
    <li> I have had gum disease and been recommended by my dentist to use a soft tooth brush. I really LOVE this toothbrush! I can brush my teeth without having the brush tear up my gums. My teeth feel totally clean when I do that. I have been using Tom&#x27;s Sensitive tooth paste but am thinking about switching to Organic Coconut Oil. What ever I do, it will be with my Oral B electric tooth brush and the Oral B Sensitive head!</li>
    <li> My dentist swears by nothing else but for the family to use Oral -B electric toothbrushes. I purchased these extra ones for my kit.  They will last three months. The only thing I wish they did was offer more colors to help us distinguish between the brushes. Our set was full of pink!</li>
    <li> A good product.  My former dentist suggested &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; replacement heads. Works well.</li>
    <li> I was using Oral-B \\&quot;Precision Clean\\&quot; heads for a long time. I used to buy this type, because this was the only choice that I could find in the retail stores. Usually, \\&quot;Dual Clean\\&quot; heads also were available, but I do not like them. They are just so big. I wanted to switch to another type, and I did a little research. I found Oral-B \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; heads, and I found good reviews on this product. I am using this heads for a few weeks now. I bought this product because it probably has the highest bristle density, and the bristles are extra soft so they are very gentle on the gum. In my opinion, they do a very good job. I feel that they clean better than \\&quot;Precision Clean\\&quot; heads. I use HydroFloss after brushing. When I was using \\&quot;Precision Clean,\\&quot; I used to still see some stuff coming out of the area between my teeth during cleaning with HydroFloss. However, this stopped when I switched to \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; heads. I feel that \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; head is cleaning better. It is also more gentle on my gum.</li>
    <li> Works as well as expected.</li>
    <li> For years I used floss and a somewhat  soft manual toothbrush, and plaque tended to collect in spite of flossing.  Now this brush seems to really remove all that as I concentrate the brush more to my gumline.  The difference is very noticeable to my hygienist and to me.</li>
    <li> just what I have been trying to find, always hard to find the extra-soft brush heads in stores. Recommend to anyone with sensitive teeth who uses an electric toothbrush</li>
    <li> These tooth brush heads appear to work well, but they&#x27;re a little loose for the Oral-B toothbrush and fall off as you&#x27;re brushing.  They work fine if slightly upright, but that&#x27;s impractical as you try to brush your teeth.</li>
    <li> They work fine, just the way you&#x27;d expect. It&#x27;s a tooth brush, what can you say about a tooth brush.</li>
    <li> Oral B Power Sensitive replacement electric toothbrushes are the only ones of their kind I use. the key word is SENSITIVE, as one can use them freely to massage the gums without causing any inflammation and you can actually push the bristles between your teeth without damaging your gums. my teeth feel clean as glass after I use them and for bleeding gums, that thorough massage is wonderful</li>
    <li> The other brushes that come with the oral b brushes seem to be to harsh for my gums. This also seems to clean better.</li>
    <li> The bristles are soft on this brush, and they spin in circular action.  This met all my expectations of a toothbrush.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only brush I can use. I have several sensitive  teeth. I have tried the new ones and they hurt my teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> These brush heads provide safe, thorough, gentle cleaning for sensitive teeth and gums.  I recommend for anyone fighting gum disease.</li>
    <li> This my second one the other  wore out.  It does a good job for me</li>
    <li> good price and good delivery.</li>
    <li> I have gum problems and wanted to tried a new toothbrush. I was glad to have found an affordable toothbrush for sensitive teeth and extra soft brush head. However, I don&#x27;t think the brush is as soft as described.</li>
    <li> Like always, these are the best for me.  I have sensitive teeth so I prefer the soft brushes rather than something else.  Expensive but....they are worth it and to buy them elsewhere, it&#x27;s gonna be MORE expensive so either way, I get what I want and I&#x27;m satisfied.  I would recommend these regardless of how your teeth feel, the softer the better.  It&#x27;s better for your teeth...anyway....!!</li>
    <li> These soft brush heads are perfect for my sensitive gums. They gently brush away the food and tartar on my teeth. And they&#x27;re awesome!</li>
    <li> Just as advertised its amazing! I brush my teeth more now than ever because its so enjoyable. Looking forward to trying other brush heads now.</li>
    <li> I am a dentist, and I really like this tip for my electric toothbrush. The soft bristles allow me to work them in between the teeth without damaging the soft tissues. I have them on automatic order from Amazon!</li>
    <li> I enjoyed these brush heads. Very soft. And work pretty well so far. Will buy again later, when I need to.</li>
    <li> My wife needs soft toothbrushes and these fit the bill.  Amazon does not have them available now.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if these were going to be too soft but that has not been the case. These leave your teeth feeling very cleaning, not to hard, just right.</li>
    <li> Good value for the price. These are very reasonable and works well with my oral b electrical toothbrush. Also make sure you change the brush when it turns color.</li>
    <li> This product  is great for people with sensitive teeth &amp; gum problems.&lt;br /&gt;Does the cleaning without irritating gum tissue.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to use this product !!!</li>
    <li> I love my Oral-B toothbrush..... would not be without it. I am very serious about cleaning my teeth&lt;br /&gt;and this brush unit helps me clean the best that I can without going to the dentist office. It is the&lt;br /&gt;reason I get great check ups at the dentist office.</li>
    <li> My teeth are very sensitive and I have no trouble with this the way I did with the other styles. It&#x27;s a good price thru Amazon. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> The bristles are super soft, which is awesome.  I worry less about gingival recession or enamel erosion now.</li>
    <li> These are the exact heads I need, but couldn&#x27;t find in the local stores.  Everyone has soft or medium etc, but not the extra soft which my dentist recommends I use.</li>
    <li> When i had moved in with my gf, she had brought along one of those cheap Oral-B Vitality Electric Toothbrushes. She had purchased a three pack of the floss action heads, so i decided to use it to keep up with my teeth hygiene. Well my background is using the sensitive function on a more expensive Oral-B electric toothbrush. Well let me just say that that experience was well learned and a lesson that i learned that i needed a sensitive tooth brush head. The Oral-B only has an on and off function, so there is no calming down the motor in it. The floss action was just to hard on my teeth. I am a young guy, but i am just so blessed with sensitive teeth. So i decided to purchase this through amazon since this was the best price around. When i got it i went home after work and tried it out. Wow what a difference between this and the floss action, as well as just a manual toothbrush. I didnt get any pains at all from using it, and now several weeks in and still no side effects from using it. I can now truly appreciate the cleaning power of the toothbrush itself. I would totally recommend this to anyone who cannot afford one of the high end electric toothbrushes with a sensitive mode.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and fine quality</li>
    <li> Good brushes and not too expensive.</li>
    <li> Works great with my toothbrush - very soft but you still get a good &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling after use. Much softer than the standard brush head that originally came with my toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Works well.  My kids are the uses of it.  Much easier to brush with than a manual.</li>
    <li> great for sensitive gums</li>
    <li> It is VERY soft. So if you have problems with gums, you can still use your electric brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like it, because i don&#x27;t have that problems. I&#x27;ve bought it just to compare with another brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have no problems with gums, it&#x27;s better for you to buy Floss Action or Prowhite.</li>
    <li> Impossible to find these soft brush replacement heads in retail stores. Great price- exactly what I need.</li>
    <li> I have a new Oral B electric tooth brush and the brushes that came with the unit were way to stiff for my sensitive teeth. These replacment sensitive are well worth the price and are a great value for a three pack.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for! Asking speaking with my dentist and they recommending the Oral-B Professional Precision 5000, I found that I needed a much softer brush head than the ones that comes standard. These were gentle on my gum line and you can definitely still feel the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; that your standard brush head will give you. Highly recommend to those with sensitive teeth or residing gum line.</li>
    <li> My wife loves these in place of the standard brushes. These work extremely well if you have sensitive gums.</li>
    <li> Using now for 5 years. The best money can buy.</li>
    <li> I love these brush heads!  My dentist told me my gums are starting to recede and I need a soft toothbrush head.  These are perfect for getting my teeth super clean without making my gums worse.  Shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> My husband has sensitive gums and loves these.  Will definitely be ordering these again.</li>
    <li> Fit my unit perfectly even though the number wasn&#x27;t listed.</li>
    <li> As much as l like the idea of My Oral B brush,the brushes I had were too stiff and they bothered my teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;This is a softer bristle for my sensitive gum area. I use it every evening and it seems to be clener than a brush and softer and more comfortable than the other brushes that came with my unit.&lt;br /&gt;I like this product and recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love my Oral-B and I love this brush head!  I don&#x27;t feel like it is too harsh on my gums and teeth yet I feel like a have clean teeth.</li>
    <li> Arrived in record time, in great packaging. Very happy with this product. Soft on the teeth, perfect for reaching between teeth. Great toothbrush replacement.</li>
    <li> over Priced  I guess your paying for the  name</li>
    <li> These heads are very soft on your teeth and gums.  I prefer these to the other Oral B heads.  They still do a great job cleaning.</li>
    <li> This brush is soft enough for sensitive teeth, something which had deterred me from buying an electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I am very glad to have ordered these brushes.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. I try my best to always do my shopping with amazon. best way to shop.</li>
    <li> It does not fit the Sonic Complete.  Product summary should have stated which tooth brushes the replacement heads would not fit.</li>
    <li> I always use these brush heads and can only get them on line.  They are hard to find in the stores.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re good but I wish they would hold up better and last longer.</li>
    <li> Our dentist recommended this product to us.  It cleans well and leaves my mouth feeling fresh.  I would recommend it  to anyone.</li>
    <li> So I purchased them onlline.&lt;br /&gt;the outside bristles seem to be as soft as the dentist recomended.&lt;br /&gt;the inner bristles though are medium, so you have to make sure you don&#x27;t apply too much pressure to prevent the medium bristles from hitting your gum line.</li>
    <li> We loves Oral B, so this a purchase we use to buy, easy and very soft.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT MY ORAL B NEW BLACK TOOTHBRUSH BY ORAL B THAT HAS BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY.&lt;br /&gt;AND LOVE IT. (bought on Amazon of course).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD RECOMMEND THE &amp;#34;SENSITIVE&amp;#34; TOOTHBRUSH FOR PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF THAT HAD BRACES, AND NOW WEAR  A PERMANENT WIRE RETAINER.

    <li> This is the only place I have found the proper brush replacements for my Oral-B.  Thank You.</li>
    <li> good as ever, thank you</li>
    <li> I use nothing else.  Great job and don&#x27;t wear down your gums.</li>
    <li> great prduct at great price.</li>
    <li> Much softer than the regular Oral-B head.  Just what I needed.</li>
    <li> I reviewed which was the best power toothbrush.  I have the other top rated, and got this for my wife.  I think this is better than the other brand I have.  Better cleaning, circular motion.  A little louder, but not bad.  It came with multiple heads to try out.  Would buy one for myself when mine needs to be replaced</li>
    <li> these are excellent for someone with sensitive gums like me.  The last a long time, too.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed - they lasted 3 months + just like information said.  Cheaper than in store unless there is a coupon.</li>
    <li> I really like the soft brushes as they save the enamel on my teeth.  I tent to be a bit aggressive when brushing so these are perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Like extra soft brushes so this is the answer for me.</li>
    <li> I have a problem with receding gums (I&#x27;m an &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; brusher) and this brush head is perfect -- soft and gentle on your gums but gets your teeth clean.</li>
    <li> The heads work as expected . Great product fits well to the Oral B Toothbrush. A little still on the high end of the price point though, I did find others cheaper</li>
    <li> These are working great for me.  I stopped buying the generics because they don&#x27;t last. I&#x27;m very satisfied with these.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive gums that like to recede and sensitive nerves when my sinuses are bothering me. I had stopped using an electric toothbrush entirely until I found the Oral-B Sensitive and these toothbrush heads. Now I feel ZERO pain! I highly recommend splurging on these brush heads.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t need a new toothbrush as long as I can get these replacement brushes.  I get a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; toothbrush every month.</li>
    <li> These brushes are nice and even and are much better than the original brush that came with the Precision 3000.</li>
    <li> Nice price for the brushes. They arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Have been using this item for years. The extra soft is great for gums.</li>
    <li> A must have for anyone with sensitive gums &amp; teeth</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist recommended a softer toothbrush for me, so I was happy to find this. Use-wise, it feels like it&#x27;s not too soft, and gives just enough so it cleans my mouth well. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Love my electric toothbrush, and these replacements fit so that fills all my needs.  Five stars.</li>
    <li> Need these to clean under bonded wire</li>
    <li> I wish these were cheaper.they work well though</li>
    <li> These are the ones that my dentist recommends and I believe that she knows what she is talking about.</li>
    <li> Great! Just what the doctor ordered!</li>
    <li> So glad I bought these with my Oral B purchase.  Nice to not have to worry about trying to find them in the store.  Also a better price through Amazon.  Shipped quickly and have a nice clean storage box.&lt;br /&gt;If your buying an Oral B..be sure to grab these now or if you already own one... these are a wonderful price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love having the extra heads.  Even if I won&#x27;t share!!</li>
    <li> Have to use extra soft manual toothbrushes so was very glad to find these as I love to use an electric toothbrush but didn&#x27;t want to risk injuring my gums more by continuing to use regular heads. These work great and feel like they get my teeth just as clean as &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; heads I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
    <li> Works great and is soft so it does not hurt my gums.</li>
    <li> I bought the Oral-b Profession Healthy Rechargeable electric toothbrush but I was concerned about the brush that came with&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it.  I have &amp;#34;fragile&amp;#34; teeth and the soft brushes are really very helpful.</li>
    <li> These are just like the ones that came on the brush when I bought it.  They work. They are soft enough to win my dentist&#x27;s approval and not tear apart my gums. It is just a shame that they are such an outrageous price - are they being phased out or something?</li>
    <li> This is the product recommended by my dentist.  It cleans my teeth and mouth in complete fashion.  No need for the exotic shapes and features of other electric brushes.  Dental floss is still needed.</li>
    <li> While I have not used any of these brush heads, they are like the one which came on my new Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000 rechargeable electric unit. The brush on the unit performs very well, so I anticipate these brush heads will do likewise.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these.  They clean my teeth extremely well.  I don&#x27;t need to purchase teeth whitener, because these do the trick.  I was really surprised about that.  They feel nice and leave my teeth feeling super clean.  There is no comparison to a regular tooth brush.  These clean your teeth ten times better and faster than any regular tooth brush ever will.</li>
    <li> I have used these brushes for several years and they do a great job of cleaning my teeth. I will continue to buy them</li>
    <li> Once I purchased these on e-bay and they looked like the authentic replacements but were much cheaper and a small plastic part broke almost immediately. These on Amazon are fine. Thanks, Amazon.</li>
    <li> The replacement brushes fit my Brush/Braun machine allowing me to have replacements handy when the brush indicator reveals that replacement is due.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush head is soft and excellent for the gum areas as well as the teeth. A good price (locally they are with $10 more) for the sake of your oral health.</li>
    <li> I like these heads the most from the others but it&#x27;s best to buy all the different kinds and then decide which is best for your teeth as we all have different ones...</li>
    <li> They work really well, but I wish they were cheaper!  These are for sensitive teeth and gums and they are gentle!</li>
    <li> Very soft brush heads. Really good for sensitive tooth.</li>
    <li> Love it! I bought a generic replacement awhile ago and had to dump it right after 1 usage as it&#x27;s never the same compared to the original one. This one makes my gum feels good as its soft, but it&#x27;s hard enough to make my teeth clean. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> These are my favorite for sensitive mouths and the price is great.</li>
    <li> I really like the soft brush heads. They fit on the toothbrush much easier than generic heads that I bought at a store. Price and delivery were good.</li>
    <li> I just received the oral-b as a gift.  It came with a much stiffer brush which my mouth did not like, so I purchased these soft bristle heads.  I love them!  Perhaps when my mouth and teeth adjust and get used to the action, I&#x27;ll return to the stiffer bristle heads, but for now these are working great and my teeth feel fabulous after brushing.</li>
    <li> This works well for most users. My wife and I have tried the other styles of brushheads and she complained that some of them were too bulky and made it difficult for her to reach her back teeth. These are just the right size.</li>
    <li> Best one, hard to get in stores now.</li>
    <li> I needed to get some extra brushes for my [[ASIN:B003UKKHB4 Oral-b 3000 Professional Care 3000 Electric Toothbrush]] so after looking at them in store and getting sticker shock I decided to check out Amazon.  I was happy to find them here for 50% less and on Subscribe &amp; Save too.  Not much I can say other than they work as expected and they are the sensitive extra-soft head which is my preference.  I will continue to purchase them here on Amazon as long as they are competitive in their pricing.</li>
    <li> My brushes were as expected.  Extra soft brushes are not as \\&quot;soft\\&quot; as I would like them to be, but definitely softer than the regular heads.  I have found that with any toothbrush, that if you hold them under running hot water, it helps to soften them up a bit more.</li>
    <li> The Brush heads arrived quickly , they where at a much lower price than the local discount store and they where original Oral-B brushes .What else can you ask for great price , good service and a great product. The Brush heads are soft but not to soft they do a good job cleaning your teeth and add Sensodyne tooth paste you have a winning combination for sensitive teeth . I would order this product from Amazon.com again  in a heart beat .</li>
    <li> the product is what was expected. that says it all. it&#x27;s not for shining shoes please stop and send it</li>
    <li> If you have gum disease (or just sensitive gums), these are great. They clean your teeth well, without causing bleeding or discomfort.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist recommended a soft bristled head so it wouldn&#x27;t damage my gums.  I really like it as well as a polisher head to keep coffee from staining my teeth.  Great item.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Braun electric toothbrush for years, and have had excellent results.  This brush head gives my teeth a very clean feeling, and I can reach way back to the hard to get teeth.&lt;br /&gt;And as usual, Amazon Prime shipping is the best!</li>
    <li> Extra soft brushes are hard to find.  These work perfectly for receding gums.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 89 years old without a cavity or filling in my mouth and I still have my naturally grown teeth.  I used to have to go to the dentist twice a year to have my teeth cleaned and remove the tarter from between them.  A dentist friend suggested the Electric Oral B Tooth Brush and the Sensitive replaceable brushes.  That was 35 years ago and I haven&#x27;t had tarter that needed a dentist to remove since.  His advice plus brushing after every meal and at bedtime was right on.  Try getting them from Amazon and see if I am right.</li>
    <li> Great buy. Real money saver.</li>
    <li> Very good cleaning with these yet gentle enough not to irritate my very tender gums. Pricing is so much better than in store even with coupon.</li>
    <li> These toothbrush heads are great and gentle to the teeth.  Were delivered promptly and will continue to purchase the Oral B Sensitive toothbrush head replacements.</li>
    <li> I bought these for $13 incl. shipping so that was a great deal. I received the extra soft heads like I ordered. The brushheads work great with no issues. If you&#x27;re thinking about saving a few bucks by buying the generic ones at walmart, don&#x27;t. I did and they are not the same and are vastly inferior. They had a strong vibration to them that actually hurt my teeth and gums and were a lot noisier. Going back to the official heads made me appreciate how quiet and smooth the brush and handle operated.</li>
    <li> I have extra sensitive teeth and suffer from genetic recession on my teeth so have to be careful about what brushes I use.  I like that these are soft but they are so soft that my teeth sometimes still feel like they are &#x27;wearing sweaters&#x27; even after I brush them.</li>
    <li> These brush heads are small enough and soft enough to clean the little curves of my teeth without pushing the gums away from the teeth. It keeps my smile Healthy, feeling good &amp; looking younger  My dentist says to brush my teeth as gently as if i were cleaning a strand of pearls. I get compliments on my smile when I&#x27;m out and about &amp; good checkups at the dentist office. Best of both worlds.</li>
    <li> Like these very well because not rough on gums in use. Seems they need to be replaced a little sooner than some of the harder bristle ones.</li>
    <li> Very good buy.  Arrived in good shape and received pretty quickly.  Very much worth the price (These are generally expensive to replace.)  I am glad there are places from which I can order and count on getting good, original products.</li>
    <li> I bought the wrong product.  Have a Sonicare, not an Oral B.</li>
    <li> great price and quick delivery</li>
    <li> I love these.  First of all, i finally figured out that, for best performance, you have to stay with the Oral B heads and NOT use the knock-offs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These aren&#x27;t as soft as they make them sound.  They perfect.  you can give your mouth a good scrubbing without doing damage from hard bristles.  I&#x27;ll never use anything else on my Oral B</li>
    <li> Been using the Oral B Professional electric tooth brush for many years and am always amazed at how long the machine has lasted.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the cost of the replacement heads.  How long the heads last is a matter of opinion, they lose their initial stiffness in a couple weeks, then takes a couple months for the blue to wear down.  When to actually swap it out is a matter of opinion.  Buying from Amazon is definitely the only way to go, in the local stores a 3 pack like this can go for over $30.</li>
    <li> Works well. Used it for years (needs to be replaced regularly)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize these came in extra-soft.  So much better on the gums.</li>
    <li> I have no issues with this product and the quality of the product holds up.  There is no need of worrying about product falling apart or not working.</li>
    <li> I really love the braun brush and the best part they give you 2-3 options  of brushes youll never get board</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist noticed how much better my homecare has been since I switched to the Oral-B toothbrush.  Because the brushheads are so gentle, I feared they were not cleaning as well, but to my extreme delight, my teeth are cleaner than ever - and this from one who always gets complimented for my home care by my dental professionals!</li>
    <li> Great product.  My teeth feel clean and shining.  The brush is very soft and perfect size for sensitive teeth product.</li>
    <li> WORK IN DENTISTRY- THIS IS WHAT WE RECOMMEND TO PATIENTS-GOOD PRICE</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome.  Gentle on the gums and yet it cleans great.</li>
    <li> better than any toothbrush</li>
    <li> Best for sensitive guns.</li>
    <li> perfect fit for my tooth brush.</li>
    <li> Perfect brush for good oral cleaning&lt;br /&gt;and not damage my gums!&lt;br /&gt;Frank C. Wilson</li>
    <li> dentist recommended.  Could not find anywhere else.  The drugstores often carry only their own house brands with just a few national brands.</li>
    <li> In typical fashion from Oral-B/Braun these are very good, they could be softer as calling them Extra-Soft is a little bit of a stretch. They are no where near as soft as Rotadent brushes which I would consider extra soft.</li>
    <li> Perfect for me and my family needs. Also, the price was right!!  I thank you for the great service and may GOD Bless you and GOD Bless America!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John 3:16</li>
    <li> After buying store brand brush heads labeled ok for my oral B toothbrush, I found they did not fit right. I decided I needed to buy the products own brand. The store brand did not fit correctly on the brush head and I wasn&#x27;t happy with the brushes themselves. This product fits and brushes the way my original heads did, and while I am sad I wasted $20.00 on the store brand, I am happy I invested the additional sum for these brushes.</li>
    <li> Dentists all over the country are recommending the Oral-B electric toothbrush.  There are several reasons.  It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, massaging your gums, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs.  This is a wonderful toothbrush, and I recommend it.  However, if you want a review of a toothbrush, you&#x27;ll read the toothbrush page.  This is a page for replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a lot of confusion about replacement heads for Oral B electric toothbrushes on Amazon, and I just want to give you all some facts.  There are only three kinds of heads for ALL Oral-B electric toothbrushes.  Flexisoft EB17, Extrasoft EB17, and Ortho OD17.  I prefer Flexisoft EB17 (The Extrasoft is a little too soft, and the Ortho is overpriced)&lt;br /&gt;What worries me about this listing is that it claims to be the Extrasoft EB17, but the picture of the item shows the Flexisoft EB17.  Be warned, Amazon might be confused about this item and selling it incorrectly labeled.  On the Extrasoft EB17, all the bristles around the outside edge are the same color.  If you&#x27;re looking for Extrasoft, make sure you find an item where the picture matches the description.</li>
    <li> Buying the name-brand is really worth it.  The cheap copies start to wiggle and almost fall apart in your mouth.  These seems safer for your teeth.</li>
    <li> Super soft replacement heads. Good for sensitive teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth and find that these help a lot in avoiding the pain brushing can cause. With the regular heads, I had more painful brushing. The floss type heads are out of the question for a pain-free yet effective brushing.</li>
    <li> I always buy Oral-B sensitive tooth brush heads for cleaning my teeth. I have been using them for years!  I change them every few months. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the colored tips that snap on the bottom.</li>
    <li> I had problems with soreness and bleeding when using regular soft tooth brushes.  Ended up trying the Oral-B toothbrush, with this extra soft brush head, and it works great.  no pain or bleeding, and still cleans teeth great.  If you have a similar problem with soreness or bleeding, I would also suggest that you use a toothpaste for sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> Very good mechanical toothbrush. I bought it to replace a previous one that stopped working after 3 yrs.</li>
    <li> On our (trusted) dentist&#x27;s recommendation, we have used these--sensitive, for years, now broaching decades.  The convenience, more than price advantage, compels us to purchase from Amazon.</li>
    <li> very good and easy to use</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush, especially if you have sensitive gums.</li>
    <li> This is perfect soft brush for my 2 year old daughter.</li>
    <li> I was an oral hygeniest in the military. We were taught that straight, soft toothbrushes like the old Oral-B 40&#x27;s were best. I actually switched to an electric toothbrush because manual toothbrushes now look and feel like something out of an S&amp;M nightmare. They remind me of a quote from the first three-blade razor commercial - \\&quot;Because you&#x27;ll buy anything.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brush heads are the best I&#x27;ve tried so far. I like them better than the flossing-action and the regular soft brush heads. As long as I can find them I&#x27;ll buy them. I had never seen them before I bought replacements this time.</li>
    <li> Everything is as expected.</li>
    <li> Great product. It&#x27;s really soft for my sensitive teeth!! I would buy this again for sure! I recommend this to everyone who has sensitive teeth</li>
    <li> Direct replacements. Work as they should.</li>
    <li> Brushes seem fine, I just wished these things got a bit cheaper. I do like the softer brushes since my gums don&#x27;t hurt when I brush now.</li>
    <li> This is my second order for the Oral-B Sensitive Extra Soft Brush heads from Amazon.com and I am very pleased with the whole process. Items were shipped in a timely manner and were received undamaged. Added bonus is the fact that these brush heads were a lot less expensive than in my local stores.</li>
    <li> &#x27;My wife loves her tooth brush and she loves the fact that she doesn&#x27;t have to worry about remember when buy replacement brush heads. haven&#x27;t had any issues with anything we&#x27;ve received from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best brush head Oral-B has to offer. It is soft enough to where it will not irritate your gums but will provide a great clean for your teeth.</li>
    <li> These are a workable, low price alternative to original equipment.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Because I have very sensitive teeth and gums I need a product such as this. I am not disappointed.</li>
    <li> These fit &amp; work perfectly &amp; the price was right.Very fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Good price on this product.</li>
    <li> Finding things like these toothbrush head replacements on Amazon is part of why I love this site. These heads are cheaper than you&#x27;ll find in the store, but of course the same quality. I liked the ones with the second head that moved up and down best for cleaning, but these are the next best thing and well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For people with sensitive teeth (and honestly anyone because you&#x27;re not supposed to scrub your teeth too hard when you brush) I&#x27;d recommend soft bristled toothbrushes like these.  I also purchased this toothpaste that&#x27;s all good ingredients for rebuilding your enamel and strengthening teeth (and actually doing it, not just using fluoride which is terrible for your teeth) [[ASIN:B00206DXQ0 Squigle Tooth Builder Sensitive Toothpaste (4 oz)]]</li>
    <li> The best way to brush your teeth.</li>
    <li> I bought my first electric toothbrush months ago and when I needed to get some replacement brush heads, I came to Amazon.  I have sensitive gums so I found these.  They work great.  Enough said.  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for a couple of years.  The soft brushes are better for dental care and really work for me.</li>
    <li> We switched from the Floss Action brush heads to these and are so glad we did!  These are so much gentler on my gums, but my teeth still feel just as great after a brushing.</li>
    <li> Unlike other items that popped up on a search for Oral-B toothbrush heads, these are real Oral-B quality and you can tell.</li>
    <li> Very good replacement tooth brushes for the oral-b.  I prefer the sensitive ones although they are all very good.  Does the job well and I highly recommend over standard brushes.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive gums and these brushes are perfect for me!  They clean thoroughly but gently.  I will keep buying them.</li>
    <li> I like that I can use it on maximum speed and feel almost nothing, which is good for sensitive gums and teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to verify with my hygienist that this is good for me.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the standard brush head, it feels a lot softer (although I&#x27;m not sure it cleans as well as the standard one).</li>
    <li> Sensitive teeth are not causing discomfort now.  I can eat hot or cold items and without pain.  Would recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> The Oral B round brushes makes my gums Happy!  i Love the soft smaller round heads for my sensitive gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
    <li> Love these! I&#x27;ve had this brush for years and I just tried the softer heads. Very happy with them.</li>
    <li> these are the best brush heads. Small enough to get everywhere. We don&#x27;t like the larger brushes as much.</li>
    <li> While it is said that the electric tooth brush doesn&#x27;t get your teeth any cleaner than the old hand brush, they do have the very important advantage of stimulating your gums! I use these extra soft brushes in mine so not to irritate my gums! Very comfortable!</li>
    <li> I switched to these rather than the generic ones Ive long been buying...these are still a big savings from the store price, and they fit snuggly &amp; the brush part doesn&#x27;t wobble like the generic ones did. I had gotten used to that &amp; when I got these I really appreciated their solidness!</li>
    <li> Not as soft as the soft disposable chew sticks but much softer than all the other Oral-B heads.</li>
    <li> I could no longer find the regular brushes (without the new plastic &#x27;thingys&#x27; they&#x27;re including now).  I had never seen the &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34; brushes before, but I absolutely love them.  In the past a new brush always seemed too harsh, and by the time it was feeling more gentle it was just about time to change it.  These have the perfect amount of stiffness for me, and seem to hold up just as well as the stiffer ones.</li>
    <li> The brush head is too small. It takes too long to brush my teeth because there aren&#x27;t enough bristles. I know that sounds stupid, but it&#x27;s true.</li>
    <li> This is the second unit for me,without any hesitation I bought for second time.Also, the brand of Oral-B is well known ,this design is simple and do the requirement.</li>
    <li> This were exactly what I expected and were cheaper too than what I saw in the stores, a great deal and I am happy with them.</li>
    <li> I love how the timer helps you figure out when to move to the next section of teeth. Also like the warning light if you&#x27;re pressing too hard. Great toothbrush that leaves your teeth clean. Especially good if you have sensitive gums. Nice product and well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it.  My teeth feel so clean after brushing.  And I find the 30 second timer and pressure sensor to be very helpful.  For the first time in my life I love brushing my teeth.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> After too many years of orthodontic correction, I have developed a sensitivity to regular toothbrushes (even those deemed &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;). The standard heads for this electric brush, which include tiny plastic &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34; devices, are a bit too harsh for me. These sensitivity-considerate replaceable brush heads have allowed me to achieve a more desirable level of cleanliness than I could manage with manual brushes. The online price is very good, and the Oral-B electric toothbrush these fit is affordable. I&#x27;m highly pleased with these, and would recommend them to anyone with over-sensitive teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> Good set of brushes for decent price.  Arrived on time and no issues.  Fits the oral B brush as expected.</li>
    <li> Last a long time and am very happy with them. This batch I haven&#x27;t used yet.. I&#x27;ll submit more info later,</li>
    <li> Bough this brushes at a great price and I am very pleased with them! they work excellent and I would recommended further!</li>
    <li> Had  tooth extraction and gum surgery.  While a manual toothbrush is fine to use - appreciate the consistent pressure that a brush head provides.  per my periodontist, my gums have healed extremely well.  I credit the use of these brush heads.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a scrubber on my teeth. The teeth are clean but the gums started to recede. I switched to an Oral B years ago so I could keep my teeth as clean as I liked without scrubbing away all of my gums. My son bought a Sonic to try to keep his orthodontic braces clean and, as it was bought at Costco, came with a second handle. My teeth felt furry after using the Sonic so I gave him the handle for an extra and bought a new Oral B as my old one had no battery life. I still prefer the Oral B. He prefers his Sonic. The extra soft heads are my favourite as they are gentle to my gums. I still use a manual brush for my tongue but can get it almost as clean as with the Oral B. I like that the Oral B signals the end of a cleaning cycle but lets you brush longer to get the tongue or any spots still gritty. The Sonic shuts off at the end of its cycle.</li>
    <li> these were WAY cheaper then the ones at my local store, they work well and are good for my teeth</li>
    <li> These replacements fit my electric toothbrush perfectly; however, I still feel that the bristles are too hard. Why can&#x27;t someone make bristles like the malfunctioning Rotadent? Further, why can&#x27;t a company make a fully oscillating head since these are the only heads that showed any improvement over the toothbrush in a very reliable study?</li>
    <li> I tried the generic brand and they were a waste of money, the longest one lasted 3 weeks, and the shortest one broke in just 4 days.  If you have an Oral-B brush, use the name brand, its worth it.</li>
    <li> The brush is softer than what I had previously</li>
    <li> The OEM are much better/softer than the generic ones.</li>
    <li> Great brushes for a great toothbrush.  Our dental hygienist loves that we use these!</li>
    <li> Good deal  but slow delivery over all happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> Have used the Oral-B before and they are excellent toothbrushes. The previous ones I&#x27;ve used were extremely durable and lasted months passed the recommended replacement date.</li>
    <li> These are the BEST Toothbrush money can buy for sensitive teeth.  I hope that they don&#x27;t stop making them.  The only kind I will ever buy !</li>
    <li> I change the brush every 3 months. Works perfect for my sensitive teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Amazon delivery is Awesome!</li>
    <li> Just started using one of these heads yesterday. Giving it 5 stars to start out - felt good on my teeth and gums, and cleaned my teeth well. Will see how it does during the 3 months it&#x27;s in use. I go to my dentist later this month, so will also be interesting to see if they notice any changes after a month of use.</li>
    <li> A little pricey at round $20.00 for 3! How much does it cost to make them?</li>
    <li> This is my favorite toothbrush head. It is gentle to the gums, but cleans great. My mouth always feels so fresh after I brush with this head,</li>
    <li> I bought these brush heads because I bought the Oral-B vitality electric toothbrush. It came with 2 brush heads. Those brush heads that come with it almost made me want to throw the toothbrush away. The bristles are hard and irritating. The brush would actually bounce off my teeth. It felt like I didn&#x27;t have control of the toothbrush. Then I saw the extra soft brush heads and after reading a few reviews decided to try it. I didn&#x27;t want to buy a new toothbrush, well, it&#x27;s the best investment I ever made. The brush is so soft on my teeth and gums. I can move it all around my mouth easily. My teeth feel really clean. I am so happy with these brushes. I highly recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to make them last longer, don&#x27;t press down or try to scrub your teeth. Let the toothbrush do all the work, just hold on to the handle and move it around your teeth. Pressing down just wears the brushes out faster.</li>
    <li> My teeth are so damn clean you wouldn&#x27;t even believe it. My dental hygienist would practically be out of a job if more people were using these things. Do yourself a favor and buy these so your dentist can compliment you on your exceptional oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> Fiance was having issues with the heads that came with the brush. These brissels are great for sensitivities issues, high recommend.</li>
    <li> This rechargeable provides strong, hard brushing, even with soft btushes.  I would not recommend it for someone who has sensitive gums, or is prone to mouth sores.  I would be nice if it had an indicator of the level of charge.  However, I usually store it on the charger, to overcome that issue.  My teeth feel very clean when I finish using this brush.</li>
    <li> Does not clean as well as the original brush and wears too quickly</li>
    <li> Since I had baby teeth, I&#x27;ve had very sensitive gums. These heads are very well made! No more bleeding!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and the item works as expected.</li>
    <li> have been using this soft version for so long I can not use a different one at all</li>
    <li> These are extra soft heads but I found that in the mornings, the bristles are very hard. I just run them under water for a good 10-15 seconds and they soften up right away. No complaints otherwise.</li>
    <li> I have a very old Oral-B electric toothbrush and it has been a long time since I replaced the brush heads.  This fit on perfectly.  Great price on Amazon and the free shipping with Prime was awesome.</li>
    <li> The heads were exactly what we expected and work great.&lt;br /&gt;They seem over priced but I don&#x27;t regret getting them.</li>
    <li> This tip is very soft, it doesn&#x27;t hurt sensitive gum. The speed it cleans the teeth is super. Highy reccomended.</li>
    <li> The brushes feel soft against the gum, but don&#x27;t get weak in use.  They do the job without hurting the gums.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve decided to just stay with this brand from now on. The bristles are not too soft or too hard. They don&#x27;t fall apart after a week or so. They fit snugly as intended. I&#x27;ve tried other brands but they feel cheap, fall apart or just don&#x27;t measure up to the same quality as these.</li>
    <li> It is hard to find the 3-pack of Soft brush heads in my town, so it&#x27;s easier to buy them on Amazon.com</li>
    <li> I order 2 sets, get 1 set. Look like I will order 1 set at a time in the future to get what I ordered!&lt;br /&gt;One week later, when you order from some one that sell for Amazon, your review is working very fast! When you order from Amazon and Amazon makes a mistake, it take forever to get your answer. Is this abusing power? Is this Amazon over power other? Is this Amazon too big now and does not give a dam about their customer? I think we all must take an action here, go back to buy at department store near you to stop this s*** from Amazon????!!!</li>
    <li> Brush heads provide a dentist clean feeling every time.  They transmit a bit of vibration from the handle though. Too soon to rate wear times.</li>
    <li> Toothbrush heads are what I needed and love the gentleness to my gums.  Would buy for my Oral-B again. Great product.</li>
    <li> They work as you would expect and are durable.Everything I have bought from Oral B is of good quality and price.</li>
    <li> Brushing my teeth is so much easier with Oral-B, and the sensitive brush heads are perfect for someone like me who has been warned by dentists not to brush too hard lest I cause damage to my already-slightly-receded gums. A periodontist once told me, &amp;#34;Every human on the planet should be using a toothbrush with extra-soft bristles. Brushes marked &#x27;firm&#x27; belong in hardware stores, not in people&#x27;s mouths.&amp;#34; Of course I wish these replacement heads were less expensive. Oral-B seems to be following the template that computer printer manufacturers have developed: make the price of the main unit (in this case, the charger and brush handle; in HP&#x27;s case, the inkjet or laser printer) artificially low and then recover your costs by jacking up the price of the refills (the brush heads and the ink cartridges). Still, I&#x27;m happier with my Oral-B unit than I was with Sonicare, which wasn&#x27;t engineered as well (the toothpaste would inevitably run down the handle of the brush and get all over my hand, which doesn&#x27;t happen with the Oral-B).</li>
    <li> happy with this item and the time it took to receive it.  harder to find this item.  glad to have found it.</li>
    <li> Feels like a dentist cleaned my teeth. My wife loves it to.</li>
    <li> They last ages and the electric toothbrush these refills belong to, last for years, and are still going!! How much can you say about refills? Lol!</li>
    <li> The brush heads are designed to work with my toothbrush and work great.  The price is right for my budget.</li>
    <li> My husband likes these very much. They clean well, but are gentle on sensitive gums. He uses his brush everyday.</li>
    <li> Love it. Use it on my Braun sonic toothbrush.  The brushes are comfortable and last typically around 3 months, which is about as long as you can expect toothbrushes to last.</li>
    <li> I had bought these before.  They are gentle on the gums.  They work as expected. They are reliable. I trust the brand.</li>
    <li> I rated this product with 5 stars for the high quality of the product.  Easy to use, for the outsanting performance to keep my mouth clean and in excellent conditions.  I recommend this product to everybody.  Is completely excellent.</li>
    <li> Only place I could find toothbrush to fit for sensitive teeth, thankful I could order them. They are what dentist recommend.</li>
    <li> They fit and they work.  M</li>
    <li> The bristles are soft on teeth and gums and for people who have tender gums that is a must have!</li>
    <li> They fit my Braun electric toothbrush perfectly and work fine.</li>
    <li> these brush heads are just what the doctor ordered,&lt;br /&gt;my dentist always said to use a soft brush, so these are perfect.</li>
    <li> Oral-B appears to be slipping. Brushes are a little hard from what they used to be causing me to question &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; in the description.</li>
    <li> I bought three extra packages of these brushes to go with the Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean &amp; Floss Action Precision 5000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush.  My gums do not bleed any more from brushing my teeth.  My teeth never got this clean when I was using my regular toothbrush.  I definately would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love these Sensitive tooth brush tips, I have been using them for years, the dental hygienist is always surprised how clean my teeth are.</li>
    <li> Nice brush heads.  Comfortable and clean very well even though they are extra-soft.  Bought due to some minor dental issues, and these heads are working well.</li>
    <li> They were fine ... with freight &amp; taxes they were the same price as I could have bought locally, which i will do the next time</li>
    <li> If I buy something--lipstick, sunglasses, favorite drink, energy bar--whatever, it&#x27;s sure to go out of stock.  I seem to be on the end of the curve.  I have sensitive teeth (as do many of us of a certain age), and I find I&#x27;m not as thorough in brushing as I need to be.  I bought the tooth brush years ago for a very reasonable price (like $20).  But the brushes? Not so reasonable.  Then I couldn&#x27;t get them at all.  Turn to good old Amazon and there you are! These are just what I needed, and I&#x27;ll be ordering them again, assuming I don&#x27;t wear out the brush base itself.</li>
    <li> I tend to be a hard tooth brusher.  I find these brush heads to give me a good brushing without any damage to my teeth.  Works great with Oral-B 4000 which lets you know when you are brushing too hard. I will definitely buy more.  Also good for people with sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> As described. Arrived timely.</li>
    <li> Fits the Oral B toothbrush as advertised.</li>
    <li> These work great, feel great... very happy!</li>
    <li> The Oral-B Sensitive brush heads are sometimes hard to find in the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; version.  For packs of five or less, Amazon prices cannot be beat.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Oral-B for years.  Unfortunately, the same could be said of the brush heads.  I could never remember when to replace them so I usually didn&#x27;t.  The solution I stumbled upon was to change the brush heads whenever I change the filters in my PUR water pitcher.  Apparently, it does make a difference--or at least that&#x27;s what my dental hygienist said.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth. This brush head cleans great and doesn&#x27;t irritate my gums or teeth. I&#x27;ve seen a drop in the number of canker sores I get since using this brush head.</li>
    <li> My teeth are really happy now.</li>
    <li> original replacements, price was good</li>
    <li> Worked for me, decent price.  (The non-Oral-B brand ones that I bought cheaper did not work well - kept coming off while brushing)</li>
    <li> They are too soft for me... They are Oral-B look a likes made in China</li>
    <li> I purchased these when they were on sale. Can&#x27;t beat an electric toothbrush. Great product at a great price! I&#x27;d definitely keep an eye out for cheap prices though as these can get expensive.</li>
    <li> You too might be worried that the soft bristles might not brush enough, but they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the Sensitive because I grind my teeth as as a consequence my gums recess. I also realize now that I previously was brushing too hard. You&#x27;ll see that too if you look at the wear on your bristles, making them curvy after only 2-3 mos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past I would shop for OralB-like tooth heads, often ordering non Oral-B brands. In retrospect by saving a few dollars per toothhead I was damaging my gums permanently - something worth more than $5. Don&#x27;t be penny wise and gums foolish, get the Oral-B Sensitive.</li>
    <li> Great for everyday use. Charge lasts for a week. Makes a slight humming noise - might be annoying, if you&#x27;re new to electric toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Selected this one based on other reviews and was surprised by how good it was.</li>
    <li> These are much more comfortable than the ones that came with my toothbrush. They are comfortable on my sensitive teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> These are outrageously priced in stores, and very cheap on Amazon, though the price keeps changing. I believe it is unwise to use the Oral B toothbrush with its normal heads, because teeth are delicate if you want them to last into your 90s or beyond. These heads are hopefully soft enough to accomplish that. At least in my case, many years of use of these heads has not resulted in any noticeable damage compared to what the old handheld toothbrushes did to me.</li>
    <li> Sensitive for her&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Floss Action for me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product</li>
    <li> Now the dentist tells me I&#x27;ve been brushing too hard for decades. Damage is done. These gentle brush heads get my teeth clean without aggravating the sensitive area at the gumline. Won&#x27;t use anything else. These are the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an RDA so my teeth are very important and my Oral B electric brush is a must. These extra soft brush heads are perfect and they are hard to find in the store; so ordering a years worth at time is wonderful</li>
    <li> There was no packing list.</li>
    <li> Much softer than the regular brush heads.</li>
    <li> Exactly what they say they are.  I used one as soon as I received it and felt the difference in comparison to the knock offs.  I just hope they last the 3 months as advertised.</li>
    <li> Beats the medium firmness heads that come with the original purchase of the Braun.  Much easier on my teeth, no enamel abrasions, still keeps them super white, removing or preventing coffee, tea and red wine stains,</li>
    <li> Like these as unlike the other heads they are super gentle on your teeth.</li>
    <li> We have used Oral B electric toothbrush for decades.  I switched from the regular brush head to the sensitive head to protect from over brushing at the gum line.  It does a good job with cleaning and soft on the gum.</li>
    <li> Once you&#x27;ve bought into the Oral B vibrating toothbrush technology you have to replace the brush head every 3 months (according to my dentist who may or may not own stock in Oral B). I chose the gentle brush which works fine for me.</li>
    <li> This came in a non-retail packaging (makes me think it&#x27;s refurbished) and when attempting to submit for rebate as offered, I received a notification back from Oral-B stating that the UPC code sent in with the rebate form was invalid, despite the fact that it came directly off of the packaging that was sent.  The toothbrush is fine and I&#x27;ve used them for years, but Id highly recommend buying elsewhere as clearly they dont care much about Amazon customers.</li>
    <li> These extra soft brush heads can be hard to find at stores and usually out at the dentist office.  They are excellent for recession or sensitive teeth.  They clean throughly without abraison.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product and it&#x27;s appropriately soft.  I do use it for a while, probably longer than directed.  Replenishing the brushes is as expensive as buying the brush/charger--obviously this is where the money is made.  If you like the brush, you&#x27;re pretty much a captive audience especially as the generic brushes have terrible reviews.</li>
    <li> I should have paid more attention to the user ratings and spent more money on a better toothbrush. This was my mistake not Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> I always try to buy my Oral-B sensitive brush heads from Amazon. com because they are cheaper than in the local stores.  I have sensitive teeth and cannot use any other kind.  What a difference this automatic toothbrush has made on my special needs son&#x27;s teeth.  I could never do a good job of cleaning his teeth with a regular tooth brush.  His gums were receding and he had horrible white patches on his teeth.  The dentist sent him to a periodontist and after several visits, she recommended Oral-B automatic toothbrush so I bought one.  His teeth look entirely different.  They no longer have white patches and really look nice.  His gums are in such good shape now that his new hygientist cannot believe he ever was sent to a periodontist.</li>
    <li> I would have given a 5/5 if the sensitive electric brush heads were much closer in price to tandard bristle electric brush heads, and if I had had the oppertunity to have used one for at least 3 months from the time of this review to find out the lifespan of this variety of replacement head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having sensitive teeth limits my oral hygine product choices, so having the option of an electric brush head is good but it would be much better if more stores carried soft bristled brushes&lt;br /&gt;(electric or otherwise) and</li>
    <li> Work well for a good cleaning with the Oral-B Professional Deep Clean Brush.  They interchange for the type clean wanted.  It is good to change them frequently.  It leaves a very clean feeling.</li>
    <li> well worth getting these if you have sesitive teeth or gums.</li>
    <li> these brushes are hard to get now, amazon has always had them available on line. these are the second brush heads I have purchased from you</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended I use these brushes because of my sensitive gums. I have been using them for a while and like them.</li>
    <li> if you purchase the electric toothbrush you dont have a choice but to buy the heads none come with the product curious to see how long they last so far so good</li>
    <li> I bought these for my husband for Christmas!  He needed them as replacements for his Braun electric toothbrush.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> fast ship&lt;br /&gt;glad they made this extra soft for kids and especially for gum receding people&lt;br /&gt;expensive but the motor is a good price</li>
    <li> I czan only say that I purchased these replacements for after 3-4 months of daily use I will replace the heads. If they are as good as the origional I have no problem</li>
    <li> It is very soft, feels great! I would highly recommend it after comparing with other Oral B brush heads models.</li>
    <li> Product as expected, happy with it all.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing much to add for simple brush heads, correct brand and all fine.</li>
    <li> I was happy to be able to get these brush heads, I haven&#x27;t been able to find them lately.  And the price was better than I&#x27;ve ever paid in 15 years.</li>
    <li> What can you say about toothbrush heads? Oral-B Sensitive, extra-soft is what my dentist recommends. The name-brand ones are relatively long-lasting, but pricey; however, I&#x27;ve purchased non-name brand ones (from Target), which I did not like--not soft enough.</li>
    <li> price was  about $6 more than Rite Aid  generic brand for same quantity  6 brushes. Rite Aid brushes were a struggle to to put on and take off  power head. $27 I paid for 6 was  only 4 dollars more than for 3 Oral B brushes at drug  store.</li>
    <li> Like these...Oral-B Sensitive (3 Extra-Soft Brush heads)...we go through them so quick very pricey. But a necessity for us have considered going back to manual ones.</li>
    <li> We like the product.  It brushes teeth well and does not hurt gums at the same time.</li>
    <li> The Oral-B sensitive extra soft brush heads are gentle on sensitive teeth and gums and are worth getting. I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Good price for hard to find item delivered to your home.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re essential, not available in my area!</li>
    <li> Needed soft ones - found them here as NA at stores.  They do the job.</li>
    <li> Best of the Oral B toothbrushes and that&#x27;s from a former Dental Hygienist. I would recommend this above any of the other brushes they offer.</li>
    <li> I bought these to replace the brush head that came with the electric toothbrush originally.  They are noticeably softer and still do the job well.  Will purchase these again when the time comes.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush for my needs over many of the other Oral-B products available.  It cleans well and is gentle on the gums.</li>
    <li> All dentists recommend now adays to go with a soft brush head whenever possible, as there is no noticable increase in plaque removal going with a rougher brush.  Instead, you run the risk of gum recession; especially if you are brushing too hard and improperly.  These brush heads are great and a really excellent price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Oral-B Sensitive (3 Extra-Soft Brush heads) great product and great deal. Fast shipping. Highly recommended for sensitive teeth, gets all teeth clean, would buy again. Cheers</li>
    <li> Does a great job of cleaning one&#x27;s teeth, and massaging one&#x27;s gums.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know the reasons but I can&#x27;t buy these in South Korea......so I ordered these .....and I really love these.....fine to clean my gum and teeth.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using the product for a month now and it still works well; shipping was also quick.</li>
    <li> Own both a sonicare essence and the oral B. Overall cheaper than the sonicare and the rotating heads give me at least the illusion that it cleans better, however, cleaning the head is an issue as the hole in the front below the head is a bacteria trap. The sonicare has the same issue under the toothbrush heads. This would be an oustanding product if the hole wasn&#x27;t there.</li>
    <li> All my local stores quit carrying the extra soft toothbrush heads which are great for sensitive teeth. I have been using these for years. They are very gentle on your teeth&#x27;s enamel but not sacrificing getting them squeaky clean!</li>
    <li> I have used the wrong attachment &amp;#34;for me&amp;#34; with my Oral B for over 2 years!  I never realized a sensitive brush head existed until recently.  What a difference!  Love it, and it was a great buy on Amazon!</li>
    <li> The heads which came with the new Oral B electric are like concrete, so we doubly appreciated these great soft heads.  Perfecto.</li>
    <li> It works really well.  Great product, shipped quick, definitely good for sensitive teeth.  Very happy with purchase &amp; I will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth and these don&#x27;t bother me one bit!  Great product!  Truly gives you that &amp;#34;just back from the dentist feel.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This was one of my first experiences with a product like this and I was nervous about whether or not this would be too harsh for me to use.  Wonderful!</li>
    <li> I bought them specifically for my young daughter. She like to brush her teeth with this type of heads because its soft and doesn&#x27;t irritate gums that much</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product at a wonderful price.  My husband is disabled and I brush his teeth for him, and these are nice and soft and have lasted very, very well.  I would recommend this totally.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this brush head and I am very happy with it.  They don&#x27;t last really long, but I have sensitive teeth and it&#x27;s the best way to brush.</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t much exciting to say about these replacement toothbrush heads.  They work well, just like the original ones, and my teeth are cleaner after using it!</li>
    <li> This is softer than many of the other oral-b toothbrush head refills. I often press too hard when brushing and end up with receding gums because of that, and these softer heads make it difficult for me to press too hard. These are good for people with sensitive teeth too.</li>
    <li> I like brushing with Oral-B&#x27;s sensitive, extra soft brush heads.  The regular ones are much too harsh to use so I use these even though I do not have sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> The replacement brushes fit my Brush/irrigator machine allowing me to have replacements handy when the brush indicator reveals that replacement is due.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushhead is soft and excellent for the Gum areas as well as the teeth. A good price for the sake of your oral health.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great to have an inexpensive source for the replacement brushes in what I think is the best electronic toothbrush on the market. I will reorder again from this source.</li>
    <li> I had several gum areas that were sensitive to the previous Oral-B brush heads I was using, and those areas were marked by my dental hygienist as receding. Within 2-3 weeks of switching to these extra-soft brush heads, the gingival sensitivity has disappeared.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about the choice of toothbrush heads I bought, since there seem to be quite a few reviews about un-authorized or generic/knockoff brush heads being sold, especially a few years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after viewing a few options seriously -- including the more normal-hardness bristles, I went with these. I don&#x27;t have sensitive gums or anything, these just seemed like they had the best reviews/satisfaction for a good price. I&#x27;ve been using the first brush head for a few weeks now and I&#x27;m happy with it. Can&#x27;t say I can even notice a difference from the original head in my Precision Clean...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d encourage sorting reviews by date to let you know if there&#x27;s been recent bad batches of this kind of item sent out recently...</li>
    <li> I need softer toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;This is better than the normal ones.&lt;br /&gt;It does not have any of those hard, thick bristles that some of the other ones do.</li>
    <li> This generation of e toothbrush is significantly better than the last Oral B.  It&#x27;s as simple as that.  Sold and recommended by my very finicky dentist.</li>
    <li> I tried to find these brush heads locally and couldn&#x27;t find them.  So, I searched online, found this site, and ordered.  The brushes came on time, in good shape and are working out extremely well.  They fit my Braun powered toothbrush--Braun and Oral-B are owned by the same company.  I&#x27;ll be ordering another packet as soon as I change the current brush head.</li>
    <li> We love this sensitive head for the Oral-B brush.  My son has braces and these work the best and are also easy on his gums while getting into hard to reach areas.  Definitely will get some more as needed.</li>
    <li> Dont get fooled by the cheap offers on groupon.  They wont be authentic oral b heads like these!  Switched to the sensitive heads after my dentist said the flossing heads are too aggressive on my gums.  These work great and feel amazing on your gums while still cleaning perfectly.  go for it!</li>
    <li> The product does exactly what it is suppose to do.  It cleans your teeth, is very gentle on the gums</li>
    <li> I like the way this tooth brush cleans, I just wish I could get more toothpaste on it.  Since the cleaning surfaced is circular and small the toothpaste is spread only on the first group of teeth it touches.  If I could figure a way around that problem I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I have used four of the 12 in the first 9 months (I change them every 90 days). One of the four would not rotate. These aren&#x27;t original equipment and they sometimes slip gears or don&#x27;t work as expected but for the price I just throw the ones that don&#x27;t work away and move on to the next in the package.</li>
    <li> I have gum recession from using a regular toothbrush.  I was told by a hygenist to brush my gums, it would keep them healthy.  BAD idea.  It caused them to recede and I wish I had never listened to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, using these heads has prevented that from happening anymore. They are soft and by using an electric toothbrush I can hold the brush head against the tooth itself, avoiding the gum line, let the vibrating bristles get my teeth sparkling clean and keep my gums healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great find.</li>
    <li> The soft brush heads are gentler on your gums and enamel.  Love them.</li>
    <li> Does a good job.  Great value</li>
    <li> Quck shipment and perfect product.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my sensitive teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> my favorite toothbrush head for my favorite electric toothbrush going on 6 years!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this item; had hard time finding the sensitive ones in my local stores.</li>
    <li> Our young kids use our old Oral-B toothbrushes, and these heads work extremely well for them.  THe bristles are soft enough that they don&#x27;t cause any discomfort, but these heads still do an outstanding job of cleaning their teeth.</li>
    <li> Using for receding gums.</li>
    <li> I have been buying these for several years and just love them.  My dentist says my teeth look great too and I do not have a lot of placque build up.  I have sensitive teeth too and these work great.</li>
    <li> all okay and using this item</li>
    <li> Good replacements for the originals which came with the Oral-B pro 1000 brush and oxy-jet system.</li>
    <li> Much prefer these to the standard brushes.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and needed. Fits my Oral-B Vitality, has nice soft bristles, runs smooth and does an excellent job of cleaning. Package arrived quickly and was well packaged.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. Just what I wanted and needed!</li>
    <li> what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Much softer on the gums.  My dentist recommends the sensitive.</li>
    <li> Soft brisles on the brush and easy to use. I use it twice a day am satisfied with its use.</li>
    <li> These dont tear my gums and my dentist recommeded the electric brush. My gums are in great shape now. I am an intermittent flosser.&lt;br /&gt;Does a better job of brushing them I do.</li>
    <li> The product came very fast and was a much better price than at any store in my area.  The sensitive heads are so much gentler on my gums!</li>
    <li> Great heads - the regular ones cause my gums to be sore.&lt;br /&gt;Have a 3 pack on auto-ship so I don&#x27;t run out!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased to purchase this product at a good price.</li>
    <li> I bought this item and in the end I felt it was not up to my liking.  It was in my price range at the time.  I recommend saving up and buying the upgraded set up which lasts longer and is a better functioning product.  This is okay in a travel pinch.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described with quick delivery.</li>
    <li> have used these brush heads for years and will continue as long as I brush my teeth. They do the job and don&#x27;t irritate your gums like regular brushes can do.</li>
    <li> Works as it/they should. It&#x27;s nice to be able purchase these from Amazon and not pay a ridiculous price! Thank you!</li>
    <li> used Oral B for years.  Easier to use effectively than a manual brush</li>
    <li> My gums are very sensitive so I can&#x27;t use the regular brushes. These work so well and they do not irritate my gums.</li>
    <li> returning customer.  Love there toothbrush heads.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than the stores, it&#x27;s an original Oral-B so it works great.</li>
    <li> I purchased another one of these electric toothbrushes, since my other one wore out.  It is easy to use, does a great job, easy to change out the brush heads (although they have become expensive as of late), and keeps a good charge.  I love using this Oral-B toothbrush with the sensitive brush heads as my gums can be sensitive to a regular toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Compatible to my Oral-B electronic toothbrush. Softer bristles than my Floss Action brushes.</li>
    <li> I have receding gum lines and I am supposed to use soft heads. These are soft. I replace them every 3 months just like a manual toothbrush and this is an excellent price.</li>
    <li> as expected, good price.</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly (as described) onto the electric toothbrush.  Used the heads for my sensitive teeth and gums and for my child&#x27;s toddler teeth.</li>
    <li> I ran out of my replaceable brushes for my Oral B brush so I ordered Oral B sensitive (3 pack) more.  thank you</li>
    <li> My wife has sensitive teeth. This is the only brush head that she is comfortable with. I have this item on subscription.</li>
    <li> Works great! Softer bristles still allow for a good clean while being more gentle on your gums. I was having troubles in some spots with sensitivity of my gums while brushing, and this toothbrush head reduced sensitivity while still removing all the plaque! This is a great addition to the Oral-B electric toothbrush line!</li>
    <li> The brushhead is very soft, good for sensitive gum. These are original from oral B so you can expect them to last longer than third party brands.</li>
    <li> With this, now i have all the brush heads for my oral B professional electric toothbrush. And i must confess they all do the works</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> These are so much better than what came with my Oral B electric/rechargeable toothbrush. These brush heads are soft and gently on my gums. I am exceptionally happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The three pack is handy to have in the lavatory draw when a new brush is needed.</li>
    <li> These brush heads are noticeably soft but still do a great job. They are not that easy to find in a store.</li>
    <li> Product is as advertised and was received sooner than promised. Makes my teeth and gums feel cleaner than manual brush. Brushes feel good on my Sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> IPad originally purchased my Oral-B 1000 on Amazon and love it.  After a while, I needed to replace the rotati gbrush head, so I ordered these.  I thought they were supposed to be the same as what was originally on my brush, but they weren&#x27;t.  However, they fit the appliance and do the job that I need.</li>
    <li> My electric toothbrush must be 15 years old-- The original oral-b.  My head must of been 4 years old - lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy what a difference.  It says extra soft brush heads- which they are in feel.. But when you get to brushing they feel very firm and sturdy.  Makes brushing teeth meaningful again.  I ordered the 3-pack and will be set for many years- lol..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No bristles fall off like I have seen in other reviews- part fits right on and works like original OEM replacement.  Glad I get reward points from work to I can buy these &amp;#34;little&amp;#34; things I never buy at the store.</li>
    <li> If your dentist wants you to have a soft toothbrush this can be it.  This still cleans your teeth, but in a gentle way without leaving  brush scratches on your teeth, yes that happens people when you brush too hard.</li>
    <li> After a few weeks use, the bristles are starting to spread. I really like how soft the heads are, which will help me in reducing my gum recession. It is a little costly for such fragile brush heads.</li>
    <li> I bought this along with Oral B pro health electric brush ( it runs on 2 AA batteries).The result is my teeth comes out so clean that I will not go back to manual toothbrush again. I recommend everyone who wants to take better care of their teeth to try it.</li>
    <li> I have used Oral-B toothbrush replacements for years.  I am trying to save my bottom teeth.  I change more often than they recommend.</li>
    <li> They are great, soft is easy on my mouth and makes for a great aid to the oral b electric brush. I definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using them for over 6 years, and just love them...</li>
    <li> These are for my orthodontic wearing kid and another who just finished.  I thought softer bristles would be better for them.</li>
    <li> Oral B brush heads are getting hard to find in my area, so I was glad to find them on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Good for tender gums!</li>
    <li> Good but expensive. But why is it 3-count per package? Why not four or two?</li>
    <li> Product is as described.  I love it, and I will condiser buying more of these as needed.  Way to go!</li>
    <li> I love this Oral-B.  It&#x27;s so easy to use and has lasted  a long time.  If you don&#x27;t know how long you have brushed this toothbrush will tell you.</li>
    <li> Glad to have brushes for my Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush. The Oral-B brand name brush heads ARE more expensive than the store/generic brand. Good product.</li>
    <li> This makes brushing your teeth a pleasure.  Now you can get at those hard to reach places at the back with ease.</li>
    <li> I like this softer brush much better than the harder bristle brushes although I switch off with the floss brush head a couple of times a week.  I had stopped using the electric tooth brush and after a couple of years, although I was diligent with the manual brush, I noticed that my gums seemed to be receding a little.  My dentist confirmed that although I was getting my teeth and gums clean, also due to good flossing, my gums were doing better with the electric toothbrush so I retreived my unit from the cabinet and have been happy using the Oral B again.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush is recommended by my dentist and he knows best.  The brush heads really hold up to the number of brushings I put them through.  They are specifically made for my electronic toothbrush and even though their are generic brands out there, I will continue to use oral-b.  I am using the subscription mode and feel that it works best for my budget.</li>
    <li> I had tried some of the store-brand brushes  and was always dissapointed. These Oral-B brushes cost more but do a better job.  I can recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy cheap ones from other manufacturers. These genuine Oral-B brush is not that expensive ($3-4/each), but more quiet and stable. I replace them every 1-1.5 months.</li>
    <li> Good quality and, thankfully, only have to order one style replacement part of the attachment set for Waterpik. Will order again when needed.</li>
    <li> Name brand Oral-B brush heads at a pretty good price. There is nothing really special about this purchase to comment on.</li>
    <li> Buy it. The tooth brushes work just fine for us. We will purchase this item again and will tell our friends and family to do as well.</li>
    <li> These are excellent replacement heads for my Braun auto tooth brush.Took me a while to find the right replacements heads &amp; these are great. They are soft, fit perfect in brush, &amp; do an excellent job in teeth cleaning. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a replacement for the same item bought in stores, so we must like it.</li>
    <li> Recommended by dentist. I guess it works better. It&#x27;s not particularly easy to stop drooling and spilling toothpaste all over the place in use. Maybe if you have a big mouth.</li>
    <li> Always by the Oral-B brand.  I tried the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; generic brand and the brussels were way too stiff.</li>
    <li> They are as expected, classic brush heads replacements, I like the fact that they are soft.&lt;br /&gt;I love my Oral-B electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> It fits &amp; works as advertised but the head is 1/2 the size of the head that came with my Oral-B electric toothbrush</li>
    <li> My wife can&#x27;t use the regular brushes as her teeth are very sensitive. These are perfect and do not irritate her gums at all. I would give them five stars, but they seem to wear faster than the regular bristle brush that I use. Deduct one star for that.</li>
    <li> These sensitive brushes are hard to find in stores, but apparently are better for one&#x27;s teeth and gums than the others.  Will definitely keep buying them.</li>
    <li> The Oral-B electric toothbrush is my preferred toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for people (like me) who have sensitive gums and/or teeth. Cleans very well without making my gums bleed and doesn&#x27;t set off my tooth sensitivity for heat or cold.</li>
    <li> Nice brushes, fit Oral B unit very well.  Clean teeth and gums well, don&#x27;t hurt gums.</li>
    <li> Fantastic if you have more sensitive gums or even just don&#x27;t want to feel like you&#x27;re brushing with a tough brush head.  I bought these to replace the stock ones that come with the Oral B Precision.  Much more enjoyable to brush with.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that any Oral B replacement head will fit any Oral B electric toothbrush!  Thank you, Oral B!  These brush heads are large enough to cover every tooth, yet soft enough that they don&#x27;t damage your enamel.  The bristles also get between your teeth very well.  These brush heads do a wonderful job of cleaning my teeth!  Yes, I recommend them!</li>
    <li> why are these so costly, and no one is really any less</li>
    <li> I love these brush heads. They are gentle on the gums but do a great job cleaning even in the tightest places. In combination with Go-Betweens or ribbon floss they make their users the dental hygienist&#x27;s favorite.</li>
    <li> Like these, they are easier on the gums and I can apply a little more pressure, I feel like with the extra pressure I get cleaner teeth without hurting my gums.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, no bells and whistles. Just plain old brush head doing its job. No complaints so far and I will be reordering.</li>
    <li> .........but the bristles still seem just a bit too firm.  I was expecting a much softer bristle but they seem to do the job.</li>
    <li> The best Power toothbrush replacement heads available!  Do not settle for an off (knock-off) brand or P/L brand!</li>
    <li> We love these sensitive toothbrush heads and find it hard to purchase anywhere else.  Amazon always comes through for us.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with the softness of the toothbrush heads. I will be purchasing more as will be needed in the future.</li>
    <li> I love these - they are gentle and not to soft- have extra ones on hand if you brush 3 times a day. They should be changed once a month,</li>
    <li> this brush is noticeably softer than the standard brush to the touch. my dentist tells me soft or extra soft are the only two options for brushes. i guess the others are hard on teeth and gums, especially on electric brushes. anyway, a few points to note.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;first this one has bristles that are flush across the top. the standard version have some raised bristles on the outer edge of the brush head. i wish these did have those extended bristles because it feels like these do not get into the gaps as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also worth noting that they don&#x27;t feel much different once on the handle and rotating. they move so fast it seems like they are almost as harsh and standard brushes. i&#x27;ll stick with these for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July 17th update&lt;br /&gt;so i can tell they are softer when in use too. i like these.</li>
    <li> Glad I bought these! Very soft and gently on your teeth and gums so I don&#x27;t have to worry about my gum&#x27;s receding.</li>
    <li> Only place I can fine the EXTRA soft brush head at a reasonable price. Items delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Great product, and quick delivery!</li>
    <li> Great way of brushing without hurting teeth.</li>
    <li> Very soft bristles. Much easier on my gums than the regular kind. Buy these if you think the others are too rough.</li>
    <li> too soft for mei like the othrs i got bettertheuy are usable thoughjust too soft for meby a tad ok not great</li>
    <li> This is a nice toothbrush, but wish it had a choice of speed controls.  I purchased softer brush heads to help, but still would prefer a slower rotation speed.</li>
    <li> I bit too soft! But we still used them!</li>
    <li> As advertised, fits perfectly on my Oral B electric toothbrush. This is the brand that my dentist originally recommended, and I have been using it for years and years.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product several times from Amazon, and I have to say, these tooth brushes are as described.  They seem to last quite awhile.  Shipment was very fast from Amazon.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is working very well. It not only provides new brushes but is a great reminder to change in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know I had sensitive gums, but the regular brush heads were awfully hard on my gums.  I tried these, and I have to say it is a vast improvement.  I feel that they get my teeth just as clean as the regular ones.  I recommend trying these if you&#x27;re experiencing discomfort with the other models.</li>
    <li> the brush is very soft, I like it very much.  It has very good quality never use it before. It is your good choice.</li>
    <li> This is the second set I have ordered of these brushes, and I don&#x27;t think I need to say any more.</li>
    <li> The shipping was prompt, the product was well packaged and exactly what I expected.  I would order again when I need more Oral-B heads for my electric toothbrush.  I just wanted extras to keep on hand and have not yet utilized the softer brushes but feel that is what I will need on my next replacement.</li>
    <li> These are PERFECT!!! They fit snugly and everything works on it!</li>
    <li> price here is a lot cheaper than anywhere I know..Have 2 electric tooth brushes and change heads every couple of months..</li>
    <li> These Oral B-Sensitive brush heads are perfect for me. I have sensitive teeth and these brushes are just what the dentist ordered. They have the indicator bristles which signal when it is time to replace the brush head. I like that because my dentist recommends changing your brush every 3 months and in about three months the indicator bristles have changed from blue to white. These are great and the price is cheaper than the grocery store.</li>
    <li> I like these brush heads better than some of the other styles for the Oral-B, and, really, they all clean about the same.  Just watch for the sales, because prices can vary tremendously for the same item.</li>
    <li> Oral-B is my favorite electric toothbrush and the sensitive heads make it easier to tolerate for someone who has more sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> We wanted to try electric toothbrushes again so we were given the Oral-B as Christmas gifts. The original brush heads that come on the toothbrush was so rough on our gums. I was about to through the whole thing away. I decided to look for softer ones and I found these. Has made a huge difference.</li>
    <li> I have a very hard time finding the &amp;#34;SENSITIVE&amp;#34; grade of replacement brush and I live in a large metro area.  For me my hygenist has had only good things to say about my gums for the last 4 visits, you can do the math to derive the TYPICAL time period that would be covered by 4 visits.  Her tip for me was to gently MASSAGE  my gums after brushing, she indicated to me that I should only do this with a SOFT bristle, FOR ME this has worked out well, you milage may vary</li>
    <li> My dentist insists I now brush with \\&quot;soft\\&quot; bristles.  I didn&#x27;t realize Oral B had choices in bristle softness/hardness. I always bought at the grocery store and never found the \\&quot;soft\\&quot; bristle option - so had no choice but to order from Amazon. Love these soft bristles. The regular bristles were like brushing my teeth with rocks.  These are like feathers.  The only similar experience was the Rotadent which was way expensive and also difficult to find replacement heads. Since I lost the charger to the Rotadent and didn&#x27;t want the hassle of ordering a replacement - just used the Oral B.  This I can afford and my dentist will be happy I&#x27;m now using the soft bristles.</li>
    <li> There isnt too much you can write about when reviewing a toothbrush head; however, i would most definitely recommend this product for those who have sensitive teeth and want something that is strong enough to clean but gentle enough for the sensitive teeth/gums.</li>
    <li> these smaller heads work great for small mouths (3 year old and six year old son&#x27;s, so far no cavities)</li>
    <li> I have a receding gum line and therefore am very careful about what kind of toothbrush and toothbrush head I used. These toothbrush heads are the best that I have experienced. My mouth still gets very clean and yet it is very gentle on my gums. I&#x27;ve been using these toothbrush heads for a month now and don&#x27;t think I will ever use any other type!</li>
    <li> My husband need a soft toothbrush and was glad to find it here.</li>
    <li> As billed.  However, took longer than expected to arrive.</li>
    <li> perfect, impossible to find locally. No more gum irritation from bristles that are too hard for me.</li>
    <li> Its Great for people who have sensitive teeth best used with sensitive toothpaste</li>
    <li> The price will blow you out of the water!</li>
    <li> These are good, they work well. I do not know if they will last as long as the original ones that came with the Oral B toothbrush. I am glad that they don&#x27;t need a breaking in time. The other kind you have to really pay attention not to press down too hard so you don&#x27;t rip up your gums.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive gums.  These work really well to clean my teeth without irritating my gums.</li>
    <li> Touchy touchy. Never a sore gum or worn out enamel.  Comfortable. Highly recommend for thin enamel and weak gums.</li>
    <li> All was OK, except that I don&#x27;t need to use one of them yet, so I don&#x27;t know for sure that it&#x27;s an all-out 5!</li>
    <li> Does its job and is really gentle on teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy and really brushes well. I like that the brush lets you know when to change sides of the mouth every 30 seconds.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and the the texture is perfect</li>
    <li> They are great. Cheaper than the store by far.</li>
    <li> glad that Oral B makes soft tips because dentist said that normal head was being too hard on my gums and leading to sensitivity. Soft head has solved that problem and it works great. thanks Oral B :)</li>
    <li> Tried the national chain store brand. Bought these.  Definitely softer and gentler on gum tissue.  Do NOT press down on your gums.  lightly hold agains teeth and be careful along gum line.  Protect your investment!!</li>
    <li> These soft brushes are great. I like it more than the other regular one. Just try it, you won&#x27;t regret.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this product for years and I love it. My teeth love this product and it is gentle on my gums.</li>
    <li> I have been using the generic brushes marked &amp;#34;Soft&amp;#34;as my main Braun electric toothbrush and these are far superior and worth the extra cost if you need an extra soft brush for sensitive teeth or gums.  The bristles are soft and pliable yet seem to clean well.  I experience much less bleeding (almost none after a few days) using these brushes compared with the generic types marked soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each brush is individually wrapped in a blister-pack.  When you open up the outer package you will find 3 individually wrapped brushes. This allows you to keep the ones that don&#x27;t need to be used safe and sanitary in a drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaints are all this packaging requires a scissors to open-- both the outer package and the individual blister packs.  And for $19.88 plus shipping I would have expected to receive 4 brushes, to fit the 4 slots in my toothbrush holder in the Braun Oral B.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased and glad I bought it at a good price. It is helping me with my oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> These are the heads I have used for years.  LOVE this size.</li>
    <li> I need to use soft brush heads for my Oral B power toothbrush.  These work perfectly for me and I will continue to use them.  My gums are happy, my mouth is happy, and I am happy.</li>
    <li> Cleans my teeth nicely</li>
    <li> if you like your Oral-B electric tooth brush, these same-branded replacement brush heads fit perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;(5 more words required to post this)</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush.  Very fast and it makes me mouth feel super clean.  I just bought another for my mom.</li>
    <li> I tried these brush heads as my teeth are sensitive. First off it did not help the sensitive teeth, they were still sensitive. Second I did not feel my teeth were clean enough and soon after felt I needed to brush them again. I think they are meant more for people with sensitive gums not teeth. I had to order more of the precision clean brush heads so I could feel good about brushing my teeth.</li>
    <li> THey feel less harsh than the standard issue</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with the quality.</li>
    <li> Soft bristles, cleans very gently.</li>
    <li> Great brushes, but is a little expensive without sales.  Is softer than other oral b brushes and easier on gum.</li>
    <li> I have had surgery on one tooth for gum recession. The doctor told me to use less abrasive toothpaste and these brush heads. I am very happy with them and will order them again.</li>
    <li> Non OEM fits perfect. This is good quality at much Lower price. A good buy as these are required every 3 months</li>
    <li> Great price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Love this replacement brushes and it&#x27;s so much cheaper than Rite Aid and other retailers!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what my dentist has been suggesting me to use.  It&#x27;s really hard to find something specific like this at a reasonable price.  The soft brush don&#x27;t scratch my teeth&#x27;s enamel so much. I love it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know brushing my teeth could be this comfortable and still get the job done properly.  I&#x27;m very happy with these, so much so, that I bought a second pack.  I do wish they came in in larger packs though. I recently  had trouble finding the Oral-B brushes I usually use, so I tried a similar non-Oral-B brand.  Unlike some, they fit my toothbrush fine, but the sound the motor started making indicated that it was working very hard. I was afraid my toothbrush motor was going to die.  My husband has tried a different brand.  It works, but is so loose he has it taped to the toothbrush.  So I&#x27;m sticking to the Oral-B brand, and I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve accidently discovered the brushes for sensitive teeth, which mine are, at least right now.  I recommend them for anyone with sensitive teeth issues.</li>
    <li> The head is easy on the gums and removes debris that cause plaque quite well.  If you have receding gums you should use this brush head.</li>
    <li> I chose the five star rating because Oral-B toothbrush heads are terrific.  They do not irritate my gums.  They are comfortable -- effective cleaning, yet gentle.  I had begun using the Oral-B toothbrush due to my dentist recommendation.  I chose the sensitive heads due to the comfort level I experience.  Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I rated it a 4 rather than a 5 because there may be other heads that work even better, but I&#x27;ve been using the same model for years &amp; it does a really good job of cleaning your teeth, partly because it utilizes a timer to let you know when two minutes are up, which makes it more likely that you won&#x27;t do just a cursory brushing as we all tend to do with a standard brush.  I actually brush for four minutes, which gets very messy, while I do a series of strengthening exercises at the bathroom.  I would recommend this to anyone who is serious about avoiding gum disease.</li>
    <li> Initially I thought, should i buy online or go to shop to grab it. But I&#x27;m happy with my deal and found these Brushes as good as i wanted.</li>
    <li> Using brushes daily can be hard on the gums.  As I have gotten older I appreciate a product like this that both cleans the teeth and gums but does not contribute to gum erosion.</li>
    <li> Well it&#x27;s a brush head what can I say? If your looking for a brush head that is soft on your gums this is perfect for you.  My only complain it seems like the bristles tend to ware out quicker then regular ones.  But I would purchase these again.</li>
    <li> These brushes suit my mouth &amp;#34;to a T&amp;#34;.  They do not bother my sensitive gums at all and my teeth feel nice and clean!</li>
    <li> Fit brush well, just not as soft as I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> Item has not been used, yet, but arrived as described. Name brand, new and correct product. Those looking for a name brand sensitive replacement head, this it it. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Replace brush heads every other month for best results</li>
    <li> Not only did I try the generic-2 companies and they both had issues....my gums bleed, they never bleed and that right there told me enough and confirmed with my dentist he showed me a bristle lodged in the rear of my mouth and I thought it was a cavity. I then told him what I did he explained why oral b is oral b. he said trying to use generic on the teeth isn&#x27;t worth it period.e said it would have been better than to use a replacement head so I got a deal from amazon on the orqal b and they fit my type which is the cheap one it says oral b and braun on it and is a basic charging stand with light and I just tried it and it runs perfecdt and feels like an oral b in my mouth.</li>
    <li> Great. So much better and recommended by my Periodontist to care for my gums without damaging the roots</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a new toothbrush, and got this extra &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; for a spare. Love it and it is great for my sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> it does not clean as well as the other oral B brush heads. it is a waist of time using this product.</li>
    <li> I replaced the \\&quot;Floss Action\\&quot; head on my Smartseries 5000 with this \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; brush head.  The rotating part is taller, narrower, and much softer than the floss-action-- it feels better on my teeth, more like brushing and a lot less like a mechanical device is giving my teeth a beating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B brush heads fit most Oral-B toothbrushes, so you can switch between types of head easily.  This one feels more \\&quot;snug\\&quot; (harder to pull off) than the Floss Action which came with the brush. Especially if you floss anyway, the sensitive heads are easier on your mouth and seem to work just as well.</li>
    <li> works very well very satisfied</li>
    <li> great quality, but priced too high !!</li>
    <li> Awesome!!  These actually work.  My previous order for replacement heads from another vendor did not work at all.  I strongly suggest you stick with the Oral B brand for replacement heads.  It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> extra soft bristles for my toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;love them.&lt;br /&gt;good value from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes.  They do a fair job at cleaning but mostly they are small enough so I can reach all the back teeth without gagging.  For a good clean, I use a stronger brush at night but it&#x27;s not as comfortable.</li>
    <li> My favorite replacement for my Oral-B Precision Black 7000. I tried the others like the normal one (one that comes for free), prowhite and floss action replacements but they were all too harsh. This one is just perfect! It has soft bristles and i&#x27;ve never encountered any problems while using this even if I &amp;#34;accidentally&amp;#34; brush too hard, which I can&#x27;t say about the other replacements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stocked a lot of these that would probably last me 2 years, that&#x27;s how much I love it.</li>
    <li> Great brush heads!  These work well on my sensitive teeth!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll only ever purchase these as long as they are made.  Much more gentle on my aging teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> exactly what it was suppose to be at just about the best price available.</li>
    <li> These are great! Very gentle on my sensitive teeth.  All toothbrushes should be this gentle.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive gums, especially near the inside front teeth.  These soft bristles are the best I&#x27;ve ever had.  Sonicare is a better cleaning machine, but if your mouth is pretty clean already, or have sensitive gums, this brush works very well, and is very gentle.</li>
    <li> I think that if Oral-B had been around when I was a child, I&#x27;d never have needed a filling! OK, maybe a bit of an exaggeration, but the Oral-B electronic toothbrush that I have keeps my teeth smooth, generally free of tartar, and with healthy gums. I have tried several brush types from Oral-B and found that I prefer the Extra-Soft brush heads. My local stores, including the big box stores, usually have these available, but Amazon had a better price and, by bundling, I was able to have free shipping. The brushes last about 3 months, but you can probably get 4 months&#x27; use. I&#x27;m very pleased with both the Oral-B handle unit and these brushes. So, if you are thinking about trying these, go ahead with confidence. The brushes are soft, but not too soft. They are a good replacement for the original brush that came with the unit when it was new. Whether you choose the standard brush or the extra soft will be an individual decision. As an older adult, I find the extra soft to be more comfortable on my gums.</li>
    <li> Fully meets my tooth brushing needs.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy again, especially if the price were a bit lower.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find these in the stores.  Had to have the extra-soft heads.  Also much cheaper to purchase online. Will continue to buy online when needed.</li>
    <li> Love the price and quality of these.  They fit our electric toothbrushes.  My hygienist really sees the difference with these.</li>
    <li> There are a lot of fakes out there. This is the real deal. Works great. Do not hesitate to buy this product</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find these brush heads at the store. Once I got them in the mail, I immediately brushed my teeth and was so glad I bought them! They&#x27;re extra-soft.</li>
    <li> I tried other brands but Oral-B is the only one that fits properly and is sensitive.</li>
    <li> Soft but not weak, gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Good quality as always, more variety in USA than New Zealand. Delivery is quick, right to our door, the globe is small.</li>
    <li> Love Oral B and if you have sensitive gums this is great.</li>
    <li> I like the sensitive heads much more than the regular ones. I had gum grafts a year or two ago and am sensitive to the harder brushes. One way I know it&#x27;s time to change the head on this toothbrush is when the bristles are feeling noticeably hard! So, I guess the sensitive heads are at least subconsciously better.</li>
    <li> Best tooth brush ever! I actually bought these replacement heads because they are cheaper than buying them else where at any retail store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought other ones as well but they cannot compare to this one. its small but big enough to reach all the surfaces of your tooth if you move your tooth brush around.</li>
    <li> Great! Njust the right size I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Very hard to find this brush extra soft at any price. This price is also a welcome bargain. Been using this Oral B brush for over 10 years and my dental hygienist is always happy with my dental care.</li>
    <li> My hubby and I both have sensitive teeth, and these replacement heads are just the thing for us.  Had gotten so that even using sensitive toothpaste with the regular heads wasn&#x27;t helping.  But these really have made all the difference.  The pricing is substantially better than what i can find locally.</li>
    <li> my sensitive mounth is very happy</li>
    <li> Happy checkups with regular daily use combined with flossing and a fluoride rinse.</li>
    <li> Ok, I&#x27;ve tried the cheap ones and they are NO Match for the Real Thing!!!  The others failed after only about 3 brushings, springs were to thin and they just didn&#x27;t last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral B are the only ones I will ever purchase from now on.</li>
    <li> It may be a small head but the bristles feel dense enough to do a really good job.  Love it</li>
    <li> Holds charge well, keeps teeth clean, is easy to use, and it can use various interchangeable brush heads. These include floss action, sensitive, regular, etc. Has 5 different brushing modes which deffinately makes for an interesting brushing experiance. Works way better than a regular manual toothbrush at mantaining healthy teeth and gums. It is well manufactured, and so far this has been a good product.</li>
    <li> Perfect, I just love it, Just the way I thought it would be, works good.</li>
    <li> I ordered these when I ordered our Precision 1000 toothbrush unit.  I&#x27;m glad I ordered these soft bristled brushes as I would imagine the standard ones would tear my gums up.  I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few weeks, so don&#x27;t know how it will hold up, but we are very happy so far.</li>
    <li> Works great in my electric bush.  Thanks!  Great value, as good as original heads that came with product.  Thank you again.</li>
    <li> These work great just as good as the normal toothbrush. really good deal. I highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> I use this on my Braun toothbrush and it works fine.  There don&#x27;t seem to be Braun replacements anymore.  Good quality.</li>
    <li> have always had oral b  toothbrushes &amp; intensely dislike this one - for the ist time.</li>
    <li> great toothbrushes fit great do the job leaves that great  sensation after brushing</li>
    <li> GOTTA HAVE REPLACEMENT</li>
    <li> Works as described. I like it.</li>
    <li> These fit our Oral-B electric toothbrushes; I think we have 3 different ones and they fit them all.  My husband has very sensitive teeth and receding gums and this brush works especially well for him.  The sensitive brush head is smaller and gentler on the gums and hopefully keeps tartar at bay. The smaller brush works better because you can angle the brush and get the bristles in between the teeth. He says the brush starts getting soft in about a month but he ends up changing it in about three months, so a three pack is a good deal.</li>
    <li> They work fine,not sure what you can really write about a toothbrush head other then that.</li>
    <li> These keep my teeth clean without hurting.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why these aren&#x27;t more widely available, but they are great.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- softer bristles are gentle on the gumline and reduce wear on exposed roots&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- none that I can tell.</li>
    <li> Oral-B Sensitive Replacement Electric toothbrush replacements are great.  They fit snugly on my existing Oral-B electric toothbrush and easily clean my teeth to almost dentist-cleaning level..  One suggestion is not to press the bristles hard on your teeth when using these electric toothbrush replacements. It prevents the bristles from effectively cleaning between your teeth.</li>
    <li> Very good at a good price.</li>
    <li> A good bargain and sturdy replacement brushes.  I read the warnings by some reviewers and made sure these brushes weren&#x27;t knockoffs but genuine Oral-B brushes.</li>
    <li> This is the most reasonably priced place to find original replacement heads.  The after-market heads I&#x27;ve tried don&#x27;t fit quite as well and for me, the extra cost is worth it.</li>
    <li> 3 stars for overall experience.  These are the greatest brush heads on earth IMESHO, but why can&#x27;t I buy more than 3 at a time and save a bit of money?</li>
    <li> Does the job with no problem.</li>
    <li> They work great. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> arrived in good order and worked as expectedd</li>
    <li> Best for people with dental work and/or tender tissue.</li>
    <li> Works great and is soft on my gums, but all the bristles are the same length so it can be a little difficult to keep the bristles in one spot for long.  Overall these are my favorite brush heads because they&#x27;re soft.</li>
    <li> Great and gentle on gums (remember to clean your gums!).</li>
    <li> These are very soft and cleans pretty nicely. But they cannot reach in between teeth properly for cleaning. But still pretty good!</li>
    <li> The sensitive brushes, like the regular ones, work well.  But the price is exorbitant.  It reminds me of computer printers; they are priced low, but you get stuck paying for them when you buy replacement ink cartridges.</li>
    <li> Love our Oral B Bruan, but think the cost of replacement heads is outrageous. They do a great job but it always pains us to have to buy and replace.</li>
    <li> First electric brush, these heads work as described. No problems, clean teeth, I will let my next dental appointment be the real test.</li>
    <li> Perfect for sensitive teeth, gets teeth and gingiva clean without pain.  Using for years and very pleased with these brushes, used with Oral B vitality electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> just what it describes</li>
    <li> Great Brushes. great price</li>
    <li> Took some getting used to at first, since I was used to the regular manual toothbrush.  The head was so small, it felt like it was more tedious to brush your teeth.  But it&#x27;s been several months now, and I&#x27;ve gotten used to the size and I love it.</li>
    <li> For some reason I haven&#x27;t been able to find the soft brush heads in stores, so I&#x27;m glad I was able to find it here. Strong enough to get your teeth and gums clean, but sensitive enough to provide a comfortable brushing experience.</li>
    <li> I have been using the oral b for over 10 years. The system is great.. But with the reg hard brushes, my gums were receding.. And that does not grow back ... So these were a great solution.</li>
    <li> Finally!  Tooth brush heads that don&#x27;t make my gums bleed.  So thrilled to have these!  Look forward to brushing my teeth now.  What a difference!  I am thrilled.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth and these heads are amazing.  My dentist has informed me that my teeth never looked better.  I can not say enough great things about these brush heads.</li>
    <li> as she got very sensitive gums so for her they work much better then philips interplack so I defintly recomend it for any one with sentive gums</li>
    <li> The bristles are a bit too soft. I know that we are looking at an extra soft tooth brush, and I do like extra soft usually. But this one is crazy soft. It seems like it won&#x27;t last too long before wearing out.</li>
    <li> I love these soft tooth brushes by oral -b  I have had the electric brush for years, but I always had to use the harder brushes, my  mouth is very tender.. and will bleed  most of the time when I brush my teeth,, but with the new soft brushs no more bleeding. and they work great. and a good price as well. thanks Amazon..</li>
    <li> After years of buying the traditional toothbrush heads, I thought I would try these.  I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive gums, but my dentist has told me I am at a higher risk of receding gums, so I thought these might help prevent further deterioration.  Anyway, this might sound crazy, but when I use these toothbrush heads, I find that the toothpaste doesn&#x27;t adhere to the brush long enough to cover my mouth.  Usually it will stick to the first couple of teeth I brush and then remain there for the rest of the time.  That usually means that I&#x27;m brushing the rest of my mouth with the bubbles built up from those initial teeth (versus from the toothpaste itself).  It&#x27;s disappointing and annoying every time, so I plan to return to the other brush heads for my next purchase.</li>
    <li> I have been using these brush heads for years at the suggestion of my dentist.  These are hard to find and purchase, thankful that Amazon has these brush heads and hope it continues.&lt;br /&gt;Received timely and in good condition, the price is fair.</li>
    <li> What can I say, its a toothbrush refill?  However, I will say that they&#x27;re genuine, as a lot of bad knockoffs are available.</li>
    <li> I ran out of these and used the regular ones that came with my electric toothbrush.  Bad move on my part.  My gums were hurting and bleeding pretty bad. In short, I was really happy when these arrived in the mail a few days after ordering.  Thank goodness for prime shipping.</li>
    <li> my scleroderma mouth loves them will order more</li>
    <li> These heads are softer and cause less gum irritation that the original brush heads.  They are gentle on enamel, but get the job done.</li>
    <li> I needed these and to buy local was gonna cost me quite a bit more, definitely a good buy on these</li>
    <li> Very good product. Nice if you need a gentler  brush that does not hurt the gums. I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> These brushes work well and remove stains from my teeth without damaging my gums. These soft brush heads are good for everyone&#x27;s teeth.</li>
    <li> These brush heads are are a god send to my gums. They are not too hard on the gums or teeth and most importantly they clean very well. Very happy with the softer brush heads. The price is also a great value.</li>
    <li> Have tried the basic heads that come with my toothbrush. They hurt the gums. This is EXCELLENT for my sensitive gums!</li>
    <li> It works very well---it is a keeper</li>
    <li> I love my Oral B electric toothbrush. These are just replacement brush heads - nothing special about them - but they&#x27;re the right ones and convenient to buy from Amazon.</li>
