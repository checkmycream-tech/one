      <li>This cream is simply the best moisturizer available today...</li>
      <li>So, therefore, I searched for it on Amazon and was so very pleasantly surprised and happy to find this valuable hand cream on the website.  </li>
      <li>This cream is fantastic and I love that it comes in tubes-</li>
      <li>I find that it works best for me to avoid using harsh hand soaps and to make sure I always have my Cetaphil wherever I go.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very mild on the skin and did not make me breakout.</li>
      <li>The more you use, the more is absorbed into your tissues.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone, from people who just want good lotion to those with skin conditions (e.g. psoriasis, eczema).   </li>
      <li>One of the best things is that it doesn&#x27;t have a heavy, clinging fragrance.</li>
      <li>Wish it was cheaper though, but Cetaphil isn&#x27;t cheap to start with.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s dirt cheap.  </li>
      <li>Recommended by my dermatologist with free samples.</li>
      <li>It feels really light on your skin.</li>
      <li>Glad I can purchase it more reasonably at Amazon.</li>
      <li>Love their whole line of skin care!</li>
      <li>Worth it!</li>
      <li>Not fancy, but we works great on dry skin...incl.</li>
      <li>Lucky for me</li>
      <li>It is unscented and is very easy on my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I believe it&#x27;s the very best solution to dry, red chapped hands.  </li>
      <li>It is easily absorbed even though it&#x27;s a cream and not a lotion, and is non greasy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Aveeno with some success, since it&#x27;s unscented, as is this.</li>
      <li>and I think its worth it.  </li>
      <li>It is a cream, so it&#x27;s thick, but if you use just a dallop, it&#x27;s not greasy or sticky and works good under makeup!</li>
      <li>It is silky smooth, gentle, fragrance free, and absorbs quickly to leave my hands feeling soft and moisturized.  </li>
      <li>This cream helps heal the redness right up and prevents the peeling, without making me breakout.  </li>
      <li>While this is a great product it doesn&#x27;t make dry skin go away completely like others have claimed.</li>
      <li>i like cetaphil very much which can control baby&#x27;s eczema</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this for over ten years and it is the best for dry skin anywhere on the body that might be sensitive, including the face.</li>
      <li>We love this lotion, if you buy the actual lotion instead of cream, it doesn&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
      <li>However when I went to reorder Amazon had really raised the price!</li>
      <li>I use it daily and am so pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to get Cetaphil Cream in a tube and this size is very handy for travel.</li>
      <li>I just love it but was very upset when locally couldn&#x27;t find any trace of this product on the store shelves.  </li>
      <li>I was very joyfully happy to order it and hope it will never go off the market because I am planning to be purchasing this very hand cream for a long, long time to come.  </li>
      <li>I especially like the way it is dispensed which allows me to travel with it easily.  </li>
      <li>It lacks a strong smell and works equally well on faces, knees and elbows.    </li>
      <li>I swim several times a week and my dermatologist strongly recommended using this cream.</li>
      <li>And now it is used for our whole famalily.</li>
      <li>I can never find it in the stores in tubes, which are so much easier for getting lotion out without getting it under your nails.  </li>
      <li>Thanks,</li>
      <li>This is not lotion, at all, which is very watery.  </li>
      <li>It is not oily, no matter how much I use, and it has done wonders for my legs.  </li>
      <li>Recommend highly!</li>
      <li>Keeps my face moisturized the whole day without the need to re apply during the day.</li>
      <li>and I really like.  </li>
      <li>These are great for dry, dermatitis-prone, sensitive skin, especially if you wash your hands frequently.  </li>
      <li>These little tubes are great since I can toss them in my bag for dry hands.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve spent more than I&#x27;d like to admit on many different facial creams</li>
      <li>It is a little thicker than most lotions, but not thick like creams, so she feels it works better for her dry skin, without feeling sticky.</li>
      <li>I found the main advantage in this as opposed to Aveeno</li>
      <li>When I searched, I was actually looking for smaller jars, but the tubes will work even better for travel.   </li>
      <li>I have mild eczema and my dermatologist recommended this lotion to help keep my skin moisturized and keep the eczema from coming back.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I smooth it on in the morning and find that at the end of the day my skin is still very soft and not at all dry.</li>
      <li>For the camper, in travel bag, in the car, etc... Makes it easy for her to have several around without blowing a ton of cash on the larger jars.</li>
      <li>Facial moisturiser with adequate FPS 15 for daily use for both men and women.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;Suki pure facial moisture-balancing moisturizer&amp;#34</li>
      <li>cream for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
      <li>I have combination, sensitive, acne prone skin.  </li>
      <li>It would go in the suitcase and last a whole trip.</li>
      <li>It is fragrance free and it doesn&#x27;t make your face feel sticky or heavy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice because I can use it all the time without getting tired of an overpowering scent.</li>
      <li>I am very grateful for this product, especially in very dry winters of Flagstaff, Arizona.</li>
      <li>Amazon is never empty and never closed..    </li>
      <li>I use it several times a day on my hands, and it really keeps my skin from getting too dry and cracked, especially helpful in the winter.</li>
      <li>In addition to dry, my skin is very sensitive and allergy prone as well.</li>
      <li>Not only do I have super oily skin, but my topical acne creams make some areas of my face raw and peeling.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used cetaphil for years for my dry sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I have dry sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I get extremely dry, itchy skin since I live in New England and am often outside in harsh weather.</li>

<li> I get extremely dry, itchy skin since I live in New England and am often outside in harsh weather.</li>
<li> At my local stores I&#x27;ve been buying this product for a very long time but at some point I couldn&#x27;t locate this hand cream.  </li>
<li> This cetaphil moisturizing cream is the only product I have found that doesn&#x27;t make my hands break out if they are already dry and cracked.  </li>
<li> Seriously, I use this at night, I use it under my sunscreen in the morning (incidentally, EltaMD UV Clear is not too shabby for sensitive skin), I use it around my eyes before using Retin-A to protect them.  </li>
<li> I keep a big jar of it on my bathroom vanity to use on my face, neck, hands, elbows and anywhere else that needs a little extra moisture.    </li>
<li> Ir soaks into my skin quickly without leaving a greasy or oily feel and the effects last longer than other more expensive and less expensive moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried.   </li>
<li> I have extremely dry legs and tried this product because it was recommended by my dermatologist.  </li>
<li> I have dry skin on my hands</li>
<li> My next favorite moisturizer is Murad, followed by one of the least expensive Avon creams.    </li>
<li> I typically buy this product at my local cvs/walgreens etc..</li>
<li> It beats every other mainstream brand and isn&#x27;t even super expensive.</li>
<li> Be careful what you order.  </li>
<li> I use Cetaphil as the base, especially on my face, because it doesn&#x27;t clog the pores, then I put on Vaseline intensive care on top.  </li>
<li> So I am disgusted to find myself stuck with a quantity of a product that is designed to treat dry skin without concern for exposing me to far greater health risks.</li>
<li> I recently moved from nyc to az and noticed that my skin became even drier due to the hard water and dry air...</li>
<li> is it&#x27;s extremely moisturizing.</li>
<li> I can understand the 3.0 ounce package because it fits in my carry-on, but there&#x27;s no reason other than greed, that Cetaphil no longer makes the 8 oz tube.  </li>
<li> Thanks a lot for the deceptive labeling, Cetaphil, Amazon and lousy recommendation from my doctor.</li>
<li> I highly recommend this hand cream for anyone who has terribly dry, red or even bloody type of skin issues.  </li>
<li> I look forward to using this during the coming harsh winter.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not at all too heavy though, or sticky and it absorbs well.</li>
<li> since almond oil is one of the ingredients, but is not easily noticeable, in case that&#x27;s not to your liking.</li>
<li> This is a cream type of product which is very thick and stays on for a long time.  </li>
<li> As usual the product melts into my skin and replenishes my skin&#x27;s moisture layer</li>
<li> It is now hard to find in drugstores</li>
<li> You should at least try it out.  </li>
<li> I have been using Cetaphil for a long time and have not been disappointed.  </li>
<li> It has a faint smell of almonds(which</li>
<li> You would never go wrong.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i like cetaphil very much which can control baby&#x27;s eczema, no smell, it is safty to baby for use.And now it is used for our whole famalily. i will pay more attention on it.</li>
    <li> this is by far the greatest moisturizer around. i love this product. the 3 ounce tubes you can take anywhere too.</li>
    <li> This is the different product thn what i was expecting.</li>
    <li> This cream is the best for my combination skin.  Not only do I have super oily skin, but my topical acne creams make some areas of my face raw and peeling.  This cream helps heal the redness right up and prevents the peeling, without making me breakout.  It is a cream, so it&#x27;s thick, but if you use just a dallop, it&#x27;s not greasy or sticky and works good under makeup!</li>
    <li> Product is as described.</li>
    <li> This is the best for sensitive skin, no matter what else I try I always come back.</li>
    <li> Handy sizes. For the camper, in travel bag, in the car, etc... Makes it easy for her to have several around without blowing a ton of cash on the larger jars.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only moisturizer I use</li>
    <li> This cream is simply the best moisturizer available today...non greasy, great texture, penetrating but my skin absorbs it nicely.  I especially like the way it is dispensed which allows me to travel with it easily.  It is now hard to find in drugstores so I am thrilled that I can get it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I use the big jar at home, but the tube size is perfect when I am traveling. I use Cetaphil as the base, especially on my face, because it doesn&#x27;t clog the pores, then I put on Vaseline intensive care on top.  That combination moisturizes longer without clogging.</li>
    <li> I have eczema and have used cetaphil cream and lotion since my teens.  I recently moved from nyc to az and noticed that my skin became even drier due to the hard water and dry air...so I had to get the cream to replace the cetaphil lotion I was using. As usual the product melts into my skin and replenishes my skin&#x27;s moisture layer..love this stuff..</li>
    <li> This is by far the greatest skin cream I have used. It beats every other mainstream brand and isn&#x27;t even super expensive. One of the best things is that it doesn&#x27;t have a heavy, clinging fragrance. It is easily absorbed even though it&#x27;s a cream and not a lotion, and is non greasy. It has a faint smell of almonds(which I love) since almond oil is one of the ingredients, but is not easily noticeable, in case that&#x27;s not to your liking. I look forward to using this during the coming harsh winter.</li>
    <li> I get extremely dry, itchy skin since I live in New England and am often outside in harsh weather. I have all kinds of lotion, and for some reason never tried Cetaphil. I bought this and it&#x27;s now the only thing I use--it&#x27;s that good! In addition to dry, my skin is very sensitive and allergy prone as well. I&#x27;ve used Aveeno with some success, since it&#x27;s unscented, as is this. I found the main advantage in this as opposed to Aveeno is it&#x27;s extremely moisturizing. I smooth it on in the morning and find that at the end of the day my skin is still very soft and not at all dry. It&#x27;s the longest-lasting lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried. It&#x27;s not at all too heavy though, or sticky and it absorbs well. It&#x27;s nice because I can use it all the time without getting tired of an overpowering scent. I would highly recommend this to anyone, from people who just want good lotion to those with skin conditions (e.g. psoriasis, eczema).   These little tubes are great since I can toss them in my bag for dry hands.</li>
    <li> We love this lotion, if you buy the actual lotion instead of cream, it doesn&#x27;t work as well.  I can never find it in the stores in tubes, which are so much easier for getting lotion out without getting it under your nails.  Plus, i can keep a tube in the diaper bag, and it works as a great distraction as i&#x27;m putting lotion on(baby loves to chew on the tube).  Wish it was cheaper though, but Cetaphil isn&#x27;t cheap to start with.</li>
    <li> Moisturizers come in three forms - lotions, creams, and ointments (in order of lightest/least greasy to heaviest/most greasy). Cetaphil makes a lotion and cream. I&#x27;ve found the Cetaphil cream to be my favorite moisturizer to use regularly - it has the best balance between hydrating effect and not being too greasy. I use it several times a day on my hands, and it really keeps my skin from getting too dry and cracked, especially helpful in the winter.</li>
    <li> I typically buy this product at my local cvs/walgreens etc.. but since finding it on Amazon with the deal i receive by buying in a 3pack.  I no longer have to go search for it, and sometimes at the local pharmacy its not even on the shelves..  Lucky for me Amazon is never empty and never closed..    Thanks,</li>
    <li> Having been struggling with a hand condition where my handscrack and bleed, and having tried products like [[ASIN:B00121UVU0 O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Working Hands Creme, Grip Pack 3.4 oz.]], AD moisturizing cream, and ointments at night, I find Cetaphil to be the best.  It is silky smooth, gentle, fragrance free, and absorbs quickly to leave my hands feeling soft and moisturized.  I find that it works best for me to avoid using harsh hand soaps and to make sure I always have my Cetaphil wherever I go.  I&#x27;ve been paying $10 per tube at a local pharmacy and I think its worth it.  That being said, Im glad to see that Amazon sells it for a much better price.</li>
    <li> These are great for dry, dermatitis-prone, sensitive skin, especially if you wash your hands frequently.  I keep one in my purse and one on my desk, and when we travel I use it as a body cream as well as a hand cream.</li>
    <li> At my local stores I&#x27;ve been buying this product for a very long time but at some point I couldn&#x27;t locate this hand cream.  I believe it&#x27;s the very best solution to dry, red chapped hands.  I just love it but was very upset when locally couldn&#x27;t find any trace of this product on the store shelves.  So, therefore, I searched for it on Amazon and was so very pleasantly surprised and happy to find this valuable hand cream on the website.  I was very joyfully happy to order it and hope it will never go off the market because I am planning to be purchasing this very hand cream for a long, long time to come.  This is not lotion, at all, which is very watery.  This is a cream type of product which is very thick and stays on for a long time.  I highly recommend this hand cream for anyone who has terribly dry, red or even bloody type of skin issues.  You should at least try it out.  I hope anyone trying this product will be completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used cetaphil for years for my dry sensitive skin.  It was recommended to my by my dermatologist.  Love their whole line of skin care!</li>
    <li> Good product and without a scent.</li>
    <li> The moisturizing cream continues to be one of my skin care essentials.</li>
    <li> I was so glad to find this product in a travel size.</li>
    <li> I needed the smaller tubes to carry outside as the tubs are too big (but cheaper).&lt;br /&gt;Good cream for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Wish it is cheaper though.</li>
    <li> Price very surprising, I did not hesitate to buy. Because I know it&#x27;s very good, as a person in charge of the brand, has been has a good reputation</li>
    <li> I like that I can buy on amazon in a three pack, for cheaper, because my daughter loves these.  It is a little thicker than most lotions, but not thick like creams, so she feels it works better for her dry skin, without feeling sticky.</li>
    <li> I cannot sing the praises of this moisturizer enough.  I have combination, sensitive, acne prone skin.  It reacts to everything.  It breaks out from everything.  It doesn&#x27;t like anything............EXCEPT THIS!  Not only that, but it&#x27;s dirt cheap.  Seriously, I use this at night, I use it under my sunscreen in the morning (incidentally, EltaMD UV Clear is not too shabby for sensitive skin), I use it around my eyes before using Retin-A to protect them.  I love that I can get this in a tube and keep it sanitary for using on my face.  Please please never stop making this!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to get Cetaphil Cream in a tube and this size is very handy for travel. Being 3.0 oz can be taken on a plane in a baggie!</li>
    <li> This cetaphil moisturizing cream is the only product I have found that doesn&#x27;t make my hands break out if they are already dry and cracked.  However when I went to reorder Amazon had really raised the price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve fallen in love with this cream in the jar.  It&#x27;s become my preferred moisurizer over much more expensive brands.    I keep a big jar of it on my bathroom vanity to use on my face, neck, hands, elbows and anywhere else that needs a little extra moisture.    We&#x27;ll be traveling soon and I didn&#x27;t want to lug a giant jar or scoop a portion of the jar into a smaller container for travel.  When I searched, I was actually looking for smaller jars, but the tubes will work even better for travel.   My next favorite moisturizer is Murad, followed by one of the least expensive Avon creams.    In my opinion, this stuff is superior to both of them.   Ir soaks into my skin quickly without leaving a greasy or oily feel and the effects last longer than other more expensive and less expensive moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried.   It lacks a strong smell and works equally well on faces, knees and elbows.    It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> O creme Cetaphil evita que a minha pele resseque muito. Trata-se de um excelente produto cujo uso recomendo a todos.</li>
    <li> Also recommended by Brazilian dermatologist. Facial moisturiser with adequate FPS 15 for daily use for both men and women. Worth it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product that really works.  I can understand the 3.0 ounce package because it fits in my carry-on, but there&#x27;s no reason other than greed, that Cetaphil no longer makes the 8 oz tube.  It would go in the suitcase and last a whole trip.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry legs and tried this product because it was recommended by my dermatologist.  I use it daily and am so pleased with the results.  It is not oily, no matter how much I use, and it has done wonders for my legs.  I have never used a better cream.</li>
    <li> It doesnt make me breakout, good for rosacea. It absorbs well to the skin.</li>
    <li> I have dry sensitive skin.  I have been using Cetaphil for a long time and have not been disappointed.  Recommend highly!</li>
    <li> I have a subscription for the 3 oz Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream because I can&#x27;t always find that size locally.  A package comes four times a year so I&#x27;m always well stocked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that size for airplane travel and to use after showering at the gym.  I swim several times a week and my dermatologist strongly recommended using this cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for over ten years and it is the best for dry skin anywhere on the body that might be sensitive, including the face.</li>
    <li> This cream is fantastic and I love that it comes in tubes- I don&#x27;t like the jar packaging. I&#x27;ve spent more than I&#x27;d like to admit on many different facial creams and this is the ONLY one I can use with Retin A Micro- it gets rid of the flakes and moisturizes well. I am very grateful for this product, especially in very dry winters of Flagstaff, Arizona.</li>
    <li> This product was delivered on time, however, it made me breakout more. I got more blemishes after using this stuff.It seems to have a greasy feel to it. I found that &amp;#34;Suki pure facial moisture-balancing moisturizer&amp;#34; works much better. It&#x27;s very mild on the skin and did not make me breakout.</li>
    <li> Bummed out. Recommended by my dermatologist with free samples. Nowhere were parabens listed. Although the amount that is toxic to our bodies is unknown, they are endocrine interruptors and implicated in problems with sexual development, birth defects and cancers. They are found in 99% of breast cancer tissue. The more you use, the more is absorbed into your tissues. So I am disgusted to find myself stuck with a quantity of a product that is designed to treat dry skin without concern for exposing me to far greater health risks. Thanks a lot for the deceptive labeling, Cetaphil, Amazon and lousy recommendation from my doctor.</li>
    <li> Great price on line and my husband swears by this lotion.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin on my hands and it still flakes after using this.  While this is a great product it doesn&#x27;t make dry skin go away completely like others have claimed.</li>
    <li> Wonderful on your skin. Keeps my face moisturized the whole day without the need to re apply during the day. It is fragrance free and it doesn&#x27;t make your face feel sticky or heavy. It feels really light on your skin. Highly recommended. Love Cetaphil line of products. You would never go wrong.</li>
    <li> excellent facial skin moisurizer</li>
    <li> By accident, it did not have Shea Butter (which I had wanted it to have).  Be careful what you order.  It comes with Shea which is much better.</li>
    <li> Great product recommended by my dermatologist.  Glad I can purchase it more reasonably at Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been using Cetaphil products for the last 15 years. These tubes are great to carry around and fit easily in my purse. The cream can be used on face or body. It is unscented and is very easy on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> My intention when buying this product was for a hand cream at work. Yes, it does moisturize, but I can&#x27;t touch anything for a good 15-20 minutes, which I do not think is a good aspect for a moisturizing cream to have.</li>
    <li> Very good moisturizing cream.</li>
    <li> Great travel size of the best ever moisturizer.  Not fancy, but we works great on dry skin...incl. face.</li>
    <li> I have mild eczema and my dermatologist recommended this lotion to help keep my skin moisturized and keep the eczema from coming back.  I&#x27;ve since been using this lotion for a couple months now and I really like.  I was happy to find  these 3 ounce tubes so that I can use for traveling and to keep in my purse and desk at work.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my doctor. Only time will tell if it helps my skin.</li>
