      <li>but this is good for deterring Suns signs of aging.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a good moisturizing face cream with UV protection.</li>

      <li>Good Product.  </li>
      <li>Good product.....appears to work well</li>

      <li>She told me that I do not have to spend a lot of money to buy good products</li>
      <li>I tried this product, and I like inmediatly, good sunscreen, no oily, my skin absorbs it in seconds.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>THE SMELL IS GOOD</li>
      <li>Good product with sun protection.  </li>
      <li>so I am a very satisfied customer despite the name.</li>
      <li>Works GREAT :)</li>
      <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>The latest bottle makes my skin look way too shiny!  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>anyone knows a better sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t cost $100 a bottle, I&#x27;d like to know!</li>
      <li>It is a very good product for my face and the most important thing is not greasy</li>
      <li>Eucerin Q10 Lotion is an amazing product.  </li>
      <li>it kind of made me creeped out.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have liked everything she has ever recommended, except this.</li>
      <li>I have tried many moisturizing, sun protecting lotions and this seems to be a really good value for its performance.</li>
      <li>nice and light, makes my skin feel great</li>
      <li>It feels okay on the skin and probably does a good job against the sun</li>
      <li>This comes close to minimizing these undesirable effects, but I guess it is needed to make the product effective.</li>
      <li>Makeup go on nicely over it as well.</li>
      <li>Nice creams for the protection or your screen</li>
      <li>and I really liked it.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m loving how it soaks in.</li>
      <li>Can be kind of oily</li>
      <li>It is also effective as a moisturizer</li>
      <li>Glad to get it for a good price from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Im sure the protection is good but its not for me.</li>
      <li>Best face lotion, and the spf in it definitely helps on this warm sunny days!</li>
      <li>This is my favorite kind.  </li>
      <li>it is light weight and effective no order and nice finish</li>
      <li>Good product, good price, fast shipping.</li>
      <li>This product is great for oily and sensitive skin as well - it goes on light and is great under makeup, and doesn&#x27;t make my face more oily or cause breakouts.</li>
      <li>The cream is indeed non-comedogenic and has very light texture.</li>
      <li>I used another brand with SPF 50 that I liked, but this one is non-greasy and rubs in fairly easily.  </li>
      <li>My skin is now acne free, moisturized and healthy!  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply, absorbs in a reasonable time, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy look or feel - good product at a good price.</li>
      <li>If I try to put foundation on top of it, it does make me break out.</li>
      <li>I love this lotion.</li>
      <li>takes a second to blend in, otherwise, perfect.</li>
      <li>Compared to the Aveeno with SPF 30, I like this one a lot better.  </li>
      <li>And maybe not even, because it just stays on top of your skin.</li>
      <li>Best of all, one squirt gets my entire face covered.</li>
      <li>I recommended it to my mom and she seems to be enjoying it as well.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Aveeno was okay, but it didn&#x27;t protect as well.</li>
      <li>This is perfect for daily wear, but for the beach or an outdoor workout, aim for something waterproof.</li>
      <li>I was Hesitating because wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;m going to like it.</li>
      <li>Though it has sunscreen, it still feels mostly like a moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Truthfully, I don&#x27;t like the name.  </li>
      <li>i love it</li>
      <li>even I realise it is safe.</li>
      <li>Most are oily and can damage contact lenses if it gets in your eyes.  </li>
      <li>I tried several \\&quot;beauty\\&quot; lotions with sunscreen in them, and Eucerin was the best.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff</li>
      <li>I love this moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I just love it.</li>
      <li>A fantastic  product!</li>
      <li>I sunburn in about 10 minutes, so I&#x27;ve tried many sunscreens.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for many years.</li>
      <li>using it for years - love it.</li>
      <li>There are definitely better moisturizers out on the market.</li>
      <li>This is an okay moisturizer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lighter than most, but even my skin (which tends to be a bit drier) felt hydrated by this lotion.</li>
      <li>As I see it, it will take many more laser treatments to, hopefully, undo the damage done by this product.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m satisfied now.</li>
      <li>I have super-sensitive Irish skin - and this is the best non-greasy moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
      <li>i love this face moisturizer.</li>
      <li>its so light and has spf!</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I love it :)</li>
      <li>Always a favorite.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product almost every day for two years, and I just love it.  </li>
      <li>Have used for many years.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t need a lotion AND a sunscreen now.</li>
      <li>I consider this the best facial sunscreen and insist the children put it on after they brush their teeth in the morning.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>It also has a nice light scent.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>To make it more moisturizing, I put a bit of oil or glycerin and hyaluronic lotion with it.</li>
      <li>This is the best daily moisturizer with 30 SPF I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>would love to love it, but</li>
      <li>skin feels healthy with this.</li>
      <li>Beiersdorf makes great products that are reasonable in cost, this is one of them.</li>
      <li>Most good options that have 30 or more SPF are very pricey.</li>
      <li>I have an oily skin and this lotion is perfect because absorbing so fast</li>
      <li>so I can apply/reapply it more freely during the day.</li>
      <li>It goes on light and does not look greasy or smell, as most sunscreen products do.</li>
      <li>Does not irritate skin and offers great sun protection.</li>
      <li>Okay, this lotion is fantastic for my face.</li>
      <li>i love it that it&#x27;s cheap</li>
      <li>:Good light weight,matte, non-comedogenic moisturizer suitable for sensitive and oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>Great product at such a cheap price!</li>
      <li>Nivea has a strong frangrance and feel it irritates my skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy to have broad spectrum SPF 30 protection that doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great so far - light, absorbs quickly, and I love that it&#x27;s got a halfway-decent SPF built in.</li>
      <li>it is looks very natural and provides good protection from the sun.</li>
      <li>Being a guy, I&#x27;m not used to putting on \\&quot;make-up\\&quot; daily, but this stuff is easy to apply, soaks in quickly, and more effective than even Bullfrog as a sunscreen!</li>
      <li>It still seems great as a sunblock, and, so far, I haven&#x27;t noticed more frequent breakouts, but the lotion feels much more slimy to me than it used to.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed an increase in acne, which is amazing because I&#x27;m very prone to breakouts.</li>
      <li>Great got facial sunblock</li>
      <li>great all over facial moisturizer/sunscreen to use in addition to this</li>
      <li>I put about two coats of this on my skin and it makes my skin silky smooth.</li>
      <li>10 minutes after putting it on, you don&#x27;t even realize its there because it&#x27;s light and nongreasy.</li>
      <li>I  ordered 5 to get free shipping</li>
      <li>Great product especially for the price.</li>
      <li>The one I purchased was lightweight and it did go on smooth and it is light-weight as advertised.</li>
      <li>10 minutes after putting it on, you don&#x27;t even realize its there because it&#x27;s light and nongreasy.  </li>
      <li>It is light and non-greasy.  </li>
      <li>Great daily moisturizer!</li>
      <li>Fantastic moisturizing lotion.</li>
      <li>So this is a good option that works well even for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>So far so good in that I haven&#x27;t noticed any breakouts from it or irritation either.</li>
      <li>cream goes in super easily.</li>
      <li>I wear it each day under makeup and even with my fair skin in the strong Colorado sun, I don&#x27;t get sunburned--even if I&#x27;m outside for hours.  </li>
      <li>Its ingredients are very safe for sensitive skin as well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s worth a shot in my opinion!</li>
      <li>Feels great and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>I was given a small trial sample of Eucerin and it works wonderfully.  </li>
      <li>It starts at lightweight and continues on to rich.</li>
      <li>It leaves your skin soft, healthy, moisturized,not greasy and with a very light scent of sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been out in the sun a lot since I bought this product</li>
      <li>A great moisturizer that really is for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>She has been using this lotion for a long time and she has a very nice skin.</li>
      <li>this is my second bottle from this amazing moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;it has SPF of 30 which is perfect for daily protection, fragrance free which is suitable for my sensitive skin and Parabens-free which is the first</li>
      <li>And I notice that when I wear it under my mineral makeup, the makeup seems to cake in spots of my face unless I make a special effort to blot up</li>
      <li>The product is excellent, hard to find in my area too.  </li>
      <li>My dermatologist insists I protect my fair skin by using sunscreen on my face daily.  </li>
      <li>Love the texture of this lotion, goes on very well, not greasy.  </li>
      <li>Good for acne and doesn&#x27;t make your eyes burn like cetaphil spf facial moisturizer.</li>
      <li>This product is nice for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>My skin is a nice tan and when I wear this on my face , it seems like I&#x27;m wearing two shades lighter than my natural color.</li>
      <li>Not a bad moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>but I gave this one a shot and have had no bad reaction to it.  </li>
      <li>My dermatologist no longer recommends this product to his patients and I feel very strongly that it should be recalled by the FDA, as it poses a significant threat to the very persons who would be most inclined to use it, those of us with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Though other people said the pump isn&#x27;t great and clogs, I never had that problem, the lotion comes out smoothly and easily, and I can put the right amount of pressure to get the right amount I want.</li>
      <li>and i have a darker skin tone but other than that its great</li>
      <li>I am a 37 year old female with very fair, Fitzgerald type</li>
      <li>A great contributing product to help maintain and to protect the body&#x27;s (young or old) 24/7 moisturizing balancing act.</li>
      <li>to get that high of an SPF, it uses oxides, you have to be sure and rub it in.</li>
      <li>As this product was promoted by my dermatologist and also approved by the American Academy of Dermatologists, I assumed it was a good choice and safe for my sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>So far so good this facial moisturizer has been doing good things to my sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
      <li>It really upset me !!  </li>
      <li>I really like it!!</li>
      <li>Love this moisterizer it makes my skin super soft</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and have been so happy that my dermatologist recommended Eucerin Daily Protection Moisturizing Face Lotion for my face.</li>
      <li>Eucerin is very gentle, mild frangrance if any and absorbs quickly.  </li>
      <li>Nice product for the price, although the zinc and titanium oxides in this product do leave the skin a little dry,&lt;br /&gt;it could use more vitamins/moisturizers.  </li>
      <li>I often wear it without makeup, and in the past, it gave my skin a nice matte look that I liked very much.  </li>
      <li>It goes on so light, and rubs in really well.</li>
      <li>I have really sensitive skin and most lotions irritate my face</li>
      <li>Good solid everyday protection at a good price.</li>
      <li>Also not heavy at all :)</li>
      <li>Plus it is economical.</li>
      <li>It has to be diluted with oil in order for it to be absorbed by my skin...</li>
      <li>Rub in an upwards circular motion and it will blend right in.</li>
      <li>The price was just right</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin that burns easily but tends to break out from the ingredients in SPF.</li>
      <li>and I have been happy using it for the past couple of years.</li>
      <li>I got this product from Walgreens and it serves all of my needs, it is fragrance free which is great because I don&#x27;t even realize I have it on during the day (unlike other spf facial products!).</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t stop my pimples and acnes coming out more n more everyday .</li>
      <li>its not very moisturizing so you might want to get a light lotion and apply this on top for sun protection</li>
      <li>This works really nicely without leaving me too dry or too greasy.</li>
      <li>This beats the higher priced sunscreens.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and I used to LOVE it, but now, I&#x27;d have to say I only \\&quot;like\\&quot; it.  </li>
      <li>The latest bottle I bought seems to feel like a slightly different product.  </li>
      <li>Yes, it does leave a white film, but I found that it soaks in when you use it on top of another moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>After applying the first time, I had to wash my face immediately.  </li>
      <li>Really!?)</li>
      <li>I wanted to like this so much!</li>
      <li>In the summer I do add a higher level of sun protection.</li>
      <li>I can definitely feel it when I touch my face, but it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy like most sunscreen - it just feels like the lotion never quite finished</li>
      <li>I went back to my favorite QV.</li>
      <li>It is a light weight moisturizer w/ SPF for sensitive skin in summer, but in winter, I would use a heavier or thicker moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I wish the SPF was higher--</li>
      <li>search for a facial moisturizer with SPF has come to an end with this product :)</li>
      <li>However, if I sweat in the first hour or so after putting it on, I will look like I&#x27;m sweating milk.</li>
      <li>I use it daily and have ordered it more than once from Amazon.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many face lotions and I keep coming back to this one for daytime use.  </li>
      <li>It sinks in nicely on my skin without any whiteish cast.</li>
      <li>Wish it came in a higher SPF version.</li>
      <li>Before that I was using Neutrogena Ultra Sheer, and this is better than that because it&#x27;s not as shiny, and never stings.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very convenient !</li>
      <li>I just tried this for the first time this week.</li>
      <li>Love the automatic daily face sun protection.  </li>
      <li>Even for fair skinned person white film is obvious and in no way you can use and not look a bit like a ghost.</li>
      <li>Because my skin is so dry, the next bottle I purchase will be more on the rich side because it absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>Its kind of oily and has a sun screen smell but should keep normal to dry skin moisturized.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this pretty much every day for about 3 years.</li>
      <li>i am 54 and sensitive to sunscreens but this one is light and does the work with a high spf.</li>
      <li>and I use a prescription cleanser for mild and sporadic adult acne.</li>
      <li>I was trying to get one that didn&#x27;t have such a strong sunscreen smell</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light, it absorbs easily, and I have neither broken out or burned once since using it, even on vacation under the hot Florida sun!</li>
      <li>Adds sufficient moisture for large % of my skin.</li>
      <li>It leaves a white residue but it gets absorbed quickly.</li>
      <li>and that is really saying something.</li>
      <li>/&gt;-It&#x27;s REALLY oily.</li>
      <li>maybe I really can&#x27;t use zinc oxide sunscreen on my face</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Despite this, I still really like this lotion.</li>
      <li>it does leave a while film but just rub it in real well</li>
      <li>The lotion is watery and it doesn&#x27;t really absorb into your skin.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>and I can really tell the difference.  </li>
      <li>Not yet used, but very like this brand</li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t even really moisturize my face but latched onto the oily areas of my face (like my nose)</li>
      <li>Moisturizing works well and its not irritating</li>
      <li>It was recommended by my dermatologist and is much cheaper here than in a drug store.</li>
      <li>I also found it didn&#x27;t moisturize very well for me.</li>
      <li>Too greasy on face, and it leaves white streaks on face if you don&#x27;t make sure you&#x27;ve COMPLETELY rubbed in every bit.</li>
      <li>Use a lighter more natural face lotion with spf 15 all over face and then apply this only to parts of your face that stick</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice for my skin, Thin and light cream, I will buy it again.</li>
      <li>Much to my surprise,  upon application the product quickly absorbed into my skin and it was not messy or greasy at all.</li>
      <li>But I am aware how important it is to protect the collagen in your skin from breaking down, especially in my twenties, to preserve healthy skin for the coming years.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, the good news is that this didn&#x27;t break me out or cause a weird rash, however I normally wear Vanicream which I love if I could get the lite lotion with an spf</li>
      <li>Quite frankly, I was not wild about using a moisturizer but the sun screen additive was fine.</li>
      <li>I have medium skin ( not dry and not oily, I&#x27;m lucky</li>
      <li>After spending hundreds if not thousands of dollars on drug store, department store and special order products I finally gave Eucerin a try - IT</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too thick, it&#x27;s light and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Paste and relaxed, not greasy, everyday can also prevent bask in effect, is suitable for the face</li>
      <li>Good, the only reason it&#x27;s not a 5 is because it is sorta oily when you put it on, but it takes a little while to absorb.</li>
      <li>She said similar things about being able to get by with only one squirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I guess its decent.</li>
      <li>After receiving V beam laser treatment for mild rosacea, I was advised by my dermatologist to wear sunblock on a regular basis.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this particular face lotion when I started to try and make all the products I use, not so chemically, plus it&#x27;s recommended by the cancer society...</li>
      <li>Aveeno burned my face, and I thought it was from the high SPF, but it must be from another ingredient, because I don&#x27;t have that problem with this one.</li>
      <li>If u r trying out products this will be the one to try before going high brands</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>My dermatologist highly recommends it.</li>
      <li>In certain lights you can clearly see where I have applied the product on my face.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t emphasize enough how gentle this sunscreen is!!  </li>
      <li>Like most face lotions with SPF, it takes a little longer to rub in with the added benefit of sunscreen.</li>
      <li>to make it even better, a little of this product goes a longggg way.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too rich for my combination skin, but works well for my tween daughter&#x27;s dry skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m normally allergic to the SPF creams</li>
      <li>As someone with super sensitive skin and rosacea, I am constantly on the prowl for a moisturizer with sunscreen that won&#x27;t aggravate my skin.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any antioxidants or other skin-improving additions (though the sunscreen is important), so I wear an antioxidant serum underneath.</li>
      <li>I was wondering why I began to get new breakouts.</li>
      <li>I went back and forth trying cleansers/ moisturizers for oily skin in an attempt to clear up the acne and cleansers/moisturizers for dry skin in an attempt to hydrate - nothing worked and most products</li>
      <li>Tried to make the most of it by using it as body sunscreen for the beach, but it became runny white streaks when I got wet.</li>
      <li>Not as lightweight as package information indicates, but still feels more lightweight than other similar products.</li>
      <li>I have zero irritation after putting it on, even around my sensitive eyes!  </li>
      <li>but it does leave a white residue probably more due to the sun block in it.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s because one full pump dispenses too much; only use about a half a pump on freshly washed skin</li>
      <li>, NOT THAT HEAVY, I LIKE IT, AND IT IS NOT SO STICKY, ABSORB EASILY.</li>
      <li>Although other reviewers were ok on this apparently i am not the one.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for a few years and is working out just fine.  </li>
      <li>But I guess it only works for certain people.</li>
      <li>BUT, it&#x27;s very hard to find a daily lightweight moisturizer that goes on so smoothly, is fragrance free, has an SPF of 30 and doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune -</li>
      <li>I do notice that it makes my face look a little more pinkish (even though the product is white)</li>
      <li>These should have been mentioned online and clearly on the packaging.  </li>
      <li>People guess I&#x27;m in my early 20s.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and used this all over my face</li>
      <li>I am an adult</li>
      <li>This is a light-weight moisturizer that works well on my sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>It feels like there is no heavy sunscreen,</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use the products that use chemical sunscreens - this uses minerals like zinc to block the rays.</li>
      <li>Instead of moisturizing it like it claims to do, it did the complete opposite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>My frequent use as the doctors tells me.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
      <li>I really like this lotion but the only downside is that my hands get sticky after applying it and cannot do it on the run.</li>
      <li>It irritates my eyes even though I don&#x27;t put it near the sensitive eye area.</li>
      <li>Also, it starts to flake off with my foundation near the end of the night.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no offensive SPF smell, and I can&#x27;t get over how soft my face feels.</li>
      <li>Recommended for a sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>So far my fav day to day moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now (not as consistently as I should, but fairly consistently) and have yet to run out.</li>
      <li>When I first put it on, I noticed the smell, exactly like sunscreen, and my face (which is already pale) looked like a ghost.</li>
      <li>On pale skin like mine, though, it doesn&#x27;t look white, it just makes my skin look better:</li>
      <li>Easy to use, no big mess.  </li>
      <li>Left white streaks on my face, which is slightly tan.&lt;br /&gt;Feels more like a sunscreen than a moisturizer</li>
      <li>main downside to this moisturizer is that it stays a bit white on your skin.</li>
      <li>I use just a little while my skin is still damp and it absorbs quickly; there is no greasy feel.</li>
      <li>In the new product description, only mineral sunscreens Titanium Dioxide and Zinc Oxide are mentioned.  </li>
      <li>Not greasy at all and very moisturizing to my dry skin.</li>
      <li>Works really well and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t get enough of it, my wife uses it daily and absolutely loves it...</li>
      <li>I wear it daily and haven&#x27;t had a problem even though I have very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Better than the most expensive products I have bought in the past, cannot compare to this Eucerin moisturizer/protect</li>
      <li>Caused major break out after 2 days of use.</li>
      <li>It also has broad spectrum SPF 30 sun protection in it.</li>
      <li>I recommend this highly for anyone looking for a daily sunscreen that&#x27;s not oily/heavy and actually works (imagine that!).</li>
      <li>Pretty disappointing for many reasons.</li>
      <li>I have tried the intense repair body lotion from Eucarin and it was way too heavy and left a greasy film on my skin, as well as breakouts in unusual places (a pimple on my KNEE?</li>
      <li>Eucerin Sensitive Facial  </li>
      <li>so I need just one small squirt to cover my face and neck, making the bottle last a long time which saves money :)</li>
      <li>Was surprised that it didn&#x27;t make my combination skin oily, especially in the t-zone - but after reading the reviews I decided to try it.  </li>
      <li>This is the only non-greasy sunscreen/moisturizer I&#x27;ve found that never stings on my sensitive skin, even on a cut that&#x27;s just been washed, or on sunburned skin.</li>
      <li>some &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; products use mineral sunscreens, too, like Lush&#x27;s &#x27;Feel Younger Skin Tint&#x27; and Skin79</li>
      <li>I experimented with using less, massaging the lotion in more, apply while my face is still a little damp, and nothing seems to work.</li>
      <li>I wanted a daily facial sunscreen with only mineral sunscreens, because many chemical sunscreens have been shown to negatively impact health and disrupt hormones.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but I will only use this sunblock on my face, since it never makes me feel sticky and gross.</li>
      <li>Thin, More like a lotion then a daily cream.</li>
      <li>It has a great consistency, not too thin and not too thick, so it keeps my skin moist.</li>
      <li>and I still have to work a little too hard to make sure that this product has completely disolved into my skin.  </li>
      <li>Also there is no strange smell.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive and dry skin.</li>
      <li>Tbh, I used this as Youtuber frmheadtotoe raved about how it worked for her sensitive and dry skin.</li>
      <li>If you are sensitive to sulfates in the smallest way, this product will definitely dry out your skin.</li>
      <li>i am 33years old dry</li>
      <li>/&gt;i gave this to my 63years old mother in law with dry skin and she loves it.</li>
      <li>After three months of using this product on a daily basis, my eyes became extremely sensitive due to the fumes emitted when I applied the product to my face and I developed conjunctivitis twice in one month; (the ophthalmologist who treated me assured me that the conjunctivitis was chemically induced and I had no reason to doubt him as I have no prior history of eye problems).  </li>
      <li>I live in a tropical climate, and it has saved me a few times when I am out in the sun unexpectedly.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s good product.  </li>
<li> I have not uesed it yet, looks good.</li>
<li> A good, clean-feeling moisturizer for problematic skin.</li>

<li> A good layer to use under make up, even if yours already has an SPF.</li>
<li> Good for my face.</li>
<li> Good stuff.</li>
<li> Good as a sunscreen.</li>
<li> and I have yet to get a sunburn on my face even when the rest of my body gets sunburnt(have yet to find a good body moisturizer with SPF).&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
<li> but this is good for deterring Suns signs of aging.</li>
<li> I was looking for a good moisturizing face cream with UV protection.</li>
<li> Been using it for a couple of years now, and it&#x27;s really good.</li>
<li> Non greasy and feels good on my face.  </li>
<li> and I bought this one based off the good amazon reviews:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> A good product and a good value.</li>
<li> Good Product.  </li>
<li> Good product.....appears to work well</li>
<li> and it just did not look good.</li>
<li> She told me that I do not have to spend a lot of money to buy good products</li>
<li> I tried this product, and I like inmediatly, good sunscreen, no oily, my skin absorbs it in seconds.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
<li> THE SMELL IS GOOD</li>
<li> Good product with sun protection.  </li>
<li> so I am a very satisfied customer despite the name.</li>
<li> Works GREAT :)</li>
<li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
<li> The latest bottle makes my skin look way too shiny!  </li>
<li> Love it!</li>
<li> I love it!</li>
<li> I love this stuff!</li>
<li> anyone knows a better sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t cost $100 a bottle, I&#x27;d like to know!</li>
<li> It is a very good product for my face and the most important thing is not greasy</li>
<li> Eucerin Q10 Lotion is an amazing product.  </li>
<li> it kind of made me creeped out.&lt;br</li>
<li> I have liked everything she has ever recommended, except this.</li>
<li> I have tried many moisturizing, sun protecting lotions and this seems to be a really good value for its performance.</li>
<li> nice and light, makes my skin feel great</li>
<li> It feels okay on the skin and probably does a good job against the sun</li>
<li> This comes close to minimizing these undesirable effects, but I guess it is needed to make the product effective.</li>
<li> Makeup go on nicely over it as well.</li>
<li> Nice creams for the protection or your screen</li>
<li> and I really liked it.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m loving how it soaks in.</li>
<li> Can be kind of oily</li>
<li> It is also effective as a moisturizer</li>
<li> Glad to get it for a good price from Amazon.  </li>
<li> Im sure the protection is good but its not for me.</li>
<li> Best face lotion, and the spf in it definitely helps on this warm sunny days!</li>
<li> This is my favorite kind.  </li>
<li> it is light weight and effective no order and nice finish</li>
<li> Good product, good price, fast shipping.</li>
<li> This product is great for oily and sensitive skin as well - it goes on light and is great under makeup, and doesn&#x27;t make my face more oily or cause breakouts.</li>
<li> The cream is indeed non-comedogenic and has very light texture.</li>
<li> I used another brand with SPF 50 that I liked, but this one is non-greasy and rubs in fairly easily.  </li>
<li> My skin is now acne free, moisturized and healthy!  </li>
<li> Easy to apply, absorbs in a reasonable time, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy look or feel - good product at a good price.</li>
<li> If I try to put foundation on top of it, it does make me break out.</li>
<li> I love this lotion.</li>
<li> takes a second to blend in, otherwise, perfect.</li>
<li> Compared to the Aveeno with SPF 30, I like this one a lot better.  </li>
<li> And maybe not even, because it just stays on top of your skin.</li>
<li> Best of all, one squirt gets my entire face covered.</li>
<li> I recommended it to my mom and she seems to be enjoying it as well.</li>
<li> I love it.</li>
<li> Aveeno was okay, but it didn&#x27;t protect as well.</li>
<li> This is perfect for daily wear, but for the beach or an outdoor workout, aim for something waterproof.</li>
<li> I was Hesitating because wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;m going to like it.</li>
<li> Though it has sunscreen, it still feels mostly like a moisturizer.</li>
<li> Truthfully, I don&#x27;t like the name.  </li>
<li> i love it</li>
<li> even I realise it is safe.</li>
<li> Most are oily and can damage contact lenses if it gets in your eyes.  </li>
<li> I tried several \\&quot;beauty\\&quot; lotions with sunscreen in them, and Eucerin was the best.  </li>
<li> I love this stuff</li>
<li> I love this moisturizer.  </li>
<li> I just love it.</li>
<li> A fantastic  product!</li>
<li> I sunburn in about 10 minutes, so I&#x27;ve tried many sunscreens.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years.</li>
<li> using it for years - love it.</li>
<li> There are definitely better moisturizers out on the market.</li>
<li> This is an okay moisturizer.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s lighter than most, but even my skin (which tends to be a bit drier) felt hydrated by this lotion.</li>
<li> As I see it, it will take many more laser treatments to, hopefully, undo the damage done by this product.  </li>
<li> and I&#x27;m satisfied now.</li>
<li> I have super-sensitive Irish skin - and this is the best non-greasy moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
<li> i love this face moisturizer.</li>
<li> its so light and has spf!</li>
<li> and I love it.</li>
<li> I love it :)</li>
<li> Always a favorite.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this product almost every day for two years, and I just love it.  </li>
<li> Have used for many years.  </li>
<li> Love it.</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t need a lotion AND a sunscreen now.</li>
<li> I consider this the best facial sunscreen and insist the children put it on after they brush their teeth in the morning.</li>
<li> Love this product.</li>
<li> It also has a nice light scent.</li>
<li> Love this product.</li>
<li> To make it more moisturizing, I put a bit of oil or glycerin and hyaluronic lotion with it.</li>
<li> This is the best daily moisturizer with 30 SPF I&#x27;ve found.</li>
<li> would love to love it, but</li>
<li> skin feels healthy with this.</li>
<li> Beiersdorf makes great products that are reasonable in cost, this is one of them.</li>
<li> Most good options that have 30 or more SPF are very pricey.</li>
<li> I have an oily skin and this lotion is perfect because absorbing so fast</li>
<li> so I can apply/reapply it more freely during the day.</li>
<li> It goes on light and does not look greasy or smell, as most sunscreen products do.</li>
<li> Does not irritate skin and offers great sun protection.</li>
<li> Okay, this lotion is fantastic for my face.</li>
<li> i love it that it&#x27;s cheap</li>
<li> :Good light weight,matte, non-comedogenic moisturizer suitable for sensitive and oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
<li> Great product at such a cheap price!</li>
<li> Nivea has a strong frangrance and feel it irritates my skin.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m happy to have broad spectrum SPF 30 protection that doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out.</li>
<li> This stuff is great so far - light, absorbs quickly, and I love that it&#x27;s got a halfway-decent SPF built in.</li>
<li> it is looks very natural and provides good protection from the sun.</li>
<li> Being a guy, I&#x27;m not used to putting on \\&quot;make-up\\&quot; daily, but this stuff is easy to apply, soaks in quickly, and more effective than even Bullfrog as a sunscreen!</li>
<li> It still seems great as a sunblock, and, so far, I haven&#x27;t noticed more frequent breakouts, but the lotion feels much more slimy to me than it used to.  </li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t noticed an increase in acne, which is amazing because I&#x27;m very prone to breakouts.</li>
<li> Great got facial sunblock</li>
<li> great all over facial moisturizer/sunscreen to use in addition to this</li>
<li> I put about two coats of this on my skin and it makes my skin silky smooth.</li>
<li> 10 minutes after putting it on, you don&#x27;t even realize its there because it&#x27;s light and nongreasy.</li>
<li> I  ordered 5 to get free shipping</li>
<li> Great product especially for the price.</li>
<li> The one I purchased was lightweight and it did go on smooth and it is light-weight as advertised.</li>
<li> 10 minutes after putting it on, you don&#x27;t even realize its there because it&#x27;s light and nongreasy.  </li>
<li> It is light and non-greasy.  </li>
<li> Great daily moisturizer!</li>
<li> Fantastic moisturizing lotion.</li>
<li> So this is a good option that works well even for sensitive skin.</li>
<li> So far so good in that I haven&#x27;t noticed any breakouts from it or irritation either.</li>
<li> cream goes in super easily.</li>
<li> I wear it each day under makeup and even with my fair skin in the strong Colorado sun, I don&#x27;t get sunburned--even if I&#x27;m outside for hours.  </li>
<li> Its ingredients are very safe for sensitive skin as well.</li>
<li> /&gt;It&#x27;s worth a shot in my opinion!</li>
<li> Feels great and lasts a long time.</li>
<li> I was given a small trial sample of Eucerin and it works wonderfully.  </li>
<li> It starts at lightweight and continues on to rich.</li>
<li> It leaves your skin soft, healthy, moisturized,not greasy and with a very light scent of sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been out in the sun a lot since I bought this product</li>
<li> A great moisturizer that really is for sensitive skin.  </li>
<li> She has been using this lotion for a long time and she has a very nice skin.</li>
<li> this is my second bottle from this amazing moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;it has SPF of 30 which is perfect for daily protection, fragrance free which is suitable for my sensitive skin and Parabens-free which is the first</li>
<li> And I notice that when I wear it under my mineral makeup, the makeup seems to cake in spots of my face unless I make a special effort to blot up</li>
<li> The product is excellent, hard to find in my area too.  </li>
<li> My dermatologist insists I protect my fair skin by using sunscreen on my face daily.  </li>
<li> Love the texture of this lotion, goes on very well, not greasy.  </li>
<li> Good for acne and doesn&#x27;t make your eyes burn like cetaphil spf facial moisturizer.</li>
<li> This product is nice for sensitive skin.</li>
<li> My skin is a nice tan and when I wear this on my face , it seems like I&#x27;m wearing two shades lighter than my natural color.</li>
<li> Not a bad moisturizer.  </li>
<li> but I gave this one a shot and have had no bad reaction to it.  </li>
<li> My dermatologist no longer recommends this product to his patients and I feel very strongly that it should be recalled by the FDA, as it poses a significant threat to the very persons who would be most inclined to use it, those of us with sensitive skin.</li>
<li> Though other people said the pump isn&#x27;t great and clogs, I never had that problem, the lotion comes out smoothly and easily, and I can put the right amount of pressure to get the right amount I want.</li>
<li> and i have a darker skin tone but other than that its great</li>
<li> I am a 37 year old female with very fair, Fitzgerald type</li>
<li> A great contributing product to help maintain and to protect the body&#x27;s (young or old) 24/7 moisturizing balancing act.</li>
<li> to get that high of an SPF, it uses oxides, you have to be sure and rub it in.</li>
<li> As this product was promoted by my dermatologist and also approved by the American Academy of Dermatologists, I assumed it was a good choice and safe for my sensitive skin.  </li>
<li> So far so good this facial moisturizer has been doing good things to my sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
<li> It really upset me !!  </li>
<li> I really like it!!</li>
<li> Love this moisterizer it makes my skin super soft</li>
<li> I have very sensitive skin and have been so happy that my dermatologist recommended Eucerin Daily Protection Moisturizing Face Lotion for my face.</li>
<li> Eucerin is very gentle, mild frangrance if any and absorbs quickly.  </li>
<li> Nice product for the price, although the zinc and titanium oxides in this product do leave the skin a little dry,&lt;br /&gt;it could use more vitamins/moisturizers.  </li>
<li> I often wear it without makeup, and in the past, it gave my skin a nice matte look that I liked very much.  </li>
<li> It goes on so light, and rubs in really well.</li>
<li> I have really sensitive skin and most lotions irritate my face</li>
<li> Good solid everyday protection at a good price.</li>
<li> Also not heavy at all :)</li>
<li> Plus it is economical.</li>
<li> It has to be diluted with oil in order for it to be absorbed by my skin...</li>
<li> Rub in an upwards circular motion and it will blend right in.</li>
<li> The price was just right</li>
<li> I have very sensitive skin that burns easily but tends to break out from the ingredients in SPF.</li>
<li> and I have been happy using it for the past couple of years.</li>
<li> I got this product from Walgreens and it serves all of my needs, it is fragrance free which is great because I don&#x27;t even realize I have it on during the day (unlike other spf facial products!).</li>
<li> but I can&#x27;t stop my pimples and acnes coming out more n more everyday .</li>
<li> its not very moisturizing so you might want to get a light lotion and apply this on top for sun protection</li>
<li> This works really nicely without leaving me too dry or too greasy.</li>
<li> This beats the higher priced sunscreens.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and I used to LOVE it, but now, I&#x27;d have to say I only \\&quot;like\\&quot; it.  </li>
<li> The latest bottle I bought seems to feel like a slightly different product.  </li>
<li> Yes, it does leave a white film, but I found that it soaks in when you use it on top of another moisturizer.  </li>
<li> After applying the first time, I had to wash my face immediately.  </li>
<li> Really!?)</li>
<li> I wanted to like this so much!</li>
<li> In the summer I do add a higher level of sun protection.</li>
<li> I can definitely feel it when I touch my face, but it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy like most sunscreen - it just feels like the lotion never quite finished</li>
<li> I went back to my favorite QV.</li>
<li> It is a light weight moisturizer w/ SPF for sensitive skin in summer, but in winter, I would use a heavier or thicker moisturizer.</li>
<li> I wish the SPF was higher--</li>
<li> search for a facial moisturizer with SPF has come to an end with this product :)</li>
<li> However, if I sweat in the first hour or so after putting it on, I will look like I&#x27;m sweating milk.</li>
<li> I use it daily and have ordered it more than once from Amazon.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried many face lotions and I keep coming back to this one for daytime use.  </li>
<li> It sinks in nicely on my skin without any whiteish cast.</li>
<li> Wish it came in a higher SPF version.</li>
<li> Before that I was using Neutrogena Ultra Sheer, and this is better than that because it&#x27;s not as shiny, and never stings.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very convenient !</li>
<li> I just tried this for the first time this week.</li>
<li> Love the automatic daily face sun protection.  </li>
<li> Even for fair skinned person white film is obvious and in no way you can use and not look a bit like a ghost.</li>
<li> Because my skin is so dry, the next bottle I purchase will be more on the rich side because it absorbs quickly.</li>
<li> Its kind of oily and has a sun screen smell but should keep normal to dry skin moisturized.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this pretty much every day for about 3 years.</li>
<li> i am 54 and sensitive to sunscreens but this one is light and does the work with a high spf.</li>
<li> and I use a prescription cleanser for mild and sporadic adult acne.</li>
<li> I was trying to get one that didn&#x27;t have such a strong sunscreen smell</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very light, it absorbs easily, and I have neither broken out or burned once since using it, even on vacation under the hot Florida sun!</li>
<li> Adds sufficient moisture for large % of my skin.</li>
<li> It leaves a white residue but it gets absorbed quickly.</li>
<li> and that is really saying something.</li>
<li> /&gt;-It&#x27;s REALLY oily.</li>
<li> maybe I really can&#x27;t use zinc oxide sunscreen on my face</li>
<li> Would highly recommend!</li>
<li> Despite this, I still really like this lotion.</li>
<li> it does leave a while film but just rub it in real well</li>
<li> The lotion is watery and it doesn&#x27;t really absorb into your skin.</li>
<li> Highly recommend!</li>
<li> and I can really tell the difference.  </li>
<li> Not yet used, but very like this brand</li>
<li> and it didn&#x27;t even really moisturize my face but latched onto the oily areas of my face (like my nose)</li>
<li> Moisturizing works well and its not irritating</li>
<li> It was recommended by my dermatologist and is much cheaper here than in a drug store.</li>
<li> I also found it didn&#x27;t moisturize very well for me.</li>
<li> Too greasy on face, and it leaves white streaks on face if you don&#x27;t make sure you&#x27;ve COMPLETELY rubbed in every bit.</li>
<li> Use a lighter more natural face lotion with spf 15 all over face and then apply this only to parts of your face that stick</li>
<li> It&#x27;s nice for my skin, Thin and light cream, I will buy it again.</li>
<li> Much to my surprise,  upon application the product quickly absorbed into my skin and it was not messy or greasy at all.</li>
<li> But I am aware how important it is to protect the collagen in your skin from breaking down, especially in my twenties, to preserve healthy skin for the coming years.</li>
<li> I have very sensitive skin, the good news is that this didn&#x27;t break me out or cause a weird rash, however I normally wear Vanicream which I love if I could get the lite lotion with an spf</li>
<li> Quite frankly, I was not wild about using a moisturizer but the sun screen additive was fine.</li>
<li> I have medium skin ( not dry and not oily, I&#x27;m lucky</li>
<li> After spending hundreds if not thousands of dollars on drug store, department store and special order products I finally gave Eucerin a try - IT</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not too thick, it&#x27;s light and easy to apply.</li>
<li> Paste and relaxed, not greasy, everyday can also prevent bask in effect, is suitable for the face</li>
<li> Good, the only reason it&#x27;s not a 5 is because it is sorta oily when you put it on, but it takes a little while to absorb.</li>
<li> She said similar things about being able to get by with only one squirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I guess its decent.</li>
<li> After receiving V beam laser treatment for mild rosacea, I was advised by my dermatologist to wear sunblock on a regular basis.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this particular face lotion when I started to try and make all the products I use, not so chemically, plus it&#x27;s recommended by the cancer society...</li>
<li> Aveeno burned my face, and I thought it was from the high SPF, but it must be from another ingredient, because I don&#x27;t have that problem with this one.</li>
<li> If u r trying out products this will be the one to try before going high brands</li>
<li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
<li> My dermatologist highly recommends it.</li>
<li> In certain lights you can clearly see where I have applied the product on my face.  </li>
<li> I can&#x27;t emphasize enough how gentle this sunscreen is!!  </li>
<li> Like most face lotions with SPF, it takes a little longer to rub in with the added benefit of sunscreen.</li>
<li> to make it even better, a little of this product goes a longggg way.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s too rich for my combination skin, but works well for my tween daughter&#x27;s dry skin.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m normally allergic to the SPF creams</li>
<li> As someone with super sensitive skin and rosacea, I am constantly on the prowl for a moisturizer with sunscreen that won&#x27;t aggravate my skin.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t have any antioxidants or other skin-improving additions (though the sunscreen is important), so I wear an antioxidant serum underneath.</li>
<li> I was wondering why I began to get new breakouts.</li>
<li> I went back and forth trying cleansers/ moisturizers for oily skin in an attempt to clear up the acne and cleansers/moisturizers for dry skin in an attempt to hydrate - nothing worked and most products</li>
<li> Tried to make the most of it by using it as body sunscreen for the beach, but it became runny white streaks when I got wet.</li>
<li> Not as lightweight as package information indicates, but still feels more lightweight than other similar products.</li>
<li> I have zero irritation after putting it on, even around my sensitive eyes!  </li>
<li> but it does leave a white residue probably more due to the sun block in it.</li>
<li> that&#x27;s because one full pump dispenses too much; only use about a half a pump on freshly washed skin</li>
<li> , NOT THAT HEAVY, I LIKE IT, AND IT IS NOT SO STICKY, ABSORB EASILY.</li>
<li> Although other reviewers were ok on this apparently i am not the one.</li>
<li> I have been using this product for a few years and is working out just fine.  </li>
<li> But I guess it only works for certain people.</li>
<li> BUT, it&#x27;s very hard to find a daily lightweight moisturizer that goes on so smoothly, is fragrance free, has an SPF of 30 and doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune -</li>
<li> I do notice that it makes my face look a little more pinkish (even though the product is white)</li>
<li> These should have been mentioned online and clearly on the packaging.  </li>
<li> People guess I&#x27;m in my early 20s.</li>
<li> I have sensitive skin and used this all over my face</li>
<li> I am an adult</li>
<li> This is a light-weight moisturizer that works well on my sensitive skin.  </li>
<li> It feels like there is no heavy sunscreen,</li>
<li> I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use the products that use chemical sunscreens - this uses minerals like zinc to block the rays.</li>
<li> Instead of moisturizing it like it claims to do, it did the complete opposite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I sensitive skin.  </li>
<li> My frequent use as the doctors tells me.</li>
<li> I have sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
<li> I really like this lotion but the only downside is that my hands get sticky after applying it and cannot do it on the run.</li>
<li> It irritates my eyes even though I don&#x27;t put it near the sensitive eye area.</li>
<li> Also, it starts to flake off with my foundation near the end of the night.</li>
<li> There&#x27;s no offensive SPF smell, and I can&#x27;t get over how soft my face feels.</li>
<li> Recommended for a sensitive skin.</li>
<li> So far my fav day to day moisturizer.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now (not as consistently as I should, but fairly consistently) and have yet to run out.</li>
<li> When I first put it on, I noticed the smell, exactly like sunscreen, and my face (which is already pale) looked like a ghost.</li>
<li> On pale skin like mine, though, it doesn&#x27;t look white, it just makes my skin look better:</li>
<li> Easy to use, no big mess.  </li>
<li> Left white streaks on my face, which is slightly tan.&lt;br /&gt;Feels more like a sunscreen than a moisturizer</li>
<li> main downside to this moisturizer is that it stays a bit white on your skin.</li>
<li> I use just a little while my skin is still damp and it absorbs quickly; there is no greasy feel.</li>
<li> In the new product description, only mineral sunscreens Titanium Dioxide and Zinc Oxide are mentioned.  </li>
<li> Not greasy at all and very moisturizing to my dry skin.</li>
<li> Works really well and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face.</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t get enough of it, my wife uses it daily and absolutely loves it...</li>
<li> I wear it daily and haven&#x27;t had a problem even though I have very sensitive skin.</li>
<li> Better than the most expensive products I have bought in the past, cannot compare to this Eucerin moisturizer/protect</li>
<li> Caused major break out after 2 days of use.</li>
<li> It also has broad spectrum SPF 30 sun protection in it.</li>
<li> I recommend this highly for anyone looking for a daily sunscreen that&#x27;s not oily/heavy and actually works (imagine that!).</li>
<li> Pretty disappointing for many reasons.</li>
<li> I have tried the intense repair body lotion from Eucarin and it was way too heavy and left a greasy film on my skin, as well as breakouts in unusual places (a pimple on my KNEE?</li>
<li> Eucerin Sensitive Facial  </li>
<li> so I need just one small squirt to cover my face and neck, making the bottle last a long time which saves money :)</li>
<li> Was surprised that it didn&#x27;t make my combination skin oily, especially in the t-zone - but after reading the reviews I decided to try it.  </li>
<li> This is the only non-greasy sunscreen/moisturizer I&#x27;ve found that never stings on my sensitive skin, even on a cut that&#x27;s just been washed, or on sunburned skin.</li>
<li> some &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; products use mineral sunscreens, too, like Lush&#x27;s &#x27;Feel Younger Skin Tint&#x27; and Skin79</li>
<li> I experimented with using less, massaging the lotion in more, apply while my face is still a little damp, and nothing seems to work.</li>
<li> I wanted a daily facial sunscreen with only mineral sunscreens, because many chemical sunscreens have been shown to negatively impact health and disrupt hormones.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but I will only use this sunblock on my face, since it never makes me feel sticky and gross.</li>
<li> Thin, More like a lotion then a daily cream.</li>
<li> It has a great consistency, not too thin and not too thick, so it keeps my skin moist.</li>
<li> and I still have to work a little too hard to make sure that this product has completely disolved into my skin.  </li>
<li> Also there is no strange smell.</li>
<li> I have sensitive and dry skin.</li>
<li> Tbh, I used this as Youtuber frmheadtotoe raved about how it worked for her sensitive and dry skin.</li>
<li> If you are sensitive to sulfates in the smallest way, this product will definitely dry out your skin.</li>
<li> i am 33years old dry</li>
<li> /&gt;i gave this to my 63years old mother in law with dry skin and she loves it.</li>
<li> After three months of using this product on a daily basis, my eyes became extremely sensitive due to the fumes emitted when I applied the product to my face and I developed conjunctivitis twice in one month; (the ophthalmologist who treated me assured me that the conjunctivitis was chemically induced and I had no reason to doubt him as I have no prior history of eye problems).  </li>
<li> I live in a tropical climate, and it has saved me a few times when I am out in the sun unexpectedly.</li>
<li> I have tried Neutrogena, Olay and Aveeno products, and the first two were very heavy and greasy and caused breakouts almost immediately.</li>
<li> I bought this as a replacement for the same brand&#x27;s now discontinued daily moisturizing lotion SPF 30 (in the white and pink bottle), thinking that this product would be essentially the same.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m definitely buying this again, but I think its gonna last really long.</li>
<li> This moisturizer works very well for my Asian skin - it is one of very few that don&#x27;t cause my skin to break out.</li>
<li> Love this stuff, not oily or greasy and even my wife ended up using it in Hawaii because her expensive stuff was not really offering any protection despite being the same SPF.</li>
<li> After nearly a month of use, I stopped using it and the breakouts calmed down.</li>
<li> It will definitely last you a long time!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not too oily, but it moisturizes well enough for dry skin.</li>
<li> I had several dry patches on my neck after using it.</li>
<li> I have been using it every single day for the last 10 years</li>
<li> which means it&#x27;ll probably be a long time before I&#x27;ll use up this bottle.  </li>
<li> so I use this selectively and usually only apply this to my forehead, cheek apples, nose, ears, tip of chin and center of decollete.</li>
<li> It protects and leaves my skin moisturized for long periods of time and is not greasy.  </li>
<li> but so far I haven&#x27;t had to much trouble with oil control.</li>
<li> Long time user.  </li>
<li> downside you may find is that the Zinc Oxide and Titanium Dioxide make it a little bit more difficult to get the lotion to soak in and disappear.</li>
<li> The only possible negative so far is, because its made with titanium dioxide, it tends to leave little white streaks if you sweat or go out in the rain.</li>
<li> and it gave me a dry rash under one of my eyes.</li>
<li> does slightly dry out my skin</li>
<li> BUT it leaves my skin extremely dry and parched.</li>
<li> I tried this lotion and started having flaky, dry skin immediately.</li>
<li> For years I had dry skin combined with acne.  </li>
<li> Also, your skin needs to be really, really dry when you apply it</li>
<li> If you have brown to dark skin this product will leave your face with a white residue.</li>
<li> I had previously been using a different one but wanted one with SPF</li>
<li> I have very dry skin</li>
<li> In the past, with daily use, I used about one bottle every 9 months to a year, but I&#x27;m now applying about half as much lotion as I did in the past.</li>
<li> I was a little freaked out about skin cancer afterwards and decided I should start using some sun protection for my face to prevent it as much as possible.</li>
<li> or it leaves a little bit of a white ish tinge on your skin</li>
<li> I was hoping to use this as a daily moisturizer, but it is a little bit too greasy for my oily skin</li>
<li> I obviously don&#x27;t put it in my eye but if a little gets in, I have to wash my eyes out because of the burning.</li>
<li> This did the job of moisturizing, but it left a white wash across my face no matter how hard I tried to blend it into my skin.  </li>
<li> I even gave it a second chance, and both times it made me break out all over my face and neck after a few days.</li>
<li> This leaves a heavy white residue.</li>
<li> I have a hard time with moisturizer due to sensitive and acne prone oily skin.</li>
<li> The only problem is that it&#x27;s not very moisturizing, so I have to use a moisturizer under it, and then add a thin layer of this to my face for extra moisture plus SPF.  </li>
<li> I bought this product because I need fragrance free/odorless due to allergies and asthma.  </li>
<li> I generally do pretty well with Eucerin products, but unfortunately, this just wasn&#x27;t it.</li>
<li> I am on my 3rd bottle, that says a lot as I am usually always changing products.</li>
<li> Did not irritate like other SPFs.</li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;Almost no scent except &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; scent you&#x27;d recognize from other zinc-oxide products.</li>
<li> I love this brand, but was disappointed with this product.</li>
<li> She recommended using a product with zinc as an active ingredient.</li>
<li> The only thing is for now, while it&#x27;s cold out, I have to apply some of my regular moisturizer underneath because my skin is extra dry.</li>
<li> A little little bit goes a long way.</li>
<li> This product does not work well for dark African-American skin.</li>
<li> It is entirely too thick.</li>
<li> Cuts down on the products in my drawer.</li>
<li> I put it on my face (from below my eyes down), ears, neck and arms.</li>
<li> Usually my skin gets really dry after being in the sun.</li>
<li> only little complaint is that it needs to be rubbed in reallt well</li>
<li> I am also using much less</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not greasy but does leave skin slightly ghostly.</li>
<li> but this isn&#x27;t noticeable after a little while.</li>
<li> Even then, my skin would still be a little flaky from the dryness</li>
<li> It is a little greasy under makeup</li>
<li> only made things worse.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s not too heavy but does moisturize.</li>
<li> I have acne prone skin and noticed after about 5 hours it starts to feel oily and heavy on my skin.</li>
<li> It totally dried my skin out.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a few years now.  </li>
<li> II don&#x27;t use chemical sunscreens as I can taste them a few minutes after I apply them.</li>
<li> I use this everyday.</li>
<li> It does go on somewhat &amp;#34; white&amp;#34;, so I mix a it with a few drops of tinted moisturizer (I use Balm Shelter) and</li>
<li> Do NOT buy if you are even slightly tanned!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m already pale, but this is like...</li>
<li> I put BB cream over it, but then the consistency of this is like sunscreen that does not easily fade into the skin so it did not work with my BB cream, either.&lt;br /&gt;Probably would not buy again.</li>
<li> It goes on a little thick, leaving a thin layer of white lotion, but after a minute or two it goes away.</li>
<li> a little on the thick side ....</li>
<li> If you put it on a little too thick you&#x27;ll have to work rub it in.</li>
<li> /&gt;Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;You need very little to cover your face</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a firm believer in having some protection every day!</li>
<li> Researchers shown that even small amounts of sun exposure every day cumulatively leads to accelerated aging of the skin.</li>
<li> I stopped using it because I was unable to find it locally and bought Nivea&#x27;s Q10 lotion</li>
<li> Whenever I use it, I find it difficult to rub in the white cream.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately for me I found it to leave a sort of white mask over my face.</li>
<li> Just a small amount works for me.</li>
<li> I have very pale skin and have tried many moisturizers; this is one of the worst.</li>
<li> I am in my late sixties</li>
<li> A total disappointment....</li>
<li> Gives you the SPF coverage without being thick.</li>
<li> it is too thick</li>
<li> (it&#x27;s a very small drawer.)</li>
<li> Stupidly, I persisted in using this product and have since developed a horrible rash across my entire face complete with broken capillaries and patches of melasma,</li>
<li> It soaks in fairly quickly and isn&#x27;t terribly shiny.</li>
<li> Really not suitable for what I hv combination to oily skin !</li>
<li> It can be hard to find in stores, so I recommend stocking up on Amazon when you find it!</li>
<li> I was really disappointed and only used it once since then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> However, my skin--which has never been sensitive--has broken into a rash because of this.</li>
<li> Has SPF 30 Just hate the white residue it leaves on your face.</li>
<li> The thin consistancy of the product makes it</li>
<li> It&#x27;s like a sunscreen scent but very very subtle.</li>
<li> I guess I looked like a dead or sickly person after applying this and</li>
<li> it is very bad ,and very dry.</li>
<li> but unfortunately this one does.</li>
<li> Instead, I am now stuck with an expensive bottle of useless lotion.</li>
<li> :Doesn&#x27;t rub in well, leaves horrible white spots and streaks.</li>
<li> biggest disappointment from this product was one of its ingredients: sulfate.</li>
<li> /&gt;Overall, this was disappointing.</li>
<li> It did not turn out too bad.  </li>
<li> I have nothing bad to say about this product.</li>
<li> Not as bad as I was thinking.</li>
<li> , I was shocked when I looked into the mirror.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m disappointed in this product.</li>
<li> but I guess I can&#x27;t :(</li>
<li> I looked like a ghost! :(</li>
<li> It&#x27;s really a horrible product, in my opinion.</li>
<li> terrible service</li>
<li> The worst moisturizer ever!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t make me break out and that is really saying something. It soaks in fairly quickly and isn&#x27;t terribly shiny. I dust it with face powder. If I try to put foundation on top of it, it does make me break out. Sigh.</li>
    <li> Works well and my skin does feel moisturized. I just don&#x27;t like how it smells like sunscreen though. I was trying to get one that didn&#x27;t have such a strong sunscreen smell but unfortunately this one does.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. I have been using it every single day for the last 10 years and i&#x27;m in my not-so-early 30s. I have medium skin ( not dry and not oily, I&#x27;m lucky I guess). It leaves a white residue but it gets absorbed quickly. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of this lotion but my skin looks young and has no visible sun damage and minimal amount of wrinkles. People guess I&#x27;m in my early 20s. So yes ladies start using sunscreen waaaay before wrinkles are supposed to start showing up and use it religiously.</li>
    <li> I have used this product daily for over 10 years, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with its effectiveness as a moisturizer and as daily sun protection. I have very fair skin, so I never leave the house without some SPF. This product is great for oily and sensitive skin as well - it goes on light and is great under makeup, and doesn&#x27;t make my face more oily or cause breakouts. It can be hard to find in stores, so I recommend stocking up on Amazon when you find it!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Great sun protection at a low price.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Appears to agree with my acne-prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Can leave a white cast on your face. Even after blending foundation over it, sometimes the white residue is still visible and, if you rub your face against something, it can even flake.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive and dry skin. I guess the sunscreen wasn&#x27;t good for my sensitivity. Also, it gave a greasy feeling. I was wondering why I began to get new breakouts. After nearly a month of use, I stopped using it and the breakouts calmed down. Tbh, I used this as Youtuber frmheadtotoe raved about how it worked for her sensitive and dry skin. But I guess it only works for certain people. If you have tried this and it didn&#x27;t work out, try using Kiss My Face&#x27;s Under Age Moisturizer. It&#x27;s not too oily, but it moisturizes well enough for dry skin. Its ingredients are very safe for sensitive skin as well.</li>
    <li> takes a second to blend in, otherwise, perfect.</li>
    <li> The product is excellent, hard to find in my area too.  Can&#x27;t get enough of it, my wife uses it daily and absolutely loves it...</li>
    <li> A great price for a good sunscreen.  Product was well packaged and arrived on time.  This beats the higher priced sunscreens.</li>
    <li> Too greasy on face, and it leaves white streaks on face if you don&#x27;t make sure you&#x27;ve COMPLETELY rubbed in every bit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and I used to LOVE it, but now, I&#x27;d have to say I only \\&quot;like\\&quot; it.  The latest bottle I bought seems to feel like a slightly different product.  It still seems great as a sunblock, and, so far, I haven&#x27;t noticed more frequent breakouts, but the lotion feels much more slimy to me than it used to.  I often wear it without makeup, and in the past, it gave my skin a nice matte look that I liked very much.  The latest bottle makes my skin look way too shiny!  And I notice that when I wear it under my mineral makeup, the makeup seems to cake in spots of my face unless I make a special effort to blot up any extra lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I imagine I&#x27;ll continue to use this product, but I don&#x27;t plan to recommend it to my friends the way I used to.  I am also using much less which means it&#x27;ll probably be a long time before I&#x27;ll use up this bottle.  In the past, with daily use, I used about one bottle every 9 months to a year, but I&#x27;m now applying about half as much lotion as I did in the past.</li>
    <li> I bought this moisturizer because I was looking for something with the proper SPF for my face.  This one is perfect.  The only problem is that it&#x27;s not very moisturizing, so I have to use a moisturizer under it, and then add a thin layer of this to my face for extra moisture plus SPF.  Yes, it does leave a white film, but I found that it soaks in when you use it on top of another moisturizer.  I can wear it without makeup and you can&#x27;t tell, but makeup also covers it well.  Compared to the Aveeno with SPF 30, I like this one a lot better.  Aveeno burned my face, and I thought it was from the high SPF, but it must be from another ingredient, because I don&#x27;t have that problem with this one.</li>
    <li> I bought this moisturizer because it was on a list of &amp;#34;best for oily skin types&amp;#34;. I was really disappointed and only used it once since then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s REALLY oily. I would NOT recommend this for anyone with combination or oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t absorb well. I can still feel it sitting on my face like an hour after I&#x27;ve used in.&lt;br /&gt;-It turns your face into this white-ish hue. I&#x27;m already pale, but this is like... I don&#x27;t know, I was shocked when I looked into the mirror. I guess I looked like a dead or sickly person after applying this and it kind of made me creeped out.&lt;br /&gt;-The spf smell is strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would just use this as a sunscreen. And maybe not even, because it just stays on top of your skin. It&#x27;s really a horrible product, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This is a great cream. I&#x27;m in PA school and we had a dermatologist come in to teach our dermatology section. I was a little freaked out about skin cancer afterwards and decided I should start using some sun protection for my face to prevent it as much as possible. She recommended using a product with zinc as an active ingredient. This cream contains zinc so I decided to give it a try. [This is not medical advice. I just wanted to provide some background as part of my review]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream goes in super easily. I haven&#x27;t noticed an increase in acne, which is amazing because I&#x27;m very prone to breakouts. Best of all, one squirt gets my entire face covered. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now (not as consistently as I should, but fairly consistently) and have yet to run out. It will definitely last you a long time! I recommended it to my mom and she seems to be enjoying it as well. She said similar things about being able to get by with only one squirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth a shot in my opinion!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I need fragrance free/odorless due to allergies and asthma.  After applying the first time, I had to wash my face immediately.  Smelled just like sunscreen and made my eyes itch.  I returned it to the store for a refund.  I do not recommend if you are looking for ODORLESS sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Great got facial sunblock</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for over a year. I love it.</li>
    <li> I guess its decent. Its kind of oily and has a sun screen smell but should keep normal to dry skin moisturized.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin that burns easily but tends to break out from the ingredients in SPF. But I am aware how important it is to protect the collagen in your skin from breaking down, especially in my twenties, to preserve healthy skin for the coming years. I have tried Neutrogena, Olay and Aveeno products, and the first two were very heavy and greasy and caused breakouts almost immediately. Aveeno was okay, but it didn&#x27;t protect as well. I checked reviews on Amazon for a different lotion and hesitantly tried this one. I have tried the intense repair body lotion from Eucarin and it was way too heavy and left a greasy film on my skin, as well as breakouts in unusual places (a pimple on my KNEE? Really!?) BUT I tried this anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This face lotion RULES. It&#x27;s very light, it absorbs easily, and I have neither broken out or burned once since using it, even on vacation under the hot Florida sun! I&#x27;ve read a lot of complaints about it leaving streaks- that&#x27;s because one full pump dispenses too much; only use about a half a pump on freshly washed skin that&#x27;s still a bit damp. Rub in an upwards circular motion and it will blend right in. Otherwise my only warning is that it isn&#x27;t totally water or sweat proof. My boyfriend and I go running every day and it was in my eyes after a while. This is perfect for daily wear, but for the beach or an outdoor workout, aim for something waterproof.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and used this all over my face and it gave me a dry rash under one of my eyes. So don&#x27;t use this around the eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does slightly dry out my skin so I use this selectively and usually only apply this to my forehead, cheek apples, nose, ears, tip of chin and center of decollete. I can&#x27;t use it all over since it dries out my cheeks, sides of chin, neck and eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO TO SUMMARIZE: Use a lighter more natural face lotion with spf 15 all over face and then apply this only to parts of your face that stick out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great all over facial moisturizer/sunscreen to use in addition to this is Yes To Carrots moisturizer/spf15</li>
    <li> I like it and use it every day. Great price too.</li>
    <li> Bought this because it was recommended by an online beauty expert (&amp;#34;Hot &amp; Flashy - love her videos). I have liked everything she has ever recommended, except this. Leaves such a whitish, ghostly finish - I only use it if I am going to be gardening, or running, and don&#x27;t care about make-up.</li>
    <li> Not greasy at all and very moisturizing to my dry skin. Feels great and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I was Hesitating because wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;m going to like it. I have a hard time with moisturizer due to sensitive and acne prone oily skin. It did not turn out too bad.  I think I can make it work since I needoisturizer and SPF or retinol use daily at nite. It&#x27;s good product.  If u r trying out products this will be the one to try before going high brands</li>
    <li> Though it has sunscreen, it still feels mostly like a moisturizer. It can sting though if it gets in your eyes. Most good options that have 30 or more SPF are very pricey. So this is a good option that works well even for sensitive skin. Once blended it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel.</li>
    <li> Truthfully, I don&#x27;t like the name.  It sounds so medicinal.  BUT, it&#x27;s very hard to find a daily lightweight moisturizer that goes on so smoothly, is fragrance free, has an SPF of 30 and doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune - so I am a very satisfied customer despite the name.</li>
    <li> I have not uesed it yet, looks good.</li>
    <li> Love it! Feels great on my face!</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin and most lotions irritate my face so I often go without.  I was given a small trial sample of Eucerin and it works wonderfully.  My skin looks better, the lotion doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and best of all it does not irritate my skin!</li>
    <li> I am an adult and I use a prescription cleanser for mild and sporadic adult acne. The prescription works wonders BUT it leaves my skin extremely dry and parched. This Eucerin cream works wonders to moisturize my skin and helps me not feel like a lizard woman after my daily washing in the shower. &lt;br /&gt;Try it. It works...</li>
    <li> The product is perfect and excellent i love it and i use al the morning, my complains is i ordered in june 2 and they change me the delivery twice and no one let me know if are going to send me the item. terrible service</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, absorbs in a reasonable time, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy look or feel - good product at a good price.</li>
    <li> Really not suitable for what I hv combination to oily skin ! I hv been used for 2 weeks after I received it but I can&#x27;t stop my pimples and acnes coming out more n more everyday . It really upset me !!  maybe I really can&#x27;t use zinc oxide sunscreen on my face even I realise it is safe.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist insists I protect my fair skin by using sunscreen on my face daily.  Most are oily and can damage contact lenses if it gets in your eyes.  I tried several \\&quot;beauty\\&quot; lotions with sunscreen in them, and Eucerin was the best.  Being a guy, I&#x27;m not used to putting on \\&quot;make-up\\&quot; daily, but this stuff is easy to apply, soaks in quickly, and more effective than even Bullfrog as a sunscreen!</li>
    <li> a little on the thick side ....</li>
    <li> it is light weight and effective no order and nice finish</li>
    <li> Best product ever. Have been using this for three years and no greasy feel. The Best moisturizer and sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever had. Better than the most expensive products I have bought in the past, cannot compare to this Eucerin moisturizer/protect</li>
    <li> This is a light-weight moisturizer that works well on my sensitive skin.  I started using it after I found it on the Skin Cancer Foundation&#x27;s approved sunscreen list and haven&#x27;t stopped using it since.</li>
    <li> A good, clean-feeling moisturizer for problematic skin. I use just a little while my skin is still damp and it absorbs quickly; there is no greasy feel. After about a week I noticed a definite improvement. My skin looks and feels smoother and fresher, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with breakouts.</li>
    <li> Nice product for the price, although the zinc and titanium oxides in this product do leave the skin a little dry,&lt;br /&gt;it could use more vitamins/moisturizers.  If you have oily skin, I think it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem.  It is a good&lt;br /&gt;for daily sun protection, as it has SPF 30.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer works wonders for my skin for when I need to go out into the sun. Usually my skin gets really dry after being in the sun. I put about two coats of this on my skin and it makes my skin silky smooth. I love this stuff</li>
    <li> I have been on a hunt for a moisturizer with sunscreen that did not smell or feel like I put the sunscreen for the beach on my face.  This product is it!  I love this moisturizer.  It feels like there is no heavy sunscreen, and yet it&#x27;s SPF 30!  And for under $6, it&#x27;s a steal.</li>
    <li> This moisturizing lotion works well.  It protects and leaves my skin moisturized for long periods of time and is not greasy.  I use it under makeup.  I have tried many moisturizing, sun protecting lotions and this seems to be a really good value for its performance.</li>
    <li> great price, great stuff. i am 54 and sensitive to sunscreens but this one is light and does the work with a high spf.</li>
    <li> Not as lightweight as package information indicates, but still feels more lightweight than other similar products. It&#x27;s too rich for my combination skin, but works well for my tween daughter&#x27;s dry skin.</li>
    <li> Just what was needed..hard to find locally.</li>
    <li> Love the texture of this lotion, goes on very well, not greasy.  Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t emphasize enough how gentle this sunscreen is!!  I have zero irritation after putting it on, even around my sensitive eyes!  It&#x27;s just awesome! The only thing is for now, while it&#x27;s cold out, I have to apply some of my regular moisturizer underneath because my skin is extra dry. I also have a low thyroid, so maybe it&#x27;s just me.  I will buy this over n over again!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best sun screens I have ever used. I just love it. 10 minutes after putting it on, you don&#x27;t even realize its there because it&#x27;s light and nongreasy.</li>
    <li> nice and light, makes my skin feel great</li>
    <li> Paste and relaxed, not greasy, everyday can also prevent bask in effect, is suitable for the face</li>
    <li> Love this moisterizer it makes my skin super soft and i like that it has spf&lt;br /&gt;My only little complaint is that it needs to be rubbed in reallt well or it leaves a little bit of a white ish tinge on your skin (that&#x27;s probably because of the spf) and i have a darker skin tone but other than that its great</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this so much! However, my skin--which has never been sensitive--has broken into a rash because of this. I even gave it a second chance, and both times it made me break out all over my face and neck after a few days.</li>
    <li> It feels okay on the skin and probably does a good job against the sun but it contains dimethicone.  This is a silicone put in almost every skin and hair product on the market.  It builds up and actually dries our your skin.  I&#x27;ll look for something different next time</li>
    <li> This is the perfect light non-greasy moisturizer. It&#x27;s fast-absorbing and does not irritate my skin!  I put this on in the morning and again at night. The only moisturizer I&#x27;ll use.</li>
    <li> I had been using Eucerin Skin Renewal Lotion for about 3 years when&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it suddenly became unavailable. I tried this lotion and started having flaky, dry skin immediately.</li>
    <li> Eucerin makes great products. Eucerin Sensitive Facial  Skin Moisture Lotion comes in a spray bottle. It stops itchy skin problems instantly.   I was so happy I ordered two more bottles! A fantastic  product!</li>
    <li> Good solid everyday protection at a good price. I do notice that it makes my face look a little more pinkish (even though the product is white) but this isn&#x27;t noticeable after a little while. A good layer to use under make up, even if yours already has an SPF.</li>
    <li> I sunburn in about 10 minutes, so I&#x27;ve tried many sunscreens.  This is my favorite kind.  It doesn&#x27;t have a scent (or a chemical smell of itself either), it rubs in and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky oily film on my skin, and it keeps me from burning.  I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore, so I ordered it here.  I hope they don&#x27;t stop making it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years. It is the best combination of moisturizer and sunscreen for day use that I have found. I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use the products that use chemical sunscreens - this uses minerals like zinc to block the rays. No skin irritation. In the summer I do add a higher level of sun protection. Like all products that use the blocking method, you will want to wash your face daily to prevent buildup of the product.</li>
    <li> this is my second bottle from this amazing moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;it has SPF of 30 which is perfect for daily protection, fragrance free which is suitable for my sensitive skin and Parabens-free which is the first think i look for before buying anything.</li>
    <li> For years I had dry skin combined with acne.  I went back and forth trying cleansers/ moisturizers for oily skin in an attempt to clear up the acne and cleansers/moisturizers for dry skin in an attempt to hydrate - nothing worked and most products only made things worse.  After spending hundreds if not thousands of dollars on drug store, department store and special order products I finally gave Eucerin a try - IT WORKED!!!!  My skin is now acne free, moisturized and healthy!  Plus, Eucerin&#x27;s parent company, Beiersdorf (also the parent company for Nivea) does not test on animals.</li>
    <li> using it for years - love it.</li>
    <li> I generally do pretty well with Eucerin products, but unfortunately, this just wasn&#x27;t it. When I first put it on, I noticed the smell, exactly like sunscreen, and my face (which is already pale) looked like a ghost. It turned my skin white! And I reeked of sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest disappointment from this product was one of its ingredients: sulfate. If you are sensitive to sulfates in the smallest way, this product will definitely dry out your skin. My skin started flaking off after two weeks of using this lotion, and definitely improved when I stopped. Instead of moisturizing it like it claims to do, it did the complete opposite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this was disappointing. My skin looked flaky, white, and smelled like sunscreen. There are definitely better moisturizers out on the market.</li>
    <li> Eucerin is a well known quality brand. I don&#x27;t think the science is here today for a zinc based or paste-type sunscreen formula that isn&#x27;t chalky, pasty or sticky. This comes close to minimizing these undesirable effects, but I guess it is needed to make the product effective. I like it and will continue to use it. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Best face cream since Dove discontinued theirs. Gives you the SPF coverage without being thick.</li>
    <li> This is an okay moisturizer. It&#x27;s not too heavy but does moisturize. I have acne prone skin and noticed after about 5 hours it starts to feel oily and heavy on my skin. Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> Good for acne and doesn&#x27;t make your eyes burn like cetaphil spf facial moisturizer. Downside is that it does leave your face with an oily shine, it smells like sunblock, and it will leave your face white if you have a tanned skin complexion like mine</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice for my skin, Thin and light cream, I will buy it again. loving it!</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen. Rubs in well and is non-greasy.</li>
    <li> A great moisturizer that really is for sensitive skin.  It absorbs well and leave my skin feeling hydrated. Makeup go on nicely over it as well.</li>
    <li> As someone with super sensitive skin and rosacea, I am constantly on the prowl for a moisturizer with sunscreen that won&#x27;t aggravate my skin. I think I may have found my perfect \\&quot;stuff\\&quot;! It&#x27;s lighter than most, but even my skin (which tends to be a bit drier) felt hydrated by this lotion. The only possible negative so far is, because its made with titanium dioxide, it tends to leave little white streaks if you sweat or go out in the rain. But a simple blot takes care of it!</li>
    <li> I am a 37 year old female with very fair, Fitzgerald type I sensitive skin.  After receiving V beam laser treatment for mild rosacea, I was advised by my dermatologist to wear sunblock on a regular basis.  As this product was promoted by my dermatologist and also approved by the American Academy of Dermatologists, I assumed it was a good choice and safe for my sensitive skin.  After three months of using this product on a daily basis, my eyes became extremely sensitive due to the fumes emitted when I applied the product to my face and I developed conjunctivitis twice in one month; (the ophthalmologist who treated me assured me that the conjunctivitis was chemically induced and I had no reason to doubt him as I have no prior history of eye problems).  Stupidly, I persisted in using this product and have since developed a horrible rash across my entire face complete with broken capillaries and patches of melasma, (melasma was not a problem for me prior to using this product).  As I see it, it will take many more laser treatments to, hopefully, undo the damage done by this product.  I have researched several of the ingredients and discovered that one ingredient contains formaldehyde, (which would explain the burning in my eyes whenever I applied this product to my face).  If even one person reads this review and avoids this product, then I will have done my part as a concerned citizen.  My dermatologist no longer recommends this product to his patients and I feel very strongly that it should be recalled by the FDA, as it poses a significant threat to the very persons who would be most inclined to use it, those of us with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Good, the only reason it&#x27;s not a 5 is because it is sorta oily when you put it on, but it takes a little while to absorb.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in this product. If you have brown to dark skin this product will leave your face with a white residue. A friend of mine told me I looked like I tried to bleach my face and called me Sammy Sosa lol. I stopped using this product and went with a Aveno brand face moisturizer and I&#x27;m satisfied now.</li>
    <li> I have been use this product for 4-5 years now!</li>
    <li> I have super-sensitive Irish skin - and this is the best non-greasy moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever found. I use it under makeup - have not had any sunburn or age spots on my face since I started using this - I use it daily and will never start my day without putting it on my face and neck - and sometimes what&#x27;s left over on my hands I jsut rub into my hair. Works GREAT :)</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and this is my go to product. I am on my 3rd bottle, that says a lot as I am usually always changing products.</li>
    <li> I started using this stuff on my dermatologist&#x27;s recommendation. He said he prefers the Eucerin SPF 30 Daily Protection because it contains Titanium Dioxide and Zinc Oxide which are both physical screening agents. The lotion also contains traditional sunscreens. I apply this every morning and despite having somewhat acne-prone skin it hasn&#x27;t caused breakouts. I can definitely feel it when I touch my face, but it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy like most sunscreen - it just feels like the lotion never quite finished absorbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One downside you may find is that the Zinc Oxide and Titanium Dioxide make it a little bit more difficult to get the lotion to soak in and disappear. If you put it on a little too thick you&#x27;ll have to work rub it in. Also, your skin needs to be really, really dry when you apply it or you&#x27;ll wind up with white lotion spots that don&#x27;t soak in. Despite this, I still really like this lotion. I&#x27;m happy to have broad spectrum SPF 30 protection that doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out.</li>
    <li> perfect, non greasy and fragrance free, I am very happy</li>
    <li> Good for my face. Disappears with some rubbing.</li>
    <li> Great price we use it all the time</li>
    <li> did not absorb in my skin, leaves white traces all over my face.</li>
    <li> My frequent use as the doctors tells me.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to moisturizer that well unless I put a lot on. Even then, my skin would still be a little flaky from the dryness</li>
    <li> The worst moisturizer ever! It totally dried my skin out. I went back to my favorite QV.</li>
    <li> Works really well and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Items were damaged in shipment took 2 weeks to come but not amazons fault! but over all I like it protects my face from sun damage, perfect for putting on before makeup or alone. Has SPF 30 Just hate the white residue it leaves on your face.</li>
    <li> So far so good this facial moisturizer has been doing good things to my sensitive acne prone skin. Its got the spf, the size is perfect for the price, its non comedogenic and dermatologist recommended. Also not heavy at all :) The ONLY thing i dont like about this product is that it leaves a white residue after application. I just dab off the excess with some facial tissue and its gone. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> It is a very good product for my face and the most important thing is not greasy</li>
    <li> works well during winter</li>
    <li> I have an oily skin and this lotion is perfect because absorbing so fast and it isn&#x27;t oily</li>
    <li> It is a light weight moisturizer w/ SPF for sensitive skin in summer, but in winter, I would use a heavier or thicker moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I wear it daily and haven&#x27;t had a problem even though I have very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin too shine and with a greasy touch.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to use this as a daily moisturizer, but it is a little bit too greasy for my oily skin so I will only wear it when spending a lot of time out doors.</li>
    <li> Definitely moisturizes my skin but it does leave a white residue probably more due to the sun block in it. I put some foundation to bring it back to my complexion. I have sensitive acne prone skin. So far so good in that I haven&#x27;t noticed any breakouts from it or irritation either. Would repurchase and recommend.</li>
    <li> Good as a sunscreen. Caused major break out after 2 days of use. Although other reviewers were ok on this apparently i am not the one. Even for fair skinned person white film is obvious and in no way you can use and not look a bit like a ghost.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years and is working out just fine.  I use it as a daily sunscreen for my morning walks and going to the gym.  I apply it on my face and arms.  The lotion must be applied until it disappears, leaving no whiteness.</li>
    <li> Best face lotion, and the spf in it definitely helps on this warm sunny days!</li>
    <li> i love this face moisturizer. its so light and has spf! the only downfall is if you dont rub it in well itll leave your face white.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a firm believer in having some protection every day! Researchers shown that even small amounts of sun exposure every day cumulatively leads to accelerated aging of the skin. I&#x27;ve been using this for years. It&#x27;s not too thick, it&#x27;s light and easy to apply. I love it!</li>
    <li> This leaves a heavy white residue. I&#x27;ll have to buy sheer neutrogena spf 30 since i already threw out the packaging.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive but quality skin protection with zinc oxide so I can apply/reapply it more freely during the day. Adds sufficient moisture for large % of my skin. I am in my late sixties so I apply additional overnight moisturizer on my face and neck. A great contributing product to help maintain and to protect the body&#x27;s (young or old) 24/7 moisturizing balancing act.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion but the only downside is that my hands get sticky after applying it and cannot do it on the run. There needs to be a sink nearby so that excludes my putting it on in the car.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily moisturizer for years and I love it. The SPF 30 is what attracted me to it. It goes on light and does not look greasy or smell, as most sunscreen products do. Great product at such a cheap price!</li>
    <li> Not a bad moisturizer.  I wish the SPF was higher--I used another brand with SPF 50 that I liked, but this one is non-greasy and rubs in fairly easily.  Like most face lotions with SPF, it takes a little longer to rub in with the added benefit of sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this particular face lotion when I started to try and make all the products I use, not so chemically, plus it&#x27;s recommended by the cancer society...it does leave a while film but just rub it in real well and it goes away. It prevents me from getting sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;Oh its not very moisturizing so you might want to get a light lotion and apply this on top for sun protection</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the basic Eucerin daily moisturizer and should have stayed using that one because this one irritates my eyes. I obviously don&#x27;t put it in my eye but if a little gets in, I have to wash my eyes out because of the burning. I think it&#x27;s because of the sunscreen in to so I&#x27;m not using this daily, only for summer days and even if so, only on days I expect to be in sun.</li>
    <li> Lots of sun protection.  Did not irritate like other SPFs.</li>
    <li> lotion is perfect for spf protection and moisturizing and since it costs shipping I  ordered 5 to get free shipping so I guess im done for 2 years now!</li>
    <li> Great product especially for the price. Does not irritate skin and offers great sun protection. It&#x27;s not greasy but does leave skin slightly ghostly. On my 5th bottle now.</li>
    <li> I have nothing bad to say about this product. It leaves your skin soft, healthy, moisturized,not greasy and with a very light scent of sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been out in the sun a lot since I bought this product and I have yet to get a sunburn on my face even when the rest of my body gets sunburnt(have yet to find a good body moisturizer with SPF).&lt;br /&gt;And to make it even better, a little of this product goes a longggg way. The thin consistancy of the product makes it so I need just one small squirt to cover my face and neck, making the bottle last a long time which saves money :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My search for a facial moisturizer with SPF has come to an end with this product :) I love it :)</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for the same brand&#x27;s now discontinued daily moisturizing lotion SPF 30 (in the white and pink bottle), thinking that this product would be essentially the same.  I wanted a daily facial sunscreen with only mineral sunscreens, because many chemical sunscreens have been shown to negatively impact health and disrupt hormones. See this sunscreen safety chart: http://www.ewg.org/2014sunscreen/the-trouble-with-sunscreen-chemicals/  In the new product description, only mineral sunscreens Titanium Dioxide and Zinc Oxide are mentioned.  However, when I received this product and opened the label, 3 chemical sunscreens are included - Ensulizole, Octinoxate, and Octisalate.  These should have been mentioned online and clearly on the packaging.  Had they been, I would have known not to purchase.  Instead, I am now stuck with an expensive bottle of useless lotion.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer works very well for my Asian skin - it is one of very few that don&#x27;t cause my skin to break out. It also adds a bit of white sheen to my skin (my skin is light-medium brown so it is noticeable especially when I just put it on). However, if I sweat in the first hour or so after putting it on, I will look like I&#x27;m sweating milk. That is not too big of a problem (except during the summer) and I have been happy using it for the past couple of years.</li>
    <li> Nice creams for the protection or your screen</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended that I start using a 30spf moisturizer on my face, so I purchased Eucerin based on a lady I work with and her experience with the product. The moisturizer has 5 levels. It starts at lightweight and continues on to rich. The one I purchased was lightweight and it did go on smooth and it is light-weight as advertised. Because my skin is so dry, the next bottle I purchase will be more on the rich side because it absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> I really like it!! Not as bad as I was thinking. A little little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, the good news is that this didn&#x27;t break me out or cause a weird rash, however I normally wear Vanicream which I love if I could get the lite lotion with an spf (hope you read this Vanicream company) but this is good for deterring Suns signs of aging. It is a little greasy under makeup so I apply powder as a finisher.</li>
    <li> Always a favorite.  Soaks into skin without leaving a greasy residue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product almost every day for two years, and I just love it.  10 minutes after putting it on, you don&#x27;t even realize its there because it&#x27;s light and nongreasy.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but I will only use this sunblock on my face, since it never makes me feel sticky and gross.</li>
    <li> Eucerin lives up to its claims. I have been using this product for over 3 years. It does a great job protecting your face from the damaging effects of the sun.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  I wear it each day under makeup and even with my fair skin in the strong Colorado sun, I don&#x27;t get sunburned--even if I&#x27;m outside for hours.  I&#x27;ve recently started putting it on my cheeks at night and my complexion has only improved because of it.  No breakouts whatsoever.  I recommend this highly for anyone looking for a daily sunscreen that&#x27;s not oily/heavy and actually works (imagine that!).</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used probably 5 different sun lotions in my life. This has to be the best in terms of feel and ease of application. Also there is no strange smell.</li>
    <li> Thin, More like a lotion then a daily cream.</li>
    <li> I got this product from Walgreens and it serves all of my needs, it is fragrance free which is great because I don&#x27;t even realize I have it on during the day (unlike other spf facial products!). It has a great consistency, not too thin and not too thick, so it keeps my skin moist. It is the perfect lotion - it is not greasy and doesn&#x27;t make your skin look shiny. It doesn&#x27;t emit fumes into my eyes even when I use it in my eye area. It does make your face a teeny bit whiter than it is because of the ingredients but it&#x27;s not that noticeable if you spread it well and not leave smudges of it, so I&#x27;d definitely suggest checking the mirror after you applied it. Though other people said the pump isn&#x27;t great and clogs, I never had that problem, the lotion comes out smoothly and easily, and I can put the right amount of pressure to get the right amount I want. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this lotion!!</li>
    <li> Pretty disappointing for many reasons. The lotion is watery and it doesn&#x27;t really absorb into your skin. I have to rub it in and even when I do, it leaves a white film around the perimeter of my face. It irritates my eyes even though I don&#x27;t put it near the sensitive eye area. Also, it starts to flake off with my foundation near the end of the night. Will never buy again. I was hoping to replace my Clinique lotion with this one to save money but I guess I can&#x27;t :(</li>
    <li> Have used for many years.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good moisturizing face cream with UV protection. This is the best for your money on amazon. You literally need to use a pinch of it, for your entire face. And i can feel it working when I go to play tennis. I&#x27;m definitely buying this again, but I think its gonna last really long. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I had a sample size of this product and I really liked it. The price was just right and I&#x27;m loving how it soaks in. I use it every day under my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t need a lotion AND a sunscreen now. Cuts down on the products in my drawer. (it&#x27;s a very small drawer.)</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dermatoligist. Quite frankly, I was not wild about using a moisturizer but the sun screen additive was fine. I thought the product would be greasy. Much to my surprise,  upon application the product quickly absorbed into my skin and it was not messy or greasy at all. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Moisturizing without feeling oily.</li>
    <li> Best of the best.  Been using it since my dermatologist recommended it years ago.</li>
    <li> I consider this the best facial sunscreen and insist the children put it on after they brush their teeth in the morning.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Been using it for a couple of years now, and it&#x27;s really good.</li>
    <li> Non greasy and feels good on my face.  Does not leave your face white like some have written.  Maybe they are not rubbing it in.</li>
    <li> This product is nice for sensitive skin. It is light and non-greasy.  I use it every morning and even put some on my arms, as well as neck and face.  I live in a tropical climate, and it has saved me a few times when I am out in the sun unexpectedly.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a moisturizer with SPF 30 and no parabans.  Good product, good price, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It also has a nice light scent. It&#x27;s like a sunscreen scent but very very subtle.</li>
    <li> Great daily moisturizer! I had previously been using a different one but wanted one with SPF and I bought this one based off the good amazon reviews:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;You need very little to cover your face&lt;br /&gt;Almost no scent except &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; scent you&#x27;d recognize from other zinc-oxide products. Disappears after about 20 minutes, nobody will ever notice it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None that I can think of!</li>
    <li> I mix this moisturizer with my organic one and it goes on great. Protects my skin from the sun and leaves the skin feeling great. Can be kind of oily but so far I haven&#x27;t had to much trouble with oil control.</li>
    <li> Okay, this lotion is fantastic for my face. It goes on so light, and rubs in really well. There&#x27;s no offensive SPF smell, and I can&#x27;t get over how soft my face feels. I&#x27;m hooked for life.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and have been so happy that my dermatologist recommended Eucerin Daily Protection Moisturizing Face Lotion for my face. It also has broad spectrum SPF 30 sun protection in it. I use it daily and have ordered it more than once from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a few years now.  It&#x27;s lightweight, absorbs well and keeps my skin moisturized.  I like that it has SPF 30 to protect my skin from the sun.  I&#x27;ve tried many face lotions and I keep coming back to this one for daytime use.  It works well for me.</li>
    <li> II don&#x27;t use chemical sunscreens as I can taste them a few minutes after I apply them. This product which uses titanium and zinc oxide as sunscreen ingredients works perfectly. It is also effective as a moisturizer so I only have one product to put on in the morning. I&#x27;ve very happy with it. Plus it is economical. A good product and a good value.</li>
    <li> Eucerin Q10 Lotion is an amazing product.  I stopped using it because I was unable to find it locally and bought Nivea&#x27;s Q10 lotion and I can really tell the difference.  Nivea has a strong frangrance and feel it irritates my skin. Eucerin is very gentle, mild frangrance if any and absorbs quickly.  It it makes my skin look great.  I have gotten several compliments.  I just ordered 2 bottles.  I will not run out again.</li>
    <li> This product is not recommeded for individuals who have a darker complexion.  I am \\&quot;light\\&quot; skinned and I still have to work a little too hard to make sure that this product has completely disolved into my skin.  In certain lights you can clearly see where I have applied the product on my face.  Otherwise, gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Good Product.  I&#x27;m normally allergic to the SPF creams but I gave this one a shot and have had no bad reaction to it.  I like it a lot</li>
    <li> Recommended for a sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Was surprised that it didn&#x27;t make my combination skin oily, especially in the t-zone - but after reading the reviews I decided to try it.  Great sun protection and makes my skin feel good.  Very pleased!</li>
    <li> to get that high of an SPF, it uses oxides, you have to be sure and rub it in.</li>
    <li> I bought this after getting a sample from my dermatologist. It sinks in nicely on my skin without any whiteish cast. I have a medium-olive complexion and combination skin. This works really nicely without leaving me too dry or too greasy. I haven&#x27;t noticed any issues with breakouts. It doesn&#x27;t have any antioxidants or other skin-improving additions (though the sunscreen is important), so I wear an antioxidant serum underneath. They seem to work well together, and I&#x27;m quite happy with the product.</li>
    <li> This lotion did not work for me.  Whenever I use it, I find it difficult to rub in the white cream.  And even then, if I try and put make up on afterwards, the lotion pills up and comes off.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb at all.  I have very pale skin and have tried many moisturizers; this is one of the worst.</li>
    <li> Great product. Has exc.ellent coverage and is great for my skin because EVERYTHING breaks me out but this! Love this product.</li>
    <li> TOO BLUE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you put this on expect to your face to turn white/blue. it is too thick</li>
    <li> So far my fav day to day moisturizer. Wish it came in a higher SPF version.</li>
    <li> Good product.....appears to work well</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this pretty much every day for about 3 years. Before that I was using Neutrogena Ultra Sheer, and this is better than that because it&#x27;s not as shiny, and never stings. This is the only non-greasy sunscreen/moisturizer I&#x27;ve found that never stings on my sensitive skin, even on a cut that&#x27;s just been washed, or on sunburned skin. To make it more moisturizing, I put a bit of oil or glycerin and hyaluronic lotion with it. I wish this sunscreen literally felt like nothing was on my skin, but that&#x27;s not going to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main downside to this moisturizer is that it stays a bit white on your skin. On pale skin like mine, though, it doesn&#x27;t look white, it just makes my skin look better: some &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; products use mineral sunscreens, too, like Lush&#x27;s &#x27;Feel Younger Skin Tint&#x27; and Skin79 Balm).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone knows a better sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t cost $100 a bottle, I&#x27;d like to know!</li>
    <li> Not yet used, but very like this brand</li>
    <li> Left white streaks on my face, which is slightly tan.&lt;br /&gt;Feels more like a sunscreen than a moisturizer and it didn&#x27;t even really moisturize my face but latched onto the oily areas of my face (like my nose) and it just did not look good. I put BB cream over it, but then the consistency of this is like sunscreen that does not easily fade into the skin so it did not work with my BB cream, either.&lt;br /&gt;Probably would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Moisturizing works well and its not irritating but I don&#x27;t like using this because it leaves a white residue on my face.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday. My dermatologist highly recommends it.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a while and it has worked well for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very convenient !</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, not oily or greasy and even my wife ended up using it in Hawaii because her expensive stuff was not really offering any protection despite being the same SPF.</li>
    <li> A product I have  used for years.  The best.  Glad to get it for a good price from Amazon.  It is often not sold in my local stores; can&#x27;t imagine why.  We all use sunscreen and moisturizer...  this is perfect.</li>
    <li> Works great and my wife buys this stuff all the time. She swears by this stuff. It is the only type and maker she will use.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great so far - light, absorbs quickly, and I love that it&#x27;s got a halfway-decent SPF built in.</li>
    <li> use every day over my morning routine</li>
    <li> Use it every morning before going on my walks.  It was recommended by my dermatologist and is much cheaper here than in a drug store.</li>
    <li> This did the job of moisturizing, but it left a white wash across my face no matter how hard I tried to blend it into my skin.  I looked like a ghost! :( Tried to make the most of it by using it as body sunscreen for the beach, but it became runny white streaks when I got wet. Do NOT buy if you are even slightly tanned!</li>
    <li> I am always looking for good products to help me look and feel my best. I just tried this for the first time this week. Unfortunately for me I found it to leave a sort of white mask over my face. I experimented with using less, massaging the lotion in more, apply while my face is still a little damp, and nothing seems to work. I also found it didn&#x27;t moisturize very well for me. I had several dry patches on my neck after using it. This product may be serviceable as a sun screen, but not as a daily moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion because my senior co-worker recommended. She has been using this lotion for a long time and she has a very nice skin. She told me that I do not have to spend a lot of money to buy good products and I totally agree with it.</li>
    <li> This is the best daily moisturizer with 30 SPF I&#x27;ve found. It is not at all greasy.  It does go on somewhat &amp;#34; white&amp;#34;, so I mix a it with a few drops of tinted moisturizer (I use Balm Shelter) and it is looks very natural and provides good protection from the sun.</li>
    <li> Fantastic moisturizing lotion. Just a small amount works for me. It goes on a little thick, leaving a thin layer of white lotion, but after a minute or two it goes away.</li>
    <li> I love this brand, but was disappointed with this product. It leaves a white film all over my face and doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin. Im sure the protection is good but its not for me.</li>
    <li> The cream is indeed non-comedogenic and has very light texture.</li>
    <li> i love it that it&#x27;s cheap and it&#x27;s 30spf, but it always breaks me out. i tried 2 years ago, my skin broke out. i tried again, just because, and it broke again. would love to love it, but EUCERIN maker, ... why does this product break my skin out?? i am 33years old dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i gave this to my 63years old mother in law with dry skin and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I tried this product, and I like inmediatly, good sunscreen, no oily, my skin absorbs it in seconds.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels healthy with this. I have only one complain, when I sweating the product leaks  over my face.</li>
    <li> Finding a face moisturizer that is also SPF 30 and is fragrance-free.</li>
    <li> it is very bad ,and very dry.</li>
    <li> A total disappointment....one star for the nourishing moisturizing actives&lt;br /&gt;Pros:Good light weight,matte, non-comedogenic moisturizer suitable for sensitive and oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:Doesn&#x27;t rub in well, leaves horrible white spots and streaks.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and now found it at a lower price.</li>
    <li> Nice consistency and coverage!</li>
    <li> Beiersdorf makes great products that are reasonable in cost, this is one of them. Having moved to a semi-tropical climate, the sun has become an enemy of my skin. I never like lotions or creams, but had to do something to protect myself. This has become a part of my morning ritual. I put it on my face (from below my eyes down), ears, neck and arms. Not only has it kept me from sun issues, my skin is healthier looking (the moisturizer). So I help my skin keep moist and sunburn free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on my face below my eyes. I sweat a lot and the lotion runs stinging my eyes, they tell you not to get it in your eyes but it can&#x27;t be helped when you sweat, otherwise 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One product does it all.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer! Didn&#x27;t make my skin greasy.  A must have for daily protection from the sun</li>
    <li> This product does not work well for dark African-American skin. When I applied the moisturizer on my face, it left a white film on my face as if I did not blend it on my face properly.</li>
    <li> After I purchased it, the price drop off. Oh my god.</li>
    <li> My skin is a nice tan and when I wear this on my face , it seems like I&#x27;m wearing two shades lighter than my natural color. I&#x27;m ghostly !!!</li>
    <li> THE SMELL IS GOOD, NOT THAT HEAVY, I LIKE IT, AND IT IS NOT SO STICKY, ABSORB EASILY.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. Is not sticky or smelly. Works great.</li>
    <li> Long time user.  Good product with sun protection.  Easy to use, no big mess.  Love the automatic daily face sun protection.  Use it every day, sun or not.</li>
    <li> It is entirely too thick. It has to be diluted with oil in order for it to be absorbed by my skin...or else my face appears white.</li>
</ol>
