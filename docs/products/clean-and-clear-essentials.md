      <li>This moisturizer is really good.</li>

      <li>This stuff feels like Amazing silk going on the skin.!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will be continue buying this amazing product.</li>
      <li>Sometimes when putting on shirts (that I wash with a nicely scented detergent)</li>
      <li>Works nicely as a moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Good value, doesn&#x27;t treat breakouts very quickly alone but is great for after astringents and before bed to prevent overnight flare-ups  Cooling with a pleasant mild scent.</li>
      <li>One of the more effective treatments I&#x27;ve found for my acne prone skin.  </li>
      <li>In the morning, I wake up, wash my face with warm water and apply some more of this moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>It leaves a nice tingly feeling on the skin (refreshing not at all burning.)It does not have sunscreen in it, but sunscreen is  skin protectant and this is a MOISTURIZER.</li>
      <li>It smells great, is lightweight, and is overall just a great moisturizer.</li>

      <li>glad i purchased</li>
      <li>Love this moisturizer</li>
      <li>*LOVE</li>
      <li>I wish I could give it more than just 5 stars.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>My face looks brighter and the tone is more evened out.</li>
      <li>how effective this alone would be at helping with breakouts, but I love how light it is.</li>
      <li>Note: I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 weeks+, so I could be sure of the results.</li>
      <li>IDK why I keep thinking there is a better moisturizer out there that won&#x27;t break my face out like this one.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff and cheaper than in the store</li>
      <li>Much better than proactive.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I got most these products at Walmart and Walgreens.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for keeping my face soft and smooth, without breaking out.</li>
      <li>and i am 99.9% satisfied with this</li>
      <li>but instead, I have more peeling after I applied this on my face.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for many years.</li>
      <li>I love how lite weight the formula is</li>
      <li>have oily skin for the most part</li>
      <li>I mostly used this at night and used the Morning Burst with spf moisturizer in the daytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I needed just a bit more of moisture</li>
      <li>just wanted to say i love</li>
      <li>It did not do wonders to my skin, but it did not make me breakout more.</li>
      <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
      <li>Clean and Clear gives it the perfect amount</li>
      <li>This Clean and Clear moisturizer is perfect.</li>
      <li>It also has a nice, clean smell to it.</li>
      <li>Works pretty good for the price.</li>
      <li>It can dry out your skin if you use it too often, but once a day is perfect for this product.</li>
      <li>* the tingly clean feeling!</li>
      <li>Finish up that shave, get a nice hot towel on your face, and finish up with a dab of this stuff!</li>
      <li>In the winter, I sometimes supplement this lotion with something a bit more moisturizing but this is my primary face lotion for the rest of the year.</li>
      <li>The Target generic brand is AMAZING, I honestly would give it a 5/5!</li>
      <li>It gives your skin a nice fresh tingly sensation upon application.</li>
      <li>Before this moisturizer I was easily pimple prone and oily faced.</li>
      <li>This soaks in easily and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
      <li>lotion absorbs into skin very quickly with no greasy residue.</li>
      <li>I find myself putting this product on my face all the time just to feel that refreshing, cool sensation.</li>
      <li>Other than that the smell is good and quality is good</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend you use oil free products like this.</li>
      <li>I would say this product would be great for someone who breaks out with light acne very occasionally, and who is looking for a *nighttime* moisturizer for the oily areas of the face.</li>
      <li>i get this cheap now on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>It is light, cooling, and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.  </li>
      <li>lotion/acne-clearer possibly available on the market from the time I was 13</li>
      <li>I stress all this as I find it EXTREMELY important when giving this product the review I&#x27;m going to give it.  </li>
      <li>It feels light on the face and works well on combination skin types.</li>
      <li>It is light and absorbs well.  </li>
      <li>It works really great for my moderate acne.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This seems like it keeps my skin bright as well as clear</li>
      <li>If you get breakouts on your back or shoulders or chest, this works great for those areas as well.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;ve been looking for a cheap oil free moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve came across aveeno oil free moisturizer</li>
      <li>I feel it working, it makes my face look &amp; feel smooth</li>
      <li>sure the real version of this product works AMAZINGLY WELL since I love the Target version so much.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, it gave my face a cool tingly sensation that I LOVE because it feels so refreshing and clean.</li>
      <li>Clean &amp; Clear&#x27;s Oil-Free Dual Action Moisturizer is an excellent affordable way to keep your face moisturized and under control.</li>
      <li>I would like to think that the acne medication has the best time to absorb into my skin while I&#x27;m sleeping as opposed to wearing it outside in the sunlight, where it would make my face even dryer than normal.</li>
      <li>Moisturize and keep a clean face.....</li>
      <li>Smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry skin.</li>
      <li>Finally I&#x27;ve found a Clean &amp; Clear product that works great for me!</li>
      <li>I would wash my face and put this on afterwards and my face just felt so clean and tingly.</li>
      <li>using this, my skin was squeaky clean</li>
      <li>This feels clean and non-oily on your skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizers and most of the time, it would dry up my skin more, or leave it too greasy.</li>
      <li>(nothing special), but in terms of treating pimples, this dual-action product leaves its promise unfulfilled.</li>
      <li>But, if you are just a high school/college girl who is looking for an economical moisturizer, this one is pretty good.</li>
      <li>Also I pump three times for full face lotion cover.  </li>
      <li>For its price range, it is good enough.</li>
      <li>I used it in good faith for a couple of months, though I occasionally skipped it.</li>
      <li>I will continue to purchase it, it is also very affordable which makes it even better.  </li>
      <li>It makes my makeup look fresh and it goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>the only thing it is good for is if you want to put a moisturizer on before makeup.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my face feeling fresh and light weight.</li>
      <li>Also, there is the claim that it &amp;#34;treats and prevents pimples&amp;#34;, which is partially true.</li>
      <li>You get a full 4 ounces for the price.    </li>
      <li>i would use it on my face at night after cleansing, and when i wake up the bumps would be almost gone, its a good moisturizer, if only it would get rid of acne scars</li>
      <li>This moisturizer is super light and makes you feel fresh.</li>
      <li>The lotion goes on clear and dispenses from a pump top for easy application.</li>
      <li>Additionally, it&#x27;s oil-free, so it seeps in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy look/residue.</li>
      <li>I have super oily/acne prone skin and have been looking for a setting moisturizer to put on after cleansing and before makeup.</li>
      <li>I immediately went out to Target and bought it (at a super affordable price).</li>
      <li>Mild scented and leaves you with a clean fresh feeling face.</li>
      <li>It goes on quick and leaves no residue.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s tingly, It absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>It gives your face just the right about of moisture it needs to control oil production, while leaving you feeling refreshed and clean.</li>
      <li>Surprisingly, this stuff doesn&#x27;t make my face oily or dry and helps alongside my face wash.</li>
      <li>It absorbs very quickly and has helped my skin so much.</li>
      <li>I have always been an avid consumer of water, but I&#x27;ve added the vitamin C recently, which I&#x27;ve heard is really good for your skin.</li>
      <li>I love it &amp; it smells good &amp; NO MORE OILY SKIN when it&#x27;s on my face.</li>
      <li>makes face feel tingly fresh.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, doesn&#x27;t clog the pores, keeps my skin clear, goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>Not only have I found the absolute perfect moisterizer, but for my personal skin condition, it truly does all it states.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I finally found a moisturizer which really is oil-free although I wouldn&#x27;t use it on my nose (my most oiliest spot)</li>
      <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>and I rarely have break outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It leaves a bit of a refreshing, tingly sensation when used directly after a shower.</li>
      <li>I use it in conjunction with Acne Free benzoyl peroxide cleanser and Clean &amp; Clear rapid acne pads</li>
      <li>I then wash it off or sometimes use an electric toothbrush (not the one for my teeth!!) and use it to gently massage my face as I wash off the mask with cool water.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to perfumes and the fragrance in this moisturizer was too strong for me.</li>
      <li>It keeps my face pimple free and very soft but not overly oily.</li>
      <li>I am so happy I found this stuff to begin with and even happier I found it as subscribe and save on Amazon because sometimes it is really hard to find in the stores.</li>
      <li>I have pretty clear skin, so this is very good for just overall red or bumpy skin.</li>
      <li>She probably will switch to higher end products though, as she will turn 22 soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The only way this product could be better would be if they added sun protection to it.  </li>
      <li>the kind where I have to be careful to wash my bedsheets with odor-free detergent.</li>
      <li>Hence, most of the \\&quot;Guaranteed\\&quot; products out there made me face swell up like a red water-balloon literally (Proactiv).  </li>
      <li>For the first time in my life, I reached for the save.  </li>
      <li>This product has become so essential to him that we order through subscribe and save to make sure he doesn&#x27;t run out.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, it&#x27;s every penny of the price, and I&#x27;m looking forward to more such products.</li>
      <li>But I must say overall, I love this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s safe for daily use as well.</li>
      <li>This moisturizer smoothens and hydrates my skin all day, really!</li>
      <li>First of all, this a moisturizer with salicyclic acid.  </li>
      <li>NO lotion has ever worked in treating it (and I have tried MANY different matte lotions)</li>
      <li>Thanks Clean-and-Clear!</li>
      <li>I have pretty oily skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different moisturizers and creams-</li>
      <li>I find the clinque lotion far better to moisturize and this is allergly tested and totally fragrance free</li>
      <li>of the breakouts cleared up with continued use one week after my first review.</li>
      <li>Work great on my skin and last long.</li>
      <li>and it really does work!  </li>
      <li>Way to go, Clean and Clear!</li>
      <li>This product is great for winter days when I need that extra moisture for dry skin without adding oil.</li>
      <li>It helps my face stay clean and clear of acne.</li>
      <li>But my cleanser isn&#x27;t from Clean &amp; Clear.</li>
      <li>I suppose you have to use the Clean &amp; Clear cleanser if you don&#x27;t want a reaction afterwards.</li>
      <li>used this with the Morning Burst products and the Blackhead Clearing products from Clean &amp; Clear.</li>
      <li>She is using it in conjunction with the facewash by Clean and Clear.</li>
      <li>ok i use this for long time now.</li>
      <li>This one sinks right into your skin, drying very quickly, leaving you with a soft, smooth feeling.</li>
      <li>If your face is brutally dry I would go with somthing a bit heavier as this is light, totally worth the money.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many different moisturizers and cleansers and have found that this is more effective than any other that I have used, including more expensive names like Clinique and Mary Kay.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to have that little bit of anti-acne stuff in the product, but I&#x27;d use this even without that ingredient.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have severe huge white-head acne, but do have moderate acne where my face is pack-full of bumps everywhere.</li>
      <li>Makes your skin feel very good.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The sensation gradually declined, and now I don&#x27;t feel it so much.</li>
      <li>It may work for you, but it really just didn&#x27;t do what it claims.</li>
      <li>and then I have an allergic reaction in that very spot.</li>
      <li>I would need something much stronger for winter.</li>
      <li>I also really like the packaging.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m twenty nine and have always had acne and very oily skin.  </li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t have to apply a whole lot of it on.</li>
      <li>However, I may have just been very diligent with my skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m afraid this wasn&#x27;t the best product for me to choose, however.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s very inexpensive to use.</li>
      <li>The product did not really moisturize my face for more than 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>This really helped keep it under control.</li>
      <li>A bit ironic for a moisturizer if you ask me.</li>
      <li>I would absolutely buy this product again</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like having mint on your face and walking outside on a cool, crisp morning.</li>
      <li>It also smells nice and has a very slight cooling effect.  </li>
      <li>I actually bought it on sale from Ulta originally, but I am now at a seasonal job in the boonies which requires me to make my orders online.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I ended up buying the Wal-Mart brand because I left my original bottle at my mom&#x27;s house.</li>
      <li>Its fine, as long as you don&#x27;t use another product with it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It went on nicely but actually made my skin feel dry</li>
      <li>understand that products have to clear out the dirt and oil first, but if this doesn&#x27;t improve in one week, this is going in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/24</li>
      <li>I normally buy this product from Target, but I was out and had a very hectic week, so I ordered this with my amazon prime.  </li>
      <li>This facial moisturizer definitely leaves my skin feeling fresh and smooth.</li>
      <li>My skin is pretty oily naturally and, without moisturizer, gets even moreso.</li>
      <li>I might be good for someone who has only occasional, light acne along with oily skin, but for those of us with moderate acne and dry skin?</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a lot more watered down than the Target version and takes several more applications to finally work.</li>
      <li>This is the one moisturizer that works, and that is important because his acne medications can often leave his face dry and irritated.</li>
      <li>This has helped me feel so much better about myself and less self-conscious when talking to people.</li>
      <li>I have combination skin, and I mainly break out in my t-zone.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough that I can put it on my face right after shaving, and it doesn&#x27;t sting or burn.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this lotion since I was in High School and am now 33.  </li>
      <li>I am a big fan of Clean &amp; Clear products.</li>
      <li>I have actually never purchased the Clean and Clear product itself, but I have tried both the Wal-Mart brand and the Target brand of this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and absorbs well with absolutely NO greasiness.  </li>
      <li>Overall I feel this product is worth the money and effort.</li>
      <li>It is normal.</li>
      <li>so that isn&#x27;t a problem for me, but I also struggle with moderate adult acne and don&#x27;t feel this is strong enough to really take care of it.</li>
      <li>Luckily when I reached my early twenties my breakouts became only bothersome once</li>
      <li>I am fine with a basic moisturizer, face wash, and nightly AHA treatment, as well has an occasional BHA treatment for when I do get acne.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge improvement in overall acne, but my skin definitely looks fresher and softer.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t switch back to Clean &amp; Clear fast enough.</li>
      <li>I have tried many different moisturizers, from the ridiculously expensive to the dirt cheap and this is the product that has consistently delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I picked this stuff up thinking it&#x27;d be useful for my dry, acne prone skin.</li>
      <li>It keeps my skin feeling fresh and moisturized after I use my facewash cleanser that often makes my skin dry.</li>
      <li>I break out quite easily on my forehead, and have a few blackheads on my nose.</li>
      <li>so when I woke up the next day I had so many little white in those exact spots.</li>
      <li>It has a cool, tingly feeling that I haven&#x27;t found in any other lotion.</li>
      <li>I now wash with Neutrogena Body Clear Body Wash with salicylic acid, and then use this.  </li>
      <li>I went to the dermatologist then and my dermatologist recommended this lotion along with a soap with Salicylic Acid in it to help keep my skin clear.</li>
      <li>I used this when I was a teenager to keep my skin clear.</li>
      <li>no heavy or greasy</li>
      <li>I like to include neck too because old people neck sag.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheaper here on Amazon than at Ulta, and the shipping is at most  day late.     </li>
      <li>I am *that* sensitive.</li>
      <li>and i like it so far.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this lotion since I was a young teenager.</li>
      <li>It does not say it is for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t make me greasy and leaves my skin soft.</li>
      <li>My skin is pretty acne-prone and dry to begin with</li>
      <li>and I can say that it is well worth the money compared to other products on the market.</li>
      <li>and I was still spot touching dry patches of skin with a heavy duty body lotion.</li>
      <li>(It actually works really well as an after-shave conditioner; seems to help prevent red bumps and ingrown hairs!)  </li>
      <li>If it simply felt like a &#x27;masked&#x27; feeling in the face, then it simply did absolutely nothing for me and didn&#x27;t help the dryness at all.  </li>
      <li>Then, I was reading the back of the dual action bottled when I found a statement that it MAY cause dryness!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have any cystic acne which is a major plus.</li>
      <li>but I still see a major difference in my skin compared to before</li>
      <li>I finally had figured out what worked for my skin and had a semi clear face with a pimple or two here</li>
      <li>younger looking skin on my already young looking man face.  </li>
      <li>I am a male and I have adult acne.  </li>
      <li>for any moisturizer you have to be careful to not put on so much because your face will get oily.</li>
      <li>I do not have sensitive skin and only experience a cooling sensation after applying.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this Dual action moisturizer for the last 2 years every day and it works well.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who has oily (or dry) skin and needs a product that won&#x27;t make it even oilier.</li>
      <li>To make that search all the more difficult, I am incredibly SENSITIVE skin...</li>
      <li>After I wash my face, I put a thin layer of this only on my cheeks, sometimes my chin where I break out most,</li>
      <li>When I first got this I was a little skeptical because I had bought other moisturizers that claimed to make my face feel clean and fresh</li>
      <li>Most moisturizers I have used feel heavy on my skin and feel oily and slick.</li>
      <li>only has half a percent of salicylic acid, which makes me wonder how it could really be that effective.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product works well as a moisturizer, and soaks into the skin quickly, leaving a soft feeling behind, no grease or residue.</li>

<li> Good price too.</li>
<li> This moisturizer is really good.</li>

<li> Love it!  </li>
<li> but this moisturizer sure helps!</li>
<li> I love this product!  </li>

<li> this moisturizer is amazing..</li>

<li> I will be continue buying this amazing product.</li>
<li> Sometimes when putting on shirts (that I wash with a nicely scented detergent)</li>
<li> Works nicely as a moisturizer.</li>
<li> Good value, doesn&#x27;t treat breakouts very quickly alone but is great for after astringents and before bed to prevent overnight flare-ups  Cooling with a pleasant mild scent.</li>
<li> One of the more effective treatments I&#x27;ve found for my acne prone skin.  </li>
<li> In the morning, I wake up, wash my face with warm water and apply some more of this moisturizer.  </li>
<li> It leaves a nice tingly feeling on the skin (refreshing not at all burning.)It does not have sunscreen in it, but sunscreen is  skin protectant and this is a MOISTURIZER.</li>
<li> It smells great, is lightweight, and is overall just a great moisturizer.</li>
<li> i absolutely love this oil free lotion it makes my skin feel smooth and great with or without makeup</li>
<li> Non oily helps with light acme and is very refreshing.</li>
<li> Very light</li>
<li> Pretty nice feel to use it, good effect on your skin.&lt;br</li>
<li> love this lotion because it is very light.  </li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;i love using after i exfoliate or when im done cleansing after wearing make up</li>
<li> glad i purchased</li>
<li> Love this moisturizer</li>
<li> *LOVE</li>
<li> I wish I could give it more than just 5 stars.  </li>
<li> Absolutely love it.</li>
<li> My face looks brighter and the tone is more evened out.</li>
<li> how effective this alone would be at helping with breakouts, but I love how light it is.</li>
<li> Note: I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 weeks+, so I could be sure of the results.</li>
<li> IDK why I keep thinking there is a better moisturizer out there that won&#x27;t break my face out like this one.</li>
<li> Love this stuff and cheaper than in the store</li>
<li> Much better than proactive.</li>
<li> I absolutely love this moisturizer.</li>
<li> I got most these products at Walmart and Walgreens.</li>
<li> Love this stuff.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s perfect for keeping my face soft and smooth, without breaking out.</li>
<li> and i am 99.9% satisfied with this</li>
<li> but instead, I have more peeling after I applied this on my face.</li>
<li> okay</li>
<li> I have been using this product for many years.</li>
<li> I love how lite weight the formula is</li>
<li> have oily skin for the most part</li>
<li> I mostly used this at night and used the Morning Burst with spf moisturizer in the daytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> but I needed just a bit more of moisture</li>
<li> just wanted to say i love</li>
<li> It did not do wonders to my skin, but it did not make me breakout more.</li>
<li> What more could you ask for?</li>
<li> Clean and Clear gives it the perfect amount</li>
<li> This Clean and Clear moisturizer is perfect.</li>
<li> It also has a nice, clean smell to it.</li>
<li> Works pretty good for the price.</li>
<li> It can dry out your skin if you use it too often, but once a day is perfect for this product.</li>
<li> * the tingly clean feeling!</li>
<li> Finish up that shave, get a nice hot towel on your face, and finish up with a dab of this stuff!</li>
<li> In the winter, I sometimes supplement this lotion with something a bit more moisturizing but this is my primary face lotion for the rest of the year.</li>
<li> The Target generic brand is AMAZING, I honestly would give it a 5/5!</li>
<li> It gives your skin a nice fresh tingly sensation upon application.</li>
<li> Before this moisturizer I was easily pimple prone and oily faced.</li>
<li> This soaks in easily and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
<li> lotion absorbs into skin very quickly with no greasy residue.</li>
<li> I find myself putting this product on my face all the time just to feel that refreshing, cool sensation.</li>
<li> Other than that the smell is good and quality is good</li>
<li> I strongly recommend you use oil free products like this.</li>
<li> I would say this product would be great for someone who breaks out with light acne very occasionally, and who is looking for a *nighttime* moisturizer for the oily areas of the face.</li>
<li> i get this cheap now on Amazon.  </li>
<li> It is light, cooling, and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.  </li>
<li> lotion/acne-clearer possibly available on the market from the time I was 13</li>
<li> I stress all this as I find it EXTREMELY important when giving this product the review I&#x27;m going to give it.  </li>
<li> It feels light on the face and works well on combination skin types.</li>
<li> It is light and absorbs well.  </li>
<li> It works really great for my moderate acne.</li>
<li> /&gt;This seems like it keeps my skin bright as well as clear</li>
<li> If you get breakouts on your back or shoulders or chest, this works great for those areas as well.</li>
<li> So I&#x27;ve been looking for a cheap oil free moisturizer.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve came across aveeno oil free moisturizer</li>
<li> I feel it working, it makes my face look &amp; feel smooth</li>
<li> sure the real version of this product works AMAZINGLY WELL since I love the Target version so much.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s light.</li>
<li> The first time I used it, it gave my face a cool tingly sensation that I LOVE because it feels so refreshing and clean.</li>
<li> Clean &amp; Clear&#x27;s Oil-Free Dual Action Moisturizer is an excellent affordable way to keep your face moisturized and under control.</li>
<li> I would like to think that the acne medication has the best time to absorb into my skin while I&#x27;m sleeping as opposed to wearing it outside in the sunlight, where it would make my face even dryer than normal.</li>
<li> Moisturize and keep a clean face.....</li>
<li> Smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry skin.</li>
<li> Finally I&#x27;ve found a Clean &amp; Clear product that works great for me!</li>
<li> I would wash my face and put this on afterwards and my face just felt so clean and tingly.</li>
<li> using this, my skin was squeaky clean</li>
<li> This feels clean and non-oily on your skin.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizers and most of the time, it would dry up my skin more, or leave it too greasy.</li>
<li> (nothing special), but in terms of treating pimples, this dual-action product leaves its promise unfulfilled.</li>
<li> But, if you are just a high school/college girl who is looking for an economical moisturizer, this one is pretty good.</li>
<li> Also I pump three times for full face lotion cover.  </li>
<li> For its price range, it is good enough.</li>
<li> I used it in good faith for a couple of months, though I occasionally skipped it.</li>
<li> I will continue to purchase it, it is also very affordable which makes it even better.  </li>
<li> It makes my makeup look fresh and it goes on smoothly.</li>
<li> the only thing it is good for is if you want to put a moisturizer on before makeup.  </li>
<li> It leaves my face feeling fresh and light weight.</li>
<li> Also, there is the claim that it &amp;#34;treats and prevents pimples&amp;#34;, which is partially true.</li>
<li> You get a full 4 ounces for the price.    </li>
<li> i would use it on my face at night after cleansing, and when i wake up the bumps would be almost gone, its a good moisturizer, if only it would get rid of acne scars</li>
<li> This moisturizer is super light and makes you feel fresh.</li>
<li> The lotion goes on clear and dispenses from a pump top for easy application.</li>
<li> Additionally, it&#x27;s oil-free, so it seeps in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy look/residue.</li>
<li> I have super oily/acne prone skin and have been looking for a setting moisturizer to put on after cleansing and before makeup.</li>
<li> I immediately went out to Target and bought it (at a super affordable price).</li>
<li> Mild scented and leaves you with a clean fresh feeling face.</li>
<li> It goes on quick and leaves no residue.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s tingly, It absorbs quickly.</li>
<li> It gives your face just the right about of moisture it needs to control oil production, while leaving you feeling refreshed and clean.</li>
<li> Surprisingly, this stuff doesn&#x27;t make my face oily or dry and helps alongside my face wash.</li>
<li> It absorbs very quickly and has helped my skin so much.</li>
<li> I have always been an avid consumer of water, but I&#x27;ve added the vitamin C recently, which I&#x27;ve heard is really good for your skin.</li>
<li> I love it &amp; it smells good &amp; NO MORE OILY SKIN when it&#x27;s on my face.</li>
<li> makes face feel tingly fresh.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s light, doesn&#x27;t clog the pores, keeps my skin clear, goes on smoothly.</li>
<li> Not only have I found the absolute perfect moisterizer, but for my personal skin condition, it truly does all it states.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m glad I finally found a moisturizer which really is oil-free although I wouldn&#x27;t use it on my nose (my most oiliest spot)</li>
<li> Definitely worth it.</li>
<li> and I rarely have break outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> It leaves a bit of a refreshing, tingly sensation when used directly after a shower.</li>
<li> I use it in conjunction with Acne Free benzoyl peroxide cleanser and Clean &amp; Clear rapid acne pads</li>
<li> I then wash it off or sometimes use an electric toothbrush (not the one for my teeth!!) and use it to gently massage my face as I wash off the mask with cool water.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m sensitive to perfumes and the fragrance in this moisturizer was too strong for me.</li>
<li> It keeps my face pimple free and very soft but not overly oily.</li>
<li> I am so happy I found this stuff to begin with and even happier I found it as subscribe and save on Amazon because sometimes it is really hard to find in the stores.</li>
<li> I have pretty clear skin, so this is very good for just overall red or bumpy skin.</li>
<li> She probably will switch to higher end products though, as she will turn 22 soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The only way this product could be better would be if they added sun protection to it.  </li>
<li> the kind where I have to be careful to wash my bedsheets with odor-free detergent.</li>
<li> Hence, most of the \\&quot;Guaranteed\\&quot; products out there made me face swell up like a red water-balloon literally (Proactiv).  </li>
<li> For the first time in my life, I reached for the save.  </li>
<li> This product has become so essential to him that we order through subscribe and save to make sure he doesn&#x27;t run out.</li>
<li> /&gt;Anyway, it&#x27;s every penny of the price, and I&#x27;m looking forward to more such products.</li>
<li> But I must say overall, I love this product.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s safe for daily use as well.</li>
<li> This moisturizer smoothens and hydrates my skin all day, really!</li>
<li> First of all, this a moisturizer with salicyclic acid.  </li>
<li> NO lotion has ever worked in treating it (and I have tried MANY different matte lotions)</li>
<li> Thanks Clean-and-Clear!</li>
<li> I have pretty oily skin</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried many different moisturizers and creams-</li>
<li> I find the clinque lotion far better to moisturize and this is allergly tested and totally fragrance free</li>
<li> of the breakouts cleared up with continued use one week after my first review.</li>
<li> Work great on my skin and last long.</li>
<li> and it really does work!  </li>
<li> Way to go, Clean and Clear!</li>
<li> This product is great for winter days when I need that extra moisture for dry skin without adding oil.</li>
<li> It helps my face stay clean and clear of acne.</li>
<li> But my cleanser isn&#x27;t from Clean &amp; Clear.</li>
<li> I suppose you have to use the Clean &amp; Clear cleanser if you don&#x27;t want a reaction afterwards.</li>
<li> used this with the Morning Burst products and the Blackhead Clearing products from Clean &amp; Clear.</li>
<li> She is using it in conjunction with the facewash by Clean and Clear.</li>
<li> ok i use this for long time now.</li>
<li> This one sinks right into your skin, drying very quickly, leaving you with a soft, smooth feeling.</li>
<li> If your face is brutally dry I would go with somthing a bit heavier as this is light, totally worth the money.</li>
<li> I have tried so many different moisturizers and cleansers and have found that this is more effective than any other that I have used, including more expensive names like Clinique and Mary Kay.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s nice to have that little bit of anti-acne stuff in the product, but I&#x27;d use this even without that ingredient.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have severe huge white-head acne, but do have moderate acne where my face is pack-full of bumps everywhere.</li>
<li> Makes your skin feel very good.&lt;br</li>
<li> The sensation gradually declined, and now I don&#x27;t feel it so much.</li>
<li> It may work for you, but it really just didn&#x27;t do what it claims.</li>
<li> and then I have an allergic reaction in that very spot.</li>
<li> I would need something much stronger for winter.</li>
<li> I also really like the packaging.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m twenty nine and have always had acne and very oily skin.  </li>
<li> You don&#x27;t have to apply a whole lot of it on.</li>
<li> However, I may have just been very diligent with my skin</li>
<li> I&#x27;m afraid this wasn&#x27;t the best product for me to choose, however.</li>
<li> so it&#x27;s very inexpensive to use.</li>
<li> The product did not really moisturize my face for more than 10 minutes.</li>
<li> This really helped keep it under control.</li>
<li> A bit ironic for a moisturizer if you ask me.</li>
<li> I would absolutely buy this product again</li>
<li> It&#x27;s like having mint on your face and walking outside on a cool, crisp morning.</li>
<li> It also smells nice and has a very slight cooling effect.  </li>
<li> I actually bought it on sale from Ulta originally, but I am now at a seasonal job in the boonies which requires me to make my orders online.</li>
<li> /&gt;I ended up buying the Wal-Mart brand because I left my original bottle at my mom&#x27;s house.</li>
<li> Its fine, as long as you don&#x27;t use another product with it.</li>
<li> /&gt;It went on nicely but actually made my skin feel dry</li>
<li> understand that products have to clear out the dirt and oil first, but if this doesn&#x27;t improve in one week, this is going in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/24</li>
<li> I normally buy this product from Target, but I was out and had a very hectic week, so I ordered this with my amazon prime.  </li>
<li> This facial moisturizer definitely leaves my skin feeling fresh and smooth.</li>
<li> My skin is pretty oily naturally and, without moisturizer, gets even moreso.</li>
<li> I might be good for someone who has only occasional, light acne along with oily skin, but for those of us with moderate acne and dry skin?</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a lot more watered down than the Target version and takes several more applications to finally work.</li>
<li> This is the one moisturizer that works, and that is important because his acne medications can often leave his face dry and irritated.</li>
<li> This has helped me feel so much better about myself and less self-conscious when talking to people.</li>
<li> I have combination skin, and I mainly break out in my t-zone.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s gentle enough that I can put it on my face right after shaving, and it doesn&#x27;t sting or burn.  </li>
<li> I have been using this lotion since I was in High School and am now 33.  </li>
<li> I am a big fan of Clean &amp; Clear products.</li>
<li> I have actually never purchased the Clean and Clear product itself, but I have tried both the Wal-Mart brand and the Target brand of this moisturizer.</li>
<li> It goes on smoothly and absorbs well with absolutely NO greasiness.  </li>
<li> Overall I feel this product is worth the money and effort.</li>
<li> It is normal.</li>
<li> so that isn&#x27;t a problem for me, but I also struggle with moderate adult acne and don&#x27;t feel this is strong enough to really take care of it.</li>
<li> Luckily when I reached my early twenties my breakouts became only bothersome once</li>
<li> I am fine with a basic moisturizer, face wash, and nightly AHA treatment, as well has an occasional BHA treatment for when I do get acne.</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge improvement in overall acne, but my skin definitely looks fresher and softer.</li>
<li> I couldn&#x27;t switch back to Clean &amp; Clear fast enough.</li>
<li> I have tried many different moisturizers, from the ridiculously expensive to the dirt cheap and this is the product that has consistently delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I picked this stuff up thinking it&#x27;d be useful for my dry, acne prone skin.</li>
<li> It keeps my skin feeling fresh and moisturized after I use my facewash cleanser that often makes my skin dry.</li>
<li> I break out quite easily on my forehead, and have a few blackheads on my nose.</li>
<li> so when I woke up the next day I had so many little white in those exact spots.</li>
<li> It has a cool, tingly feeling that I haven&#x27;t found in any other lotion.</li>
<li> I now wash with Neutrogena Body Clear Body Wash with salicylic acid, and then use this.  </li>
<li> I went to the dermatologist then and my dermatologist recommended this lotion along with a soap with Salicylic Acid in it to help keep my skin clear.</li>
<li> I used this when I was a teenager to keep my skin clear.</li>
<li> no heavy or greasy</li>
<li> I like to include neck too because old people neck sag.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s cheaper here on Amazon than at Ulta, and the shipping is at most  day late.     </li>
<li> I am *that* sensitive.</li>
<li> and i like it so far.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion since I was a young teenager.</li>
<li> It does not say it is for sensitive skin.  </li>
<li> but I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.  </li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t make me greasy and leaves my skin soft.</li>
<li> My skin is pretty acne-prone and dry to begin with</li>
<li> and I can say that it is well worth the money compared to other products on the market.</li>
<li> and I was still spot touching dry patches of skin with a heavy duty body lotion.</li>
<li> (It actually works really well as an after-shave conditioner; seems to help prevent red bumps and ingrown hairs!)  </li>
<li> If it simply felt like a &#x27;masked&#x27; feeling in the face, then it simply did absolutely nothing for me and didn&#x27;t help the dryness at all.  </li>
<li> Then, I was reading the back of the dual action bottled when I found a statement that it MAY cause dryness!</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have any cystic acne which is a major plus.</li>
<li> but I still see a major difference in my skin compared to before</li>
<li> I finally had figured out what worked for my skin and had a semi clear face with a pimple or two here</li>
<li> younger looking skin on my already young looking man face.  </li>
<li> I am a male and I have adult acne.  </li>
<li> for any moisturizer you have to be careful to not put on so much because your face will get oily.</li>
<li> I do not have sensitive skin and only experience a cooling sensation after applying.  </li>
<li> I have been using this Dual action moisturizer for the last 2 years every day and it works well.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
<li> I highly recommend this to anyone who has oily (or dry) skin and needs a product that won&#x27;t make it even oilier.</li>
<li> To make that search all the more difficult, I am incredibly SENSITIVE skin...</li>
<li> After I wash my face, I put a thin layer of this only on my cheeks, sometimes my chin where I break out most,</li>
<li> When I first got this I was a little skeptical because I had bought other moisturizers that claimed to make my face feel clean and fresh</li>
<li> Most moisturizers I have used feel heavy on my skin and feel oily and slick.</li>
<li> only has half a percent of salicylic acid, which makes me wonder how it could really be that effective.&lt;br</li>
<li> This product works well as a moisturizer, and soaks into the skin quickly, leaving a soft feeling behind, no grease or residue.</li>
<li> Consistently does its job without being greasy, and a small amount goes a long way.  </li>
<li> Now that I&#x27;m older, this is too harsh for me.</li>
<li> Use something different if your skin is dry and/or prone to moderate or severe acne.</li>
<li> I used this for a few weeks in addition to my normal skincare routine and saw no changes.    </li>
<li> My girlfriend has been using it for the past 3 years, every day, and she has no complaint.</li>
<li> I noticed that when I used it, my skin never really was properly moisturized</li>
<li> After a long time I realized it was this product.</li>
<li> bottle of this lasts me a long time too</li>
<li> So long as they keep making it, I&#x27;m going to keep</li>
<li> The Wal-Mart brand costs less than both the actual product and the Target brand, but is definitely of a lower quality.</li>
<li> I noticed that after about a week of using the other stuff that my skin wasn&#x27;t breaking out and was actually retaining moisture with each use.</li>
<li> To not digress further, I went to my dermatologist and decided not to use Acutane due to the risks, and was put on Monodox \\&quot;as needed\\&quot;.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know the technical term, but I suffer from a vicissitude of extremely dry &amp; extremely oily skin.</li>
<li> I bought this because I have combination oily and dry skin while suffering from acne.</li>
<li> The acne meds dry out my skin.  </li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t use this moisturizer if you&#x27;re looking to take care of dry skin on your face...</li>
<li> but when I do I feel like this product helps reduce the redness and doesn&#x27;t cause dry skin.</li>
<li> at night, I apply Queen Helene&#x27;s Mint Julep mask and let it dry for about 30 minutes.  </li>
<li> so I believe it is this cream is causing my skin to dry out and crease.</li>
<li> Also salicylic acid is known to dry out</li>
<li> I have dry skin as well as oily skin and acne prone skin.</li>
<li> I have really dry skin around my nose</li>
<li> I have combination skin (dry cheeks, oily forehead and chin).</li>
<li> I have combination skin, so my face is oily in spots and dry in others.</li>
<li> It won&#x27;t dry your skin out and won&#x27;t feel slippery or oily after application</li>
<li> now that I am in my mid-30s, I have found that no other product provides the moisture my face needs without it being too heavy, greasy or too</li>
<li> single.</li>
<li> As far as MOISTURIZER, I&#x27;ve been so desperate to find the right moisturizer that would help give me that &#x27;soothing&#x27; feeling versus itching, stinging, or masking my face with oil.</li>
<li> Be aware that it may cause problems and if you begin breaking out worse, don&#x27;t hesitate to discontinue use.</li>
<li> I use other medications prescribed by a dermatologist, so I don&#x27;t know if the interaction with the other creams may have caused the extra break out, or if it was this moisturizer.</li>
<li> I had half a bottle of the advantage moisturizer left one day and decided to use it instead just to use it up.</li>
<li> The skin there usually gets very dry and flaky with the use of acne prodcuts and various other things such as the winter air.</li>
<li> I prefer this over the generic store brands because this formula is a little thicker.  </li>
<li> so I no have masculine complex.  </li>
<li> Overall, I do notice that there are getting less and less bumps on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> My chin and lower half of my cheeks and around my mouth get extremely dry, peel, itch, and</li>
<li> A little goes a long way with this stuff.</li>

<li> will keep this product as a staple moisturizer in my arsenal of face products from now on and will leave those other products alone.</li>
<li> I have combination skin and have been using this daily for the past 2 weeks.</li>
<li> I have combination skin (oily + dry) but my dry skin is usually on my cheeks and my nose, chin, and forehead are where it&#x27;s oily.</li>
<li> I wanted a moisturizer for my noise which gets dry and flaky that wouldn&#x27;t be too heavy and wouldn&#x27;t aggravate my acne.</li>
<li> and I actually broke out way worse while using it than my regular acne.</li>
<li> I used this a long time ago and was obsessed with it, and I swear this was why my skin was clear.</li>
<li> I still break out, and my dark spots don&#x27;t seem to be going anywhere soon.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not a fun combo to work with</li>
<li> It does contain salicylic acid, but only .5 percent which is not a great deal, although if you do suffer from dry skin it can irritate it.</li>
<li> I did suffer from breakouts constantly, but my face has almost cleared after using these products and my usually oil-drenched face, an hour after showering before, no longer shines--I say about an 90% shine reduction!  </li>
<li> This moisturizer won&#x27;t dry out your face and it won&#x27;t cause excessive breakouts.</li>
<li> I feel this cream has, is that it is slightly drying.</li>
<li> With the salicylic acid in it there is less chance of my acne prone skin breaking out from using it</li>
<li> It is lightweight and feels slightly tingly on my face.</li>
<li> I am 14 and have extremely dry skin around my t-zone area, and its hard to apply things like bb cream or foundation, because it just sticks in the flakes of my skin(sorry for graphics).</li>
<li> That 0.5% of salicylic acid is another little pro and improves acne and the hydration in my skin.</li>
<li> It tingles a little after application.</li>
<li> My face is always oily even when I put a little moisturizer on.</li>
<li> i don&#x27;t recommend to nit wash your face at night after you used this product because it can damage your skin a little bet.  </li>
<li> I made the mistake of trying to switch to Aveeno and my face immediately broke out with little pimples everywhere.</li>
<li> Regular use has decreased the amount of oil my skin is producing, so I have breakouts less often.</li>
<li> this lotion missing sun block.  </li>
<li> and I can use, does not have the feel like you heavy or greasy on your face.</li>
<li> The generic seems a bit watery or thin, if that makes any sense.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few regimens and products.  </li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or burdensome.</li>
<li> I use the product everyday at night, after I wash my face, before bed.</li>
<li> As far as the actual product is concerned, my skin ALWAYS dries out really bad with the usual acne product which causes acne spots, redness, and  peeling of the skin.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t use Steps 1 &amp; 2, I just wash my face with plain soap and what then moisturize with this product</li>
<li> also has scent but not strong.  </li>
<li> This, however, did tame the acne.</li>
<li> I still get a little oily after a few hours but nothing like I&#x27;ve suffered with for the past 15 years!</li>
<li> It reduced it to a small amount and kept it there, but I had to use it every day</li>
<li> My son has been struggling with breakouts for the past year.  </li>
<li> I am not sure</li>
<li> not satisfied.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t usually suffer from severe acne</li>
<li> Before bed I usually wash my face and then put on moisturizer.</li>
<li> On the plus side, my forehead is no longer an oil slick...</li>
<li> I usually brake out on my chin/jaw and in between my eyebrows/forehead</li>
<li> It&#x27;s really hard on your skin.</li>
<li> so my complexion doesn&#x27;t get dull</li>
<li> and I can now use a moisturizer to help ward off breakouts from having to use acne wash at least 2x a day.  </li>
<li> The only relief was to rinse my burning face in cold water and throw away</li>
<li> If it stung, it would end up itching after a while, and hence make my condition worse, not better.</li>
<li> I was in serious need of moisturizer for my face and this just happened to be on sale.</li>
<li> I break out on a regular basis once a month it gets really bad.</li>
<li> I hate this product and would not recommend this to somebody who has acne-prone, sensitive, oily skin.&lt;br</li>
<li> I needed a moisturizer that wouldn&#x27;t make my acne worse, and preferably, would help prevent acne.  </li>
<li> made issue worse</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t contain a sunscreen, for one, so it&#x27;s not great for the daytime.</li>
<li> After using once a day, my forehead, chin and cheeks have broken out.</li>
<li> I never really had very bad acne, just a few bumps here and there.</li>
<li> I hardly get breakouts and never got a bad reaction when using this product.</li>
<li> you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
<li> Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be using that stuff anymore.</li>
<li> I feel dirty and pores clog.  </li>
<li> If they ever discontinue this product i&#x27;ll be very sad.</li>
<li> My acne was fairly bad before I bought this product.</li>
<li> When I&#x27;m breaking out badly, I take one for 2-3 days consecutively and then stop for about a week and repeat the process.</li>
<li> Which isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
<li> As the title says, it broke me out really bad.</li>
<li> it is so bad</li>
<li> I used this product in order to moisturize without having to worry about break-outs and I was disappointed.</li>
<li> I use it after showering, allow it to sink into my skin for about 10-15 minutes and then apply a base, then foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> My Skin was in horrible shape after I used this..</li>
<li> My boyfriend has terrible breakouts and this helped a lot</li>
<li> but it irritated my skin awfully</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> ok i use this for long time now. but i buy at drug store before and pay over $7.  i get this cheap now on Amazon.  makes face feel tingly fresh.  no heavy or greasy so I keep on my face.  other lotion I feel dirty and pores clog.  this lotion missing sun block.  me no likey that. Also I pump three times for full face lotion cover.  I like to include neck too because old people neck sag. maybe lotion will prevent.  also has scent but not strong.  so I no have masculine complex.  I see difference when I lotion regularly.  younger looking skin on my already young looking man face.  Lady can use too.  I no think J&amp;J discriminates.</li>
    <li> My acne was fairly bad before I bought this product. I actually bought it on sale from Ulta originally, but I am now at a seasonal job in the boonies which requires me to make my orders online. It&#x27;s cheaper here on Amazon than at Ulta, and the shipping is at most  day late.     As far as the actual product is concerned, my skin ALWAYS dries out really bad with the usual acne product which causes acne spots, redness, and  peeling of the skin. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a litte over a year now, and it has dramatically reduced all of these symptoms.. Overall I feel this product is worth the money and effort. Way to go, Clean and Clear!</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion since I was in High School and am now 33.  I only use it at night, as it does not contain sunscreen.  It goes on smoothly and absorbs well with absolutely NO greasiness.  It has a cool, tingly feeling that I haven&#x27;t found in any other lotion. I no longer suffer from acne breakouts, but this is an awesome nighttime lotion for me. I know I should probably be using \\&quot;antiaging\\&quot; lotion at this point, but I just can&#x27;t seem to break my addiction to this one!</li>
    <li> johnson&#x27;s &amp; johnson&#x27;s has done it again! i absolutely love this oil free lotion it makes my skin feel smooth and great with or without makeup&lt;br /&gt;i love using after i exfoliate or when im done cleansing after wearing make up&lt;br /&gt;im glad i purchased</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have combination oily and dry skin while suffering from acne. I wanted a moisturizer for my noise which gets dry and flaky that wouldn&#x27;t be too heavy and wouldn&#x27;t aggravate my acne. This product didn&#x27;t help the dryness at all. After reading the back, it actually says it may cause dryness and peeling. It also seemed to aggravate my acne. I use other medications prescribed by a dermatologist, so I don&#x27;t know if the interaction with the other creams may have caused the extra break out, or if it was this moisturizer. Either way, I will not be using this product any longer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizers and most of the time, it would dry up my skin more, or leave it too greasy. Clean and Clear gives it the perfect amount and i don&#x27;t have to use alot as well. Just a pump. Love this moisturizer</li>
    <li> Only moisturizer my mom and I can use, does not have the feel like you heavy or greasy on your face. Very light</li>
    <li> For its price range, it is good enough. If you are looking for premium skin care products, this is not the one for you. But, if you are just a high school/college girl who is looking for an economical moisturizer, this one is pretty good. My girlfriend has been using it for the past 3 years, every day, and she has no complaint. She probably will switch to higher end products though, as she will turn 22 soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: great moisturizer. Makes your skin feel very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;con: does not prevent acne whatsoever but neither does any other brand.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for the last 15 years.  It&#x27;s perfect.  I prefer this over the generic store brands because this formula is a little thicker.  The generic seems a bit watery or thin, if that makes any sense.  I&#x27;ve had no issues with using this under makeup, primers, or even sunscreen.</li>
    <li> A gift for my teen. It was helpful with her complexion. Moisturize and keep a clean face.....you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product daily for over 10 years now. I just hope they don&#x27;t change it. It&#x27;s light, doesn&#x27;t clog the pores, keeps my skin clear, goes on smoothly. When I began using the product there would be a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; sensation on my face. It is normal. The sensation gradually declined, and now I don&#x27;t feel it so much.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer for the oil skin and controls Acne.</li>
    <li> I picked this stuff up thinking it&#x27;d be useful for my dry, acne prone skin. I used it in good faith for a couple of months, though I occasionally skipped it. I noticed that when I used it, my skin never really was properly moisturized and I was still spot touching dry patches of skin with a heavy duty body lotion. I also noticed my skin still kept breaking out. I had half a bottle of the advantage moisturizer left one day and decided to use it instead just to use it up. I noticed that after about a week of using the other stuff that my skin wasn&#x27;t breaking out and was actually retaining moisture with each use. Then, I was reading the back of the dual action bottled when I found a statement that it MAY cause dryness! A moisturizer that dries your skin out? Where&#x27;s the logic in that? Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be using that stuff anymore. I might be good for someone who has only occasional, light acne along with oily skin, but for those of us with moderate acne and dry skin? This stuff is a joke.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is great, it makes my face smooth and it does help with acne. I will continue to purchase it, it is also very affordable which makes it even better.  It makes my makeup look fresh and it goes on smoothly.</li>
    <li> One of the more effective treatments I&#x27;ve found for my acne prone skin.  I now wash with Neutrogena Body Clear Body Wash with salicylic acid, and then use this.  I especially like to use this before bed.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from Wal-Mart after finding it on the internet and went through the entire bottle. It should be mentioned that not all products will do what they say for everyone. For me, this did not moisturize, nor did this prevent acne. This, however, did tame the acne. It reduced it to a small amount and kept it there, but I had to use it every day otherwise the acne would come back stronger. That is all it did though, so for me personally, it&#x27;s not something I will try again. It may work for you, but it really just didn&#x27;t do what it claims.</li>
    <li> I am a male and I have adult acne.  The acne meds dry out my skin.  I needed a moisturizer that wouldn&#x27;t make my acne worse, and preferably, would help prevent acne.  This product fits the bill.  It is light, cooling, and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.  It&#x27;s gentle enough that I can put it on my face right after shaving, and it doesn&#x27;t sting or burn.  (It actually works really well as an after-shave conditioner; seems to help prevent red bumps and ingrown hairs!)  The only way this product could be better would be if they added sun protection to it.  I hope someday they make a version of this with SPF 15; if they do, I will give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years. Smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have severe huge white-head acne, but do have moderate acne where my face is pack-full of bumps everywhere. I have tried every. single. lotion/acne-clearer possibly available on the market from the time I was 13 (I am now 22). To make that search all the more difficult, I am incredibly SENSITIVE skin... the kind where I have to be careful to wash my bedsheets with odor-free detergent. Sometimes when putting on shirts (that I wash with a nicely scented detergent) if it touches the side of my face it begins to itch and then I have an allergic reaction in that very spot. I am *that* sensitive. Hence, most of the \\&quot;Guaranteed\\&quot; products out there made me face swell up like a red water-balloon literally (Proactiv).  I don&#x27;t know the technical term, but I suffer from a vicissitude of extremely dry &amp; extremely oily skin. My chin and lower half of my cheeks and around my mouth get extremely dry, peel, itch, and then if I itch form red spots, etc. I stress all this as I find it EXTREMELY important when giving this product the review I&#x27;m going to give it.  To not digress further, I went to my dermatologist and decided not to use Acutane due to the risks, and was put on Monodox \\&quot;as needed\\&quot;. When I&#x27;m breaking out badly, I take one for 2-3 days consecutively and then stop for about a week and repeat the process. So, this is my explanation to explain my acne condition.  As far as MOISTURIZER, I&#x27;ve been so desperate to find the right moisturizer that would help give me that &#x27;soothing&#x27; feeling versus itching, stinging, or masking my face with oil. If it stung, it would end up itching after a while, and hence make my condition worse, not better. If it simply felt like a &#x27;masked&#x27; feeling in the face, then it simply did absolutely nothing for me and didn&#x27;t help the dryness at all.  This is the ONE and ONLY topical product I have ever used that&#x27;s helped me. Not only have I found the absolute perfect moisterizer, but for my personal skin condition, it truly does all it states. I *LOVE* the tingly clean feeling! It&#x27;s like having mint on your face and walking outside on a cool, crisp morning. It has 0 oil. None. I leave it on for hours and it&#x27;s perfect. The best thing is that it somehow doesn&#x27;t irritate my capricious face. I was fed up with my face and bought this on a whim. For the first time in my life, I reached for the save.  I wish I could give it more than just 5 stars.  Very happy customer!</li>
    <li> My son has been struggling with breakouts for the past year.  He has tried a number of moisturizers with no luck.  They either cause him to break out, leave his face feeling greasy, or offer no SPF protection.  This is the one moisturizer that works, and that is important because his acne medications can often leave his face dry and irritated. This product has become so essential to him that we order through subscribe and save to make sure he doesn&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> I like putting on face lotion before I put my makeup on. This lotion just doesn&#x27;t feel like it even moisturizes your face ): stopped using after one use</li>
    <li> Pretty nice feel to use it, good effect on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it&#x27;s every penny of the price, and I&#x27;m looking forward to more such products.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use this moisturizer if you&#x27;re looking to take care of dry skin on your face... the only thing it is good for is if you want to put a moisturizer on before makeup.  In no way does it \\&quot;Moisturize all day long\\&quot; like the bottle says.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it. It keeps my skin feeling fresh and moisturized after I use my facewash cleanser that often makes my skin dry. Great and not oily at all. That 0.5% of salicylic acid is another little pro and improves acne and the hydration in my skin.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin (oily + dry) but my dry skin is usually on my cheeks and my nose, chin, and forehead are where it&#x27;s oily. I use this product with a face wash I bought the same time as this one called L&#x27;Oreal Paris Go 360 Anti-Breakout Facial Cleanser. I knew I needed a moisturizer because the one I used to use made my skin so oily and shinny. After I wash my face, I put a thin layer of this only on my cheeks, sometimes my chin where I break out most, and under my nose. Surprisingly, this stuff doesn&#x27;t make my face oily or dry and helps alongside my face wash. I barely use any of this every morning and night so for the price and size, this will last me a long time. I&#x27;m glad I finally found a moisturizer which really is oil-free although I wouldn&#x27;t use it on my nose (my most oiliest spot) but it works great everywhere else. Finally I&#x27;ve found a Clean &amp; Clear product that works great for me! I highly recommend this to anyone who has oily (or dry) skin and needs a product that won&#x27;t make it even oilier.</li>
    <li> I used this item for the 1st time today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It went on nicely but actually made my skin feel dry and my face is burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  put it on about 10 mins ago and its still burning. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning this item.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple of weeks and i like it so far. It tingles a little after application. It is good for oily skin and summertime. I would need something much stronger for winter. I also really like the packaging.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over a week now and I&#x27;ve noticed a decrease in my back/shoulder and chest acne. I use stronger stuff for my face like topical creams, but when I use topical creams on my body, it&#x27;s too drying. This Clean and Clear moisturizer is perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion since I was a young teenager. I am now 24 and I&#x27;ve used it every day since. It gives your skin a nice fresh tingly sensation upon application. I rarley get zits but when I do I feel like this product helps reduce the redness and doesn&#x27;t cause dry skin. I use this daily for moisture and pimple control. If they ever discontinue this product i&#x27;ll be very sad. Love this!</li>
    <li> I have lived off this moisturizer for YEARS. Perfect to keep my skin from flaking and yet not oily at all.</li>
    <li> for any moisturizer you have to be careful to not put on so much because your face will get oily. But I must say overall, I love this product. I have been using it for years now, and it works every-time. I can definitely tell a difference by just using it just once. My face looks brighter and the tone is more evened out. This product is extremely recommended to those with sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Been using this for 15 years. At this point, my skin might be &amp;#34;addicted&amp;#34; to it and I am too scared to try something else, but not complaining. Best for semi-oily skin that is prone to mild acne.</li>
    <li> Just picked up this product from my local Walmart, I believe this product cost under or if not $6.00. Which isn&#x27;t bad at all. I use this product after cleaning my face every morning and every night. It leaves my face feeling fresh and light weight. It&#x27;s also an oil free product which is great for combination skin and oily skin. If you have combination or oily skin I strongly recommend you use oil free products like this. It&#x27;s safe for daily use as well. It also has in proved my face. I hardly get breakouts and never got a bad reaction when using this product. It helps my face stay clean and clear of acne. I also recommend you to go to your local Walmart or drugstore as it is cheaper to buy in store&#x27;s then online.</li>
    <li> I normally buy this product from Target, but I was out and had a very hectic week, so I ordered this with my amazon prime.  No problems with quality of product, but I believe I can get it for cheaper somewhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this lotion because it is very light.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling too greasy like a lot of facial moisturizers.  It also smells nice and has a very slight cooling effect.  I am not sure how effective this alone would be at helping with breakouts, but I love how light it is.</li>
    <li> not satisfied. didn&#x27;t seem to help. made issue worse</li>
    <li> Seems to rub in well but after about an hour or two my face is greasy all over. After a long time I realized it was this product. I gave it away.</li>
    <li> Note: I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 weeks+, so I could be sure of the results. I suggest buying this product in BULK. I am 14 and have extremely dry skin around my t-zone area, and its hard to apply things like bb cream or foundation, because it just sticks in the flakes of my skin(sorry for graphics). This moisturizer smoothens and hydrates my skin all day, really! I got this product at Walgreens, and I had a 2 dollar coupon so the price was a bit cheaper, but it&#x27;s better(and higher quality) than all of those expensive, Sephora-brand kinds. Also, there is the claim that it &amp;#34;treats and prevents pimples&amp;#34;, which is partially true. I have pretty clear skin, so this is very good for just overall red or bumpy skin. I think when people say it&#x27;s not a valid acne medication is when they have that one, big pimple which may just need time. Additionally, it&#x27;s oil-free, so it seeps in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy look/residue. I wish I had bought a million more! (Maybe I will..)</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING! I have super oily/acne prone skin and have been looking for a setting moisturizer to put on after cleansing and before makeup. I did my research and found this product. I immediately went out to Target and bought it (at a super affordable price). The first time I used it, it gave my face a cool tingly sensation that I LOVE because it feels so refreshing and clean. I find myself putting this product on my face all the time just to feel that refreshing, cool sensation. Another great thing about this product is how lightweight it is. Most moisturizers I have used feel heavy on my skin and feel oily and slick. This one sinks right into your skin, drying very quickly, leaving you with a soft, smooth feeling. I used to break out all the time when I used makeup, but now when I use this before, I NEVER breakout. It acts as a shield to protect your skin from acne. It does not clog pores at all, nor does it make your face look shiny. It gives your face just the right about of moisture it needs to control oil production, while leaving you feeling refreshed and clean. 5 Stars and a must buy!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product off and on since my 20s and have always come back to it. IDK why I keep thinking there is a better moisturizer out there that won&#x27;t break my face out like this one. I have tried many different moisturizers, from the ridiculously expensive to the dirt cheap and this is the product that has consistently delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even now that I am in my mid-30s, I have found that no other product provides the moisture my face needs without it being too heavy, greasy or too light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep this product as a staple moisturizer in my arsenal of face products from now on and will leave those other products alone.</li>
    <li> this moisturizer is amazing.. it never make my face oily but it moisturize it is a perfect way that I can use my primer and foundation without having oily spots on my nose or chin... go go go</li>
    <li> This does not make my skin feel greasy. It absorbs very quickly and has helped my skin so much. Since I have been using this I don&#x27;t have any cystic acne which is a major plus.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and cheaper than in the store</li>
    <li> First of all, this a moisturizer with salicyclic acid.  It does not say it is for sensitive skin.  It is not a toner nor a cleanser! I am 52 and this lotion has worked wonders on my stubborn blackheads and milia.  I use it in conjunction with Acne Free benzoyl peroxide cleanser and Clean &amp; Clear rapid acne pads 2x daily.  I do not have sensitive skin and only experience a cooling sensation after applying.  This lotion provides great moisturization without breakouts or stickyness.</li>
    <li> Using it with Clearasil cleansing pads! Much better than proactive. Saves money and better quality than proactive moisturizer!</li>
    <li> Before this moisturizer I was easily pimple prone and oily faced. I was looking for something to help both of those things and I found it! I absolutely love this moisturizer. It keeps my face pimple free and very soft but not overly oily. It smells great, is lightweight, and is overall just a great moisturizer. However, I don&#x27;t think that it has SPF or anything like that</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m twenty nine and have always had acne and very oily skin.  I&#x27;ve tried quite a few regimens and products.  This moisturizer works really good for me.  Two  or three times a week, at night, I apply Queen Helene&#x27;s Mint Julep mask and let it dry for about 30 minutes.  I then wash it off or sometimes use an electric toothbrush (not the one for my teeth!!) and use it to gently massage my face as I wash off the mask with cool water.  I then use this moisturizer every night after washing or using this mask.  In the morning, I wake up, wash my face with warm water and apply some more of this moisturizer.  I did suffer from breakouts constantly, but my face has almost cleared after using these products and my usually oil-drenched face, an hour after showering before, no longer shines--I say about an 90% shine reduction!  I still get a little oily after a few hours but nothing like I&#x27;ve suffered with for the past 15 years! This has helped me feel so much better about myself and less self-conscious when talking to people. Also, along with this, I have been drinking 1 or 2 Emergen-C Vitamin C Acai each day, along with just lots of water throughout the day.  I have always been an avid consumer of water, but I&#x27;ve added the vitamin C recently, which I&#x27;ve heard is really good for your skin. Everything is just working together. This regimen is great and works wonders for my skin! I have finally found just what I needed! I hope others will have the same experience! I got most these products at Walmart and Walgreens. Peace.</li>
    <li> awesome product, i have been using this for nearly 14 years and this gets great results. Non oily helps with light acme and is very refreshing.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this mosturizer. I am a big fan of Clean &amp; Clear products. It feels light on the face and works well on combination skin types. It also has a nice, clean smell to it. You don&#x27;t have to apply a whole lot of it on. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It&#x27;s perfect for keeping my face soft and smooth, without breaking out. I especially like to use it at night.</li>
    <li> I have an oily t- zone...NO lotion has ever worked in treating it (and I have tried MANY different matte lotions) Now having this lotion, I only have very little oil on my nose area but I still see a major difference in my skin compared to before and i am 99.9% satisfied with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s.This stuff feels like Amazing silk going on the skin.!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Thanks Clean-and-Clear!</li>
    <li> I used this a long time ago and was obsessed with it, and I swear this was why my skin was clear. However, I may have just been very diligent with my skin care.&lt;br /&gt;This only has half a percent of salicylic acid, which makes me wonder how it could really be that effective.&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I have strayed away from a product that can do it all. I am fine with a basic moisturizer, face wash, and nightly AHA treatment, as well has an occasional BHA treatment for when I do get acne.</li>
    <li> I thought this is moisturizer like you apply on your face after washing your face to prevent peeling. but instead, I have more peeling after I applied this on my face.</li>
    <li> I purchased this moisturizer because I was looking for something that would keep my skin hydrated while also treating my acne. I&#x27;m afraid this wasn&#x27;t the best product for me to choose, however. It doesn&#x27;t contain a sunscreen, for one, so it&#x27;s not great for the daytime. It does contain salicylic acid, but only .5 percent which is not a great deal, although if you do suffer from dry skin it can irritate it. I have pretty oily skin so that isn&#x27;t a problem for me, but I also struggle with moderate adult acne and don&#x27;t feel this is strong enough to really take care of it. I used this for a few weeks in addition to my normal skincare routine and saw no changes.    The lotion goes on clear and dispenses from a pump top for easy application. You get a full 4 ounces for the price.    I would say this product would be great for someone who breaks out with light acne very occasionally, and who is looking for a *nighttime* moisturizer for the oily areas of the face. Use something different if your skin is dry and/or prone to moderate or severe acne.</li>
    <li> I like my CoQ10 from Nivea, but this stuff definitely does the trick as well.  Finish up that shave, get a nice hot towel on your face, and finish up with a dab of this stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different moisturizers and creams- this one is the best. It&#x27;s got a medicated tingle when you put in on your face. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or burdensome.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and have been using this daily for the past 2 weeks. However, there hasn&#x27;t been any noticeable difference on my skin. I still break out, and my dark spots don&#x27;t seem to be going anywhere soon. It moisturizes okay (nothing special), but in terms of treating pimples, this dual-action product leaves its promise unfulfilled.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years.It is a perfect moisturizer if you are prone to breakouts, no matter what your age. It is light and absorbs well.  I am 58, and I would not be without it!</li>
    <li> When I first got this I was a little skeptical because I had bought other moisturizers that claimed to make my face feel clean and fresh but, it would end up being sticky and greasy feeling. This product does the opposite. I would wash my face and put this on afterwards and my face just felt so clean and tingly. It didn&#x27;t burn and after my skin would absorb it, it wasn&#x27;t greasy! When I run out I will buy another bottle. Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I use this moisturizer with my Clinique acne solutions clearing moisturizer. It works really great for my moderate acne. I love it!! I use daily in the morning n night.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually suffer from severe acne but I occasionally get a spot or two one my face but recently, I got a cluster of bumps on my forehead and decided to try out this cream to see if it would help reduce them (since it does contain salicylic acid). Overall, I do notice that there are getting less and less bumps on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only disadvantage I feel this cream has, is that it is slightly drying. This is because after using it on a regular basis on my forehead, I&#x27;ve noticed that now when I raise my eyebrows, I have several creases on my forehead that never use to exist there before I started using this cream. When I switch back to using a different moisturizer on my forehead, the lines/creases aren&#x27;t there when I raise my eyebrows so I believe it is this cream is causing my skin to dry out and crease. Also salicylic acid is known to dry out skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product because it does help, but I would suggest using another moisturizer after applying this cream to help keep your skin in a good condition.</li>
    <li> This facial moisturizer definitely leaves my skin feeling fresh and smooth. I love how lite weight the formula is and I have noticed my akin clearing up! Very good lotion for people with acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer while helping acne. Love it!  Good price too.</li>
    <li> It has sylisic Acid in it..It&#x27;s really hard on your skin. My Skin was in horrible shape after I used this..</li>
    <li> I was in serious need of moisturizer for my face and this just happened to be on sale. I break out on a regular basis once a month it gets really bad. This product isperfect for both! It leaves a nice tingly feeling on the skin (refreshing not at all burning.)It does not have sunscreen in it, but sunscreen is  skin protectant and this is a MOISTURIZER. If your face is brutally dry I would go with somthing a bit heavier as this is light, totally worth the money. I actually look forward to washing my face at the end of the day just so i can put it on.</li>
    <li> Feels sticky on my skin until it dries. However, my breakouts have reduced since I&#x27;ve been using it. I don&#x27;t use Steps 1 &amp; 2, I just wash my face with plain soap and what then moisturize with this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and am very satisfied with it.  I would recommend it to others as well.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is really good. It&#x27;s just enough to keep zits at bay and aid in healing the ones that you already may have. It can dry out your skin if you use it too often, but once a day is perfect for this product.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin but this doesn&#x27;t make it extra oily or even extra shiny.  With the salicylic acid in it there is less chance of my acne prone skin breaking out from using it and I can now use a moisturizer to help ward off breakouts from having to use acne wash at least 2x a day.  I have had no problems with burning or anything like that but I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.  I am so happy I found this stuff to begin with and even happier I found it as subscribe and save on Amazon because sometimes it is really hard to find in the stores.</li>
    <li> Works nicely as a moisturizer. Mild scented and leaves you with a clean fresh feeling face.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin as well as oily skin and acne prone skin. It&#x27;s not a fun combo to work with but this moisturizer sure helps!</li>
    <li> I almost never had acne when I was in my teens. Mine didn&#x27;t start until I was in my early/mid twenties. I went to the dermatologist then and my dermatologist recommended this lotion along with a soap with Salicylic Acid in it to help keep my skin clear. I&#x27;ve used both now for 20+ years and I rarely have break outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin for the most part so I almost never experience any drying from this lotion and since I&#x27;m now in my forties, I use something else around my eyes and for my neck but this works great for my face. I use it after showering, allow it to sink into my skin for about 10-15 minutes and then apply a base, then foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seems like it keeps my skin bright as well as clear so my complexion doesn&#x27;t get dull and it doesn&#x27;t add shiny-ness to my face. In the winter, I sometimes supplement this lotion with something a bit more moisturizing but this is my primary face lotion for the rest of the year. It doesn&#x27;t make me greasy and leaves my skin soft. I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it because I&#x27;ve tried switching to more expensive brands but either they don&#x27;t work as well or eventually my skin begins to break out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bottle of this lasts me a long time too so it&#x27;s very inexpensive to use. It&#x27;s a must have in my beauty routine. So long as they keep making it, I&#x27;m going to keep buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing: If you get breakouts on your back or shoulders or chest, this works great for those areas as well. Apply it, let it \\&quot;soak in\\&quot; for 10-15 minutes then apply a good sunscreen if you&#x27;re going to be out in the sun for any length of time.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin, and I mainly break out in my t-zone. The skin there usually gets very dry and flaky with the use of acne prodcuts and various other things such as the winter air. I used this product in order to moisturize without having to worry about break-outs and I was disappointed. The product did not really moisturize my face for more than 10 minutes. I find the clinque lotion far better to moisturize and this is allergly tested and totally fragrance free and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pore</li>
    <li> This product is great for winter days when I need that extra moisture for dry skin without adding oil. It is lightweight and feels slightly tingly on my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a decade now. I&#x27;ve tried others. This soaks in easily and isn&#x27;t greasy. It&#x27;s nice to have that little bit of anti-acne stuff in the product, but I&#x27;d use this even without that ingredient. I have oily skin and it seems to go well in the different environments I&#x27;ve lived in.</li>
    <li> My face is always oily even when I put a little moisturizer on. So I&#x27;ve been looking for a cheap oil free moisturizer. I&#x27;ve came across aveeno oil free moisturizer but it&#x27;s ok, then I came across this wonderful product. Like when I put it on my face I feel it working, it makes my face look &amp; feel smooth I love it &amp; it smells good &amp; NO MORE OILY SKIN when it&#x27;s on my face. I will be continue buying this amazing product. I have combination skin.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend has terrible breakouts and this helped a lot</li>
    <li> Its fine, as long as you don&#x27;t use another product with it. Before bed I usually wash my face and then put on moisturizer. But my cleanser isn&#x27;t from Clean &amp; Clear. Its from Olay. Even if I wait an hour after washing my face and then try this moisturizer, I still get a burning sensation on my face. I don&#x27;t break out or get red, but it burnes for a while afterwards. I suppose you have to use the Clean &amp; Clear cleanser if you don&#x27;t want a reaction afterwards. I&#x27;m not going to give up my Olay cleanser, so I won&#x27;t be using this product anymore.</li>
    <li> I used this when I was a teenager to keep my skin clear. I never really had very bad acne, just a few bumps here and there. This really helped keep it under control. Luckily when I reached my early twenties my breakouts became only bothersome once monthly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this with the Morning Burst products and the Blackhead Clearing products from Clean &amp; Clear. I mostly used this at night and used the Morning Burst with spf moisturizer in the daytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using this, my skin was squeaky clean and I was constantly getting compliments. Now that I&#x27;m older, this is too harsh for me. I switched to Olay once acne was no longer a daily concern.</li>
    <li> Clean &amp; Clear&#x27;s Oil-Free Dual Action Moisturizer is an excellent affordable way to keep your face moisturized and under control. I have been using the product for about 10 years now and I can say that it is well worth the money compared to other products on the market. I use it to keep my skin acne-free and under control. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have really dry skin around my nose and I don&#x27;t like to use regular body lotion for my face cuz it breaks my face out. That&#x27;s why I like this product cuz its a moisturizer and a acne product. Works pretty good for the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this over a week ago at target for my combination skin. I break out quite easily on my forehead, and have a few blackheads on my nose. After using once a day, my forehead, chin and cheeks have broken out. And I never break out on my cheeks. On the plus side, my forehead is no longer an oil slick...&lt;br /&gt;I understand that products have to clear out the dirt and oil first, but if this doesn&#x27;t improve in one week, this is going in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/24&lt;br /&gt;Most of the breakouts cleared up with continued use one week after my first review. However, my skin is a bit flaky around my nose. A bit ironic for a moisturizer if you ask me.</li>
    <li> As the title says, it broke me out really bad. I finally had figured out what worked for my skin and had a semi clear face with a pimple or two here and there (that time of the month, stress) but I needed just a bit more of moisture so I decided to try this moisturizer--BIG mistake. I usually brake out on my chin/jaw and in between my eyebrows/forehead so when I woke up the next day I had so many little white in those exact spots. I cannot tell you how upset I was and how itchy my face was. I hate this product and would not recommend this to somebody who has acne-prone, sensitive, oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it a star because I could not give it zero stars!</li>
    <li> i dont know that to write for the review. just wanted to say i love it&#x27;s great. recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way with this stuff. It goes on quick and leaves no residue. This is a great product!</li>
    <li> I been using this for 3 tears now... Work great on my skin and last long. i don&#x27;t recommend to nit wash your face at night after you used this product because it can damage your skin a little bet.  Other than that the smell is good and quality is good</li>
    <li> My skin is pretty acne-prone and dry to begin with so I thought this would be awesome. I don&#x27;t know what about it is so bad but it irritated my skin awfully and I actually broke out way worse while using it than my regular acne. I tossed it in the trash as soon as I realized it was causing the problem and never looked back. Be aware that it may cause problems and if you begin breaking out worse, don&#x27;t hesitate to discontinue use.</li>
    <li> Consistently does its job without being greasy, and a small amount goes a long way.  Definitely earns its brand loyalty.</li>
    <li> i would use it on my face at night after cleansing, and when i wake up the bumps would be almost gone, its a good moisturizer, if only it would get rid of acne scars</li>
    <li> I did not like this. I&#x27;m sensitive to perfumes and the fragrance in this moisturizer was too strong for me.</li>
    <li> This feels clean and non-oily on your skin. It is perfect to use right before applying makeup in the morning.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Dual action moisturizer for the last 2 years every day and it works well.&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer helps keep away blemishes and also has help with redness on my forehead. I use this post shower each day and my face is in very good shape because of it.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I use it every day to prevent acne and it really does work!  I have tried so many different moisturizers and cleansers and have found that this is more effective than any other that I have used, including more expensive names like Clinique and Mary Kay.  Recommend!</li>
    <li> EDIT 6/15/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the moisturizer for several consecutive days, my face became unbearably itchy. The only relief was to rinse my burning face in cold water and throw away the remaining product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/9/13&lt;br /&gt;The lotion absorbs into skin very quickly with no greasy residue. It leaves a bit of a refreshing, tingly sensation when used directly after a shower. I have combination skin (dry cheeks, oily forehead and chin). It made me break out on my forehead after four days of use, but when I stopped applying it to the area, the zits cleared up within two days. I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge improvement in overall acne, but my skin definitely looks fresher and softer. I would absolutely buy this product again</li>
    <li> I have actually never purchased the Clean and Clear product itself, but I have tried both the Wal-Mart brand and the Target brand of this moisturizer. The Target generic brand is AMAZING, I honestly would give it a 5/5! I have combination skin, so my face is oily in spots and dry in others. I use the product everyday at night, after I wash my face, before bed. I would like to think that the acne medication has the best time to absorb into my skin while I&#x27;m sleeping as opposed to wearing it outside in the sunlight, where it would make my face even dryer than normal. In the morning, I use a daytime moisturizer, but that is another review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying the Wal-Mart brand because I left my original bottle at my mom&#x27;s house. The Wal-Mart brand costs less than both the actual product and the Target brand, but is definitely of a lower quality. It&#x27;s a lot more watered down than the Target version and takes several more applications to finally work. I still use it at night, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure the real version of this product works AMAZINGLY WELL since I love the Target version so much. But don&#x27;t buy the Wal-Mart version of this product.</li>
    <li> Like this stuff a lot. Good value, doesn&#x27;t treat breakouts very quickly alone but is great for after astringents and before bed to prevent overnight flare-ups  Cooling with a pleasant mild scent.</li>
    <li> Great for acne. Moisturizes and treats.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my &amp;#34;tweenage&amp;#34; daughter, she says it feels great on her skin.  She is using it in conjunction with the facewash by Clean and Clear.</li>
    <li> My skin is pretty oily naturally and, without moisturizer, gets even moreso. This product works well as a moisturizer, and soaks into the skin quickly, leaving a soft feeling behind, no grease or residue. Regular use has decreased the amount of oil my skin is producing, so I have breakouts less often.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is super light and makes you feel fresh. It did not do wonders to my skin, but it did not make me breakout more.</li>
    <li> Refreshing, excellent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light. It&#x27;s tingly, It absorbs quickly. What more could you ask for? This moisturizer won&#x27;t dry out your face and it won&#x27;t cause excessive breakouts. I made the mistake of trying to switch to Aveeno and my face immediately broke out with little pimples everywhere. I couldn&#x27;t switch back to Clean &amp; Clear fast enough.</li>
    <li> This product is helpful for oily skin that needs moisturizing after cleansing. It won&#x27;t dry your skin out and won&#x27;t feel slippery or oily after application</li>
</ol>
