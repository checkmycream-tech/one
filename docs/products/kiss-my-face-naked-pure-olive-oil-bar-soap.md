      <li>It makes my skin feel so clean and is gentle on my face.</li>

      <li>My face is pretty sensitive and breaks out easily</li>
      <li>: Smells rancid like rubber tires Does not lather very much</li>
      <li>Now that I think about it, I will buy more at the current price.</li>
      <li>bought these for Christmas from the local natural food store for all the girls in the family, they love it as well!</li>
      <li>I purchased this item as an add onto an order where I needed a few more dollars for free shipping.  </li>
      <li>so i&#x27;m hoping I will br writing nice things in the near future!</li>
      <li>I cut these large bars with a kitchen knife and bring them anytime we travel.</li>
      <li>I e-mailed Smart Beauty</li>
      <li>I was tempted to buy two just in case but its so large I will have it for awhile.</li>
      <li>As a guy who really looks into what I put on my face, I bought this on a whim.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>

      <li>Thanks Kiss My Face.</li>
      <li>I order this soap for my whole family to use.</li>

      <li>also made great secret santa gift at work.</li>
      <li>It burned worse than anything I&#x27;ve ever experienced.  </li>
      <li>Long lasting, smells natural, leaves skin feeling nice.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the most disgustingly messy thing</li>
      <li>The main thing i noticed is how SOFT my skin feels.</li>
      <li>I have VERY sensitive skin, and I can&#x27;t even use soap with a wash cloth, because I will itch when I get out of the shower if I do.  </li>
      <li>I developed bruises on my body from the uncontrollable itch, I could not get any relief!</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin, I would not purchase this soap!</li>
      <li>The soap was new for me, it does help clear up the face.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and nourished.</li>
      <li>It is just 3 ingrediants, so it&#x27;s not harsh on your body.</li>
      <li>So far I like it.</li>
      <li>Got this on a recommendation for its natural properties.</li>
      <li>I first found it at a discount store and the single bar lasted 8 months.</li>
      <li>I would recommended, especially for dry skinned people, luckily I dont have that problem.</li>
      <li>The bar itself is extremely large so that it will not fit in a normal soap container.</li>
      <li>cold is really good for you.&lt;br /&gt;Bad</li>
      <li>Love the soap, just don&#x27;t like the green mess it leaves in my soap holder.</li>

<li> Love the soap, just don&#x27;t like the green mess it leaves in my soap holder.</li>
<li> It is extremely moisturizing and pure with only a few natural ingredients.  </li>
<li> I really like how delicate this soap is on my skin.  </li>
<li> I have battled hormonal blemishes for as long as I can remember.</li>
<li> While my blemishes have no completely gone away...</li>
<li> this is the only soap she can use on her face we experimented with other soaps</li>
<li> They are very minimal compared to how big they were before</li>
<li> /&gt;It gets dry and can hurt.&lt;br /&gt;Ask</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t feel like my skin is dry after showering.</li>
<li> No longer so dry.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
<li> The bar also lasts FOREVER; I have been using it everyday now for several months, and it&#x27;s only halfway gone.  </li>
<li> I would only ever purchase this again as some kind of passive aggressive gift for someone I hate.</li>
<li> If I were to buy another I would cut bar in half prior to use.  </li>
<li> After spending an hour in the pool the last thing my skin needs is harsh chemicals.  </li>
<li> Doesnt dry skin and doesnt make it feel tight.</li>
<li> This soap cleans without all the chemicals other soaps use.</li>
<li> It is slightly slimy though.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; soaps for years now and complained to a friend that my skin was still itchy and dry.</li>
<li> It was not until I was rash free for over a month, I reintroduced the kiss my face bar soap, and with in a few hours broke out in the same horrible rash.</li>
<li> This is one of the very few soaps that doesn&#x27;t make me itch.</li>
<li> I seriously thought I&#x27;d have to go to an eye doctor.</li>
<li> I will probably use this soap forever, as it cleans, but it doesn&#x27;t make my skin angry.  </li>
<li> Weirdly I feel like it helped my skin tone or complexion some how too.</li>
<li> , it doesn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s shape at all, it&#x27;s a horrible gooey mess.</li>
<li> Made my skin break out :(</li>
<li> Unfortunately, Kiss My Face bar soap caused me to break out in the worst rash I have ever had.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m writing this post because I don&#x27;t want anyone else to have to suffer like I did :(</li>
<li> break out in my neck from shaving and hate the crap that EDGE or GILETTE or AXE and the others sell us.&lt;br</li>
<li> I genuinely hate this soap.</li>
<li> The worst soap I&#x27;ve ever had the misfortune of using.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it is better than normal bar soap</li>
    <li> Been using it for some time now. Doesnt dry skin and doesnt make it feel tight. No break outs ever since i started using this.</li>
    <li> Made my skin break out :(</li>
    <li> As a guy who really looks into what I put on my face, I bought this on a whim.&lt;br /&gt;Its amazing and really is phenominal.&lt;br /&gt;Im buying it again, probably used the one bar I had over a 2-3 months and its only 1/2 gone.&lt;br /&gt;I break out in my neck from shaving and hate the crap that EDGE or GILETTE or AXE and the others sell us.&lt;br /&gt;It kills my skin.&lt;br /&gt;In the WINTER its even worse.&lt;br /&gt;It gets dry and can hurt.&lt;br /&gt;Ask anyone living in a line above St. Louis.&lt;br /&gt;The cold is really good for you.&lt;br /&gt;Bad soap isnt.&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS GOOD STUFF.</li>
    <li> This soap is just ok; it sort of makes my skin feel a bit like it has a film on it or something, but perhaps I just need to get used to it.  I quit using sulphate soaps, and I use this or Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I really love this soap, and my skin loves it too.  I have VERY sensitive skin, and I can&#x27;t even use soap with a wash cloth, because I will itch when I get out of the shower if I do.  I really like how delicate this soap is on my skin.  I slather my arms and legs in coconut oil after the shower, and my skin has no irritation at all.  I will probably use this soap forever, as it cleans, but it doesn&#x27;t make my skin angry.  The bar also lasts FOREVER; I have been using it everyday now for several months, and it&#x27;s only halfway gone.  Great deal for the money :)</li>
    <li> By comparing this soap to others you can feel how much cleaner you are after you use it. Just try it. This soap cleans without all the chemicals other soaps use.Besides olive oil i believe is good for the skin. You&#x27;ve heard the saying squeaky clean,this is it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Feels totally clean, no yucky chemical perfume smells and no glycerin. Very happy with it. Thanks Kiss My Face.</li>
    <li> Best chemical free soap with lots of suds. I cut these large bars with a kitchen knife and bring them anytime we travel. Love!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!  LOVE IT!  My skin has never felt like this!!&lt;br /&gt;I have always been sensitive to soaps and perfumes, this is the absolute best I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> This product is great. The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is that it&#x27;s bar soap. However, it has helped with my complexion and moisturizing. I&#x27;ve used it for both my face and body. I don&#x27;t feel like my skin is dry after showering.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item as an add onto an order where I needed a few more dollars for free shipping.  I must say that it is one big bar of soap.  I have been using as a body and face soap.  It lathers well.  It is sent free.  Being a man I can&#x27;t say that I notice a difference in my skin.  Maybe in the winter the oil would help with dryness.  If I were to buy another I would cut bar in half prior to use.  Seems like a good value for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bob</li>
    <li> I love this soap... I have battled hormonal blemishes for as long as I can remember. Once I made the switch to this soap (after using Clearasal Acne for yearssssss), my skin has changed for the better. It is brighter and has a glow to it. No longer so dry. While my blemishes have no completely gone away... They are very minimal compared to how big they were before and they go away faster. I still have to figure out what will make them go away for good but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s a diet thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these for Christmas from the local natural food store for all the girls in the family, they love it as well!</li>
    <li> I order this soap for my whole family to use. It leaves my skin feeling soft and nourished. It is just 3 ingrediants, so it&#x27;s not harsh on your body. It has a very mild odor that I can&#x27;t smell after my shower. Which is good. I don&#x27;t like to put all the chemicals included in most soaps all over my face and body. I&#x27;m not sued if most people consider this, but your skin is an organ. Everything you put on your body is absorbed in certain amounts and taken to your liver to clean. I recommend this product to everybody.</li>
    <li> The soap was new for me, it does help clear up the face. I do like how my face oil was maintained once used/</li>
    <li> My grand daughter has very sensitive skin this is the only soap she can use on her face we experimented with other soaps but this was the best for her sensitive skin she loves it as you teenagers have sometimes problem skin problem solved</li>
    <li> I love Kiss My Face olive oil soap and have used it for several years.  It is extremely moisturizing and pure with only a few natural ingredients.  When I received the soap, I realized it was not the size that I had ordered.  I e-mailed Smart Beauty and they were very quick to correct the error and fix the problem.  Thanks for the great customer service!  Would not hesitate to order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I think this is a nice product. Long lasting, smells natural, leaves skin feeling nice.</li>
    <li> After spending an hour in the pool the last thing my skin needs is harsh chemicals.  I use it on my face too.  It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
    <li> I just got done using this soap. So far I like it. The main thing i noticed is how SOFT my skin feels. It&#x27;s like SILK. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of complaints about the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. It&#x27;s not too overpowering. It is slightly slimy though. I would recommended, especially for dry skinned people, luckily I dont have that problem. I love organic products so i&#x27;m hoping I will br writing nice things in the near future!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; soaps for years now and complained to a friend that my skin was still itchy and dry. She recommended this Olive Oil soap, so I ordered some. YAY! What a difference! I&#x27;ll never go back to Dove or Oil of Olay. My skin is happy.</li>
    <li> I am getting ready to order more.  I love this soap.</li>
    <li> I was really worried about this soap making my face oily or causing breakouts buy to my surprise it did not. My face is pretty sensitive and breaks out easily but this soap is amazing. I would say it perfect for combination skin (which I have) as well as any type. My face feels very nice after washing with this. Weirdly I feel like it helped my skin tone or complexion some how too.</li>
    <li> PROS: Nice big soap  CONS: Smells rancid like rubber tires Does not lather very much</li>
    <li> This  bar of soap rinses clean and it is the size of that box too. One might was the three 4 OZ bars instead.&lt;br /&gt;It also made great secret santa gift at work.</li>
    <li> Love it.  It&#x27;s much bigger than it appears in image.</li>
    <li> Kiss My Face Bar Soap smells good and makes my skin feel refreshed compared to other soap brands.</li>
    <li> It saddens me to write this review as I strongly support natural products. I purchased this bar soap from whole foods, as I do most of my beauty supplies. I use Kiss My Face body lotion and have had no problems. Unfortunately, Kiss My Face bar soap caused me to break out in the worst rash I have ever had. I developed bruises on my body from the uncontrollable itch, I could not get any relief! It took me a while to figure out it was my bar soap. I went to my dermatologist multiple times and they misdiagnosed me with scabies!! When that medicine did not work, they had me change my laundry detergent to unscented and switch to dove unscented bar soap. It was not until I was rash free for over a month, I reintroduced the kiss my face bar soap, and with in a few hours broke out in the same horrible rash. If you have sensitive skin, I would not purchase this soap! I&#x27;m writing this post because I don&#x27;t want anyone else to have to suffer like I did :(</li>
    <li> My wife likes this product, not your traditional facial cleanser. So far so good.</li>
    <li> Got this on a recommendation for its natural properties. Love the soap, just don&#x27;t like the green mess it leaves in my soap holder.</li>
    <li> This soap is AWESOME! I first found it at a discount store and the single bar lasted 8 months. I wash my face with it twice per day. Olive oil is the perfect for any skin type. Its nature&#x27;s perfect moisturizer. The bar itself is extremely large so that it will not fit in a normal soap container. I was tempted to buy two just in case but its so large I will have it for awhile. Now that I think about it, I will buy more at the current price. You never know when it might go up in price.</li>
    <li> This is one of the very few soaps that doesn&#x27;t make me itch. It also does not stink, which is nice. Large bar for a good price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing and all natural. It&#x27;s one of my favorite all natural non GMO bar soaps. It makes my skin feel so clean and is gentle on my face.</li>
    <li> Really like this for my face, but whatever you do, don&#x27;t get it in your eyes!!!  It burned worse than anything I&#x27;ve ever experienced.  I seriously thought I&#x27;d have to go to an eye doctor.</li>
    <li> The worst soap I&#x27;ve ever had the misfortune of using. If I could give no stars I would. I genuinely hate this soap. It&#x27;s the most disgustingly messy thing, it doesn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s shape at all, it&#x27;s a horrible gooey mess. If I didn&#x27;t want to avoid wastage I would have thrown it out. We actually had to try periodically freezing it just to make it usable! I would only ever purchase this again as some kind of passive aggressive gift for someone I hate.</li>
    <li> Great&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Healthy and smooth.</li>
</ol>
