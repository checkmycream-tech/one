      <li>good for helping get the stuff out between teeth</li>
      <li>It holds up well and cleans good.  </li>
      <li>This seems to be a good product for a good price.</li>
      <li>And this was a good price for 100yds.</li>
      <li>It is good.</li>
      <li>This was a good buy.</li>
      <li>Good stuff.</li>
      <li>Stocked up two to make sure that I&#x27;m all good for quite awhile.</li>
      <li>I prefer this kind, as it doesn&#x27;t pull apart and shred in my teeth.</li>
      <li>Plus, it is very strong.</li>
      <li>If your teeth are not tightly together, then this is the perfect dental tape for you.  </li>
      <li>Real good floss (tape) better than any other, in my opinion; anyway this stuff works great on my choppers ....</li>
      <li>/&gt;-I thought the dental tape would be wider,however, it is much better than floss as floss tears very easily.</li>
      <li>The J&amp;J dental tape is the best I&#x27;ve found after decades of looking for, and trying out, different brands.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s why I love Dentotape.</li>
      <li>This dentotape is perfect for such a situation.</li>
      <li>I found this wider floss works better for me.</li>
      <li>I,m pleased with the Dentotape in  this packageing.</li>
      <li>The product is fantastic!  </li>
      <li>Glad I bought it here.</li>
      <li>I was pleased to discover that I could order this online.  </li>
      <li>works better for me than floss.</li>
      <li>There is none better.</li>
      <li>Well, Dentotape isn&#x27;t cheap but amazon offers the best price for this product as far as I know.</li>
      <li>This is the original dental tape, which I prefer.  </li>
      <li>I first started buying Johnson &amp; Johnson Dentotape many years ago, the floss resembled a miniature ribbon.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s almost like the clean you get at the dentist office.</li>
      <li>If you have been searching for dental floss that is very strong, highly shred-resistant and frustration-free, this is the one you want.</li>
      <li>The irony is that it ends up costing some of us consumers more to use the cheaper tape because we end up having to use twice as much.</li>
      <li>I ordered two of them because the product is great for tightly packed teeth.  </li>
      <li>I put three nearly full spools of other products in the junk draw, they are good for sewing.</li>
      <li>I find many uses for dental tape outside the oral cavity and am looking for the type of dental tape that used to be available.</li>
      <li>The thinner REACH tape I would rate as about 60% effective as the D1031 tape, as it is too thin to displace plaque effectively</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s probably safe to guess that the big pharmacies quit selling the J&amp;J dental tape because the profit margins aren&#x27;t as fat as they are with cheaper dental tapes.</li>
      <li>Really gets in between your teeth!</li>
      <li>It is ok to recommend but the newer tapes out are wider that you can purchase locally.</li>
      <li>I like it so much...</li>
      <li>It really cleans between the teeth.  </li>
      <li>Works better than other flosses .I</li>
      <li>I culd not find this particular product on any store shelf, but I found it here.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this floss to older folks that have gaps between their teeth.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this brand of dental floss.</li>
      <li>Strong, high quality ribbon floss that does not shred like all other brands I have used.</li>
      <li>I have recommended it highly except for the normal &amp;#34;string&amp;#34; taste.</li>
      <li>The tape is the fibrous type of tape, not the plastic / smooth type.&lt;br /&gt;The yearn that makes up the floss is from the USA, but everything is &amp;#34;processed&amp;#34; in the Dominican Republic.&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely for people with widely spaced teeth.</li>
      <li>Note: The white &amp; purple packaging that is shown in Amazon appears to be the older packaging.</li>
      <li>Hard to find in the stores, so easy to buy this way.  </li>
      <li>I can only buy the tape floss since any other kind won&#x27;t fit between my teeth and since the brand I usually use has been out of stock at Wal-mart for the past couple of weeks, I decided to try this one.</li>
      <li>The new packaging is white with orange trim and has the word REACH in large, black letters on the container.  </li>

<li> I don&#x27;t see where this tape is extra wide</li>
<li> The Reach Dentotape Extra Wide Floss, Waxed was just what I wanted.  </li>
<li> This serves my purpose only after doubling and redoubling it, then twisting it so it can be easily handled--a lengthy and awkward process.</li>
<li> Was hoping for a slightly thicker flat tape.  </li>
<li> It works, but not as wide as the floss I was replacing.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t believe the &amp;#34;tape&amp;#34; part - floss is round and not even flat!</li>
<li> I am a retired dental hygienist  and have had trouble finding the flat dental tape!  </li>
<li> so you can get the floss through your wires and under other appliances.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Use it everyday. Doesn&#x27;t break like regular floss.</li>
    <li> good for helping get the stuff out between teeth</li>
    <li> Not what I wanted. Wanted REACH Ultraclean. Lot #0619D  14:40.  Only think that works for my teeth with caps. HELP</li>
    <li> This is the original dental tape, which I prefer.  It holds up well and cleans good.  It doesn&#x27;t break.  Although it is a tape, there is nothing about tape that is objectionable.  It just doesn&#x27;t have the bad things about thin floss.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s probably safe to guess that the big pharmacies quit selling the J&amp;J dental tape because the profit margins aren&#x27;t as fat as they are with cheaper dental tapes. The irony is that it ends up costing some of us consumers more to use the cheaper tape because we end up having to use twice as much. The J&amp;J dental tape is the best I&#x27;ve found after decades of looking for, and trying out, different brands. What a great surprise it was to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Dentotape is the best floss for people who have to wear braces. Flossing is more of a challenge if you wear braces because the wires make maneuvering difficult. That&#x27;s why I love Dentotape. It is thick and a little \\&quot;stiff\\&quot; so you can get the floss through your wires and under other appliances. No need for plastic threader needles!  It doesn&#x27;t get stuck and makes flossing easier. Well, Dentotape isn&#x27;t cheap but amazon offers the best price for this product as far as I know.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find tape in the stores, just floss.  This seems to be a good product for a good price.</li>
    <li> If your teeth are not tightly together, then this is the perfect dental tape for you.  When my husband had his wisdom teeth removed, it created wider separations for food to get &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34;.  This dentotape is perfect for such a situation.</li>
    <li> Was hoping for a slightly thicker flat tape.  I am a dentist and still nothing compares to the former J&amp;J D1031 waxed Dentotape which J&amp;J in their wisdom have discontinued.  This product needs to be brought back to the market and I have been begging J&amp;J to consider re-introducing it.  The thinner REACH tape I would rate as about 60% effective as the D1031 tape, as it is too thin to displace plaque effectively and I personally find it more uncomfortable to use as the thinner tape can cut like a piano wire.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s extra wide dental tape, what else can I say?</li>
    <li> 1st of all, my name isn&#x27;t fly-specl  -  It is:fly-spec-billie II.  [I just changed it!]&lt;br /&gt;I order this dentotape because it is the best on this planet, &amp; it is unavailable in Pheasant Country, USA (Aberdeen, SD).</li>
    <li> Dentist recommended this floss! Really gets in between your teeth!</li>
    <li> I have used this before and wanted to find some. Dental tape works best for me. And this was a good price for 100yds. I don&#x27;t see where this tape is extra wide but it does the trick for dental hygiene.  I would prefer it being wider as it seems to be the width of string.  Maybe that is why I can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore.  It is ok to recommend but the newer tapes out are wider that you can purchase locally.</li>
    <li> I have very tight contacts between some of my teeth which makes it difficult to floss. Even if I pull the floss tightly and then try to see-saw it between my teeth, the floss would often shred or break.  Sometimes a piece of shredded floss would get stuck between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;When I first started buying Johnson &amp; Johnson Dentotape many years ago, the floss resembled a miniature ribbon. You could see the flat surface on the floss. But lately this floss looks like any other floss. This floss hardly ever shreds. Plus, it is very strong. I no longer have to \\&quot;double fold\\&quot; the floss like I did with other products. Note: The white &amp; purple packaging that is shown in Amazon appears to be the older packaging. The new packaging is white with orange trim and has the word REACH in large, black letters on the container.  If you have been searching for dental floss that is very strong, highly shred-resistant and frustration-free, this is the one you want. Johnson &amp;Johnson \\&quot;REACH\\&quot; Dentotape IS THE BEST. I like it so much...I bought eight of them.</li>
    <li> This floss even though it says DentoTAPE is NOT tape at all. I can only buy the tape floss since any other kind won&#x27;t fit between my teeth and since the brand I usually use has been out of stock at Wal-mart for the past couple of weeks, I decided to try this one. What a waste of money. Never again. Can&#x27;t even get the stuff in between my teeth like I can with the Glide brand of tape floss. Don&#x27;t believe the &amp;#34;tape&amp;#34; part - floss is round and not even flat!</li>
    <li> I will not recommend this to anyone.  I ordered two of them because the product is great for tightly packed teeth.  One of the floss containers didn&#x27;t work.  I contacted the store of which I purchased - no refund or returns if it&#x27;s a manufacturer defect.  If I want to return it, I have to send it back to Johnson and Johnson.  Poor customer service if you don&#x27;t stand behind what you sell.</li>
    <li> I found this wider floss works better for me. The thinner one was leaving stuff behind.</li>
    <li> Extra wide dental tape is hard to find. This really cleans between the teeth and does not break like floss in those narrow gaps.</li>
    <li> what can one say about dentotape??  It is good.</li>
    <li> I,m pleased with the Dentotape in  this packageing.</li>
    <li> my dentist recommended dentotape and I couldn&#x27;t find it in any retail stores. Its tough and doesn&#x27;t shred and fall apart</li>
    <li> The product is fantastic!  It really cleans between the teeth.  It&#x27;s almost like the clean you get at the dentist office.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit narrwoer than other dental tape. But I&#x27;lluse it as opposed to nothing</li>
    <li> IReach Dental Floss&lt;br /&gt;-I thought the dental tape would be wider,however, it is much better than floss as floss tears very easily.</li>
    <li> recommended by dentist 7 years ago. no one locally caries dental tape</li>
    <li> This was a good buy. I use only this dental tape and it works well. Glad I bought it here.</li>
    <li> I am a retired dental hygienist  and have had trouble finding the flat dental tape!  A good find!  Works great!!!</li>
    <li> Prefer unwaxed but can&#x27;t find that anymore.  Have been using Denotape for quite a while.  Was a little confused about this being marketed as &#x27;extra-wide&#x27;.  Seems to be regular Denotape to me.  Denotape is wider than regular floss to begin with, so maybe that is what they are referring to.</li>
    <li> It is getting hard to find dental tape in stores except in off-brands that shred.  I was pleased to discover that I could order this online.  It&#x27;s just what I was looking for, and it couldn&#x27;t have been easier just to order it online and have it delivered to the house.</li>
    <li> It works, but not as wide as the floss I was replacing.</li>
    <li> Real good floss (tape) better than any other, in my opinion; anyway this stuff works great on my choppers .... sammy</li>
    <li> Works better than other flosses .I highly recommend this brand of dental floss.</li>
    <li> works better for me than floss.</li>
    <li> The tape is the fibrous type of tape, not the plastic / smooth type.&lt;br /&gt;The yearn that makes up the floss is from the USA, but everything is &amp;#34;processed&amp;#34; in the Dominican Republic.&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely for people with widely spaced teeth. If you are not sure if your teeth are wide-spaced I&#x27;d say keep looking for something else.</li>
    <li> This possibly could be considered an extra-wide dental floss but scarcely a tape, even for dental use. I find many uses for dental tape outside the oral cavity and am looking for the type of dental tape that used to be available. This is not it. This serves my purpose only after doubling and redoubling it, then twisting it so it can be easily handled--a lengthy and awkward process.</li>
    <li> The Reach Dentotape Extra Wide Floss, Waxed was just what I wanted.  Wish flavoring would be added.  I have recommended it highly except for the normal &amp;#34;string&amp;#34; taste.</li>
    <li> Not carried in the local stores. I&#x27;ve been using for years. There is none better. I put three nearly full spools of other products in the junk draw, they are good for sewing.</li>
    <li> Hard to find in the stores, so easy to buy this way.  I would have preferred not to buy 5 - maybe 2 instead.</li>
    <li> Strong, high quality ribbon floss that does not shred like all other brands I have used. I culd not find this particular product on any store shelf, but I found it here. Shopped Wal~Mart, Osco, CVS, Walgreen&#x27;s and Target, no go. Stocked up two to make sure that I&#x27;m all good for quite awhile.</li>
    <li> Dental TAPE is hard to find in the stores (vs. dental floss). I prefer this kind, as it doesn&#x27;t pull apart and shred in my teeth. EXCELLENT product!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t review this item.  I ordered waxed but received unwaxed which I have already reviewed.  The size for the money however, is a great value.</li>
    <li> I always get the same product.  Very satisfied!!</li>
    <li> Good stuff. I would recommend this floss to older folks that have gaps between their teeth. Its gentler on my gums than regular floss.</li>
