      <li>Wonderful smells but doesn&#x27;t last</li>
      <li>I love the scent (5 Stars), but my review is for this bottle which I did not purchase -</li>
      <li>I do love the smell, but I already knew that before I ordered</li>
      <li>Love the scent, love the size.</li>
      <li>This stuff is so amazing, it smells like spicy sweet candy on my skin.</li>
      <li>I was excited to find this perfume as cheap as I did and couldn&#x27;t wait to receive it the mail because I fell on love with the fragrance at a department store.</li>
      <li>It smelled like warm alcohol, almost like it had gotten hot.</li>
      <li>I smell pretty like a stripper now lmao</li>
      <li>This is nice but VERY samll</li>
      <li>BECAUSE I got it for free as a sample.  </li>
      <li>you can get this for FREE.  </li>
      <li>So far all my Amazon purchases has come in very quickly and in amazing quality.</li>
      <li>Thanks! :)</li>
      <li>My daughter was so excited to get this as part of her stocking suffer.</li>
      <li>I love the smell but would have liked for bottle to be bigger</li>
      <li>I gave the large bottle and love it.  </li>
      <li>i recieved it the other day i love it smell so nice not much to say that its real nice</li>
      <li>I know, I know, I did read the size but in my mind could not truly picture the true size of .24</li>
      <li>I never though it would be so tiny, but I loved the fragrance.</li>
      <li>This was the perfect little set to refill my large bottle a bit.</li>
      <li>Also the seller sent it super quick.</li>
      <li>My new favorite.  </li>
      <li>For the price it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>hardly worth paying the shipping and handling for this tiney squirt  </li>
      <li>I knew right away</li>
      <li>Since it is a very strong fragrance, you only need a drop or two.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the quick shipment.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price for this wonderful smelling perfume,  just a few drops last all day.</li>
      <li>It has a musky strong old smell.</li>
      <li>I hope to e able to get a big bottle of it one day.</li>
      <li>Was exactly as pictured.  </li>
      <li>Seller ships fast!</li>
      <li>I only smelled it recently and it is now my very favorite scent.</li>
      <li>very disappoint</li>
      <li>I really feel like this was a investment of my money.</li>
      <li>My sister got the 1 oz for 75, so it really is what the price is.  </li>
      <li>It would have been worth it to buy a larger size.</li>
      <li>But since 0.5 oz retails for about $45, the price seems about right; however, if you are a regular customer of Sephora, don&#x27;t bother paying for this.</li>
      <li>Although it is QUITE SMALL, I love this fragrance, so I gave it a 5.  </li>
      <li>The little bottle is easy and convient for carrying in your purse.</li>
      <li>My two year old son walked by me after I dabbed it on my wrist and said &amp;#34;that smell</li>
      <li>/&gt;This perfume was shipped in a USPS envelope and the box was completely destroyed.</li>
      <li>I have the real Flowerbomb from Sephora and this is not the same.</li>
      <li>All scents are different, I&#x27;m glad this is a small size.</li>
      <li>SMALL but PRETTY fragrance!</li>
      <li>The bottle is very small, I will wear it on special occasions until I get a bigger bottle</li>

<li> SMALL but PRETTY fragrance!</li>
<li> The bottle is very small, I will wear it on special occasions until I get a bigger bottle</li>
<li> Long lasting and packaged well.</li>
<li> To my disappointment, the perfume in this small bottle did not smell good.</li>
<li> This little bottle will probably last quite a while, because all you need is a tiny drop.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not a pro at ounces, so we were both shocked at the size, but now she has her favorite fragrance.</li>
<li> Was exactly as I expected it to be:  size, smell &amp; the box was intact.</li>
<li> the little bottle had a cap that is not secure at all.the bottle I received is a pulse only .</li>
<li> + s&amp;h was not worth it at all.  </li>
<li> Not worth the money!</li>
<li> Truly, it smells exactly like CK&#x27;s Euphoria, which also smells like one sold at Victoria&#x27;s Secret in a purple bottle (sorry, can&#x27;t remember the name).  </li>
<li> , the bottle is really small</li>
<li> I was using the small size for  travel purposes</li>
<li> I also kept some in the small bottle to take with me on the go.</li>
<li> Bottle size was too small for price.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s rather expensive for a new perfume but as a gift you can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
<li> Its hard to tell is I like the scent</li>
<li> Scent is so watered down it useless</li>
<li> Want to get attention subtly - wear Flowerbomb.</li>
<li> I was really expensive for the little I received.  </li>
<li> the smell.. Smells fake.</li>
<li> IT is EXPENSIVE everywhere, so I got it here for about 20 bucks.  </li>
<li> Needless to say, it has become one of my indulgences as well.  </li>
<li> This stuff stinks.</li>
<li> It is also very expensive to buy from a chain store.</li>
<li> I am disappointed and will not purchase this scent again.  </li>
<li> I gave this as a gift and was rather disappointed with the appearance.</li>
<li> Just Horrible.</li>
<li> Very disappointed! !!!!</li>

    <li> Great smell, the bottle is really small</li>
    <li> I love this perfume!! I only smelled it recently and it is now my very favorite scent. I hope to e able to get a big bottle of it one day. It smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so amazing, it smells like spicy sweet candy on my skin. I also should point out that it stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t rub off.</li>
    <li> Love this smell.  Was exactly as pictured.  Was exactly as I expected it to be:  size, smell &amp; the box was intact.</li>
    <li> My bf said he likes the way this smells. So I decided to get a smaller version of it before committing to a larger one. Thanks for the quick shipment. Awesome!</li>
    <li> IT SMELLS AWESOME. THE HAIR MIST COMPLIMENTS IT  NICELY. I JUST LOVE IT. WOULD BUY IT AGAIN IN A HEARTBEAT, ONLY IN A BIGGER SIZE.</li>
    <li> Scent is so watered down it useless😁very disappoint I gave the large bottle and love it.  I was using the small size for  travel purposes</li>
    <li> This is my favorite &amp;#34;sensual&amp;#34; scent. It is also very expensive to buy from a chain store. Since it is a very strong fragrance, you only need a drop or two. The price and size of this product was perfect for my needs and budget. I will most certianly order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money! I bought this because it&#x27;s been featured in many magazines as the must have award winning fragrance.  I am disappointed and will not purchase this scent again.  Truly, it smells exactly like CK&#x27;s Euphoria, which also smells like one sold at Victoria&#x27;s Secret in a purple bottle (sorry, can&#x27;t remember the name).  So, if your dying to have it, purchase either one of those and tell everyone you&#x27;re wearing Flowerbomb...no one will know the difference.</li>
    <li> $ 25 + s&amp;h was not worth it at all.  A regular bottle costs anywhere form $50 and up.  I  should have just sampled it in stores and purchased the regular bottle.  Its hard to tell is I like the scent bc I can only use it as a splash.  I really feel like this was a investment of my money.</li>
    <li> Best smelling perfume EVER! The little bottle is easy and convient for carrying in your purse. Defineitley will be purchasing more when it runs out.</li>
    <li> This was the perfect little set to refill my large bottle a bit. I also kept some in the small bottle to take with me on the go. Beautiful fragrance! Seller ships fast! Thanks! :)</li>
    <li> 1 the paper scent from my store was delicious. I could not find a scent close with my purChase&lt;br /&gt;2 the little bottle had a cap that is not secure at all.the bottle I received is a pulse only . nospray..&lt;br /&gt;3 I will not seek out this fragrance at store or online</li>
    <li> I know, I know, I did read the size but in my mind could not truly picture the true size of .24 LOL This is nice but VERY samll</li>
    <li> It is an awesome perfume! Love how it stays with you all day!! The scent is perfect for me! Love it!</li>
    <li> OMG The sent is amazing the hubby loved it and was shipped very very fast.The bottle is very small, I will wear it on special occasions until I get a bigger bottle lol!!</li>
    <li> This is an Excellent product.  Such a wonderful scent.  It makes you feel lovely even when it&#x27;s an unlovely kind of day!</li>
    <li> I thought this bottle was a spray bottle when I made the purchase. However when I received it, I discovered the bottle has a screw off lid. I was excited to find this perfume as cheap as I did and couldn&#x27;t wait to receive it the mail because I fell on love with the fragrance at a department store. To my disappointment, the perfume in this small bottle did not smell good. It smelled like warm alcohol, almost like it had gotten hot. My two year old son walked by me after I dabbed it on my wrist and said &amp;#34;that smell yucky mommy!&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I found a coupon for this perfume in my wife&#x27;s car.  I knew right away this was what she wanted for Christmas!  Boy was I right!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this item because people rant and raced about the good scent. All scents are different, I&#x27;m glad this is a small size. For the price it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> packaging was a bit crumpled and flimsy though it did come in the marketed box as pictured. scent didn&#x27;t seem as strong as the ones i&#x27;ve bought at the department store but its still a great perfume and a nice bottle for your purse.</li>
    <li> Bottle size was too small for price. I love the smell but would have liked for bottle to be bigger</li>
    <li> Wonderful smells but doesn&#x27;t last</li>
    <li> Just Horrible. .the price, it&#x27;s too small… the smell.. Smells fake. Very disappointed! !!!!😡😡😡</li>
    <li> not really enough in the bottle.  I was really expensive for the little I received.  I should have purchase the larger bottle</li>
    <li> Good stuff chicks dig it. It&#x27;s rather expensive for a new perfume but as a gift you can&#x27;t go wrong.  Buy it online so you won&#x27;t have to pay California tax.</li>
    <li> I got this for a friend of mine who loves this fragrance. I&#x27;m not a pro at ounces, so we were both shocked at the size, but now she has her favorite fragrance. Also the seller sent it super quick. So far all my Amazon purchases has come in very quickly and in amazing quality.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance! Definitely worth the price. Long lasting and packaged well. Arrived on time. I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I never though it would be so tiny, but I loved the fragrance. It would have been worth it to buy a larger size.</li>
    <li> Although it is QUITE SMALL, I love this fragrance, so I gave it a 5.  IT is EXPENSIVE everywhere, so I got it here for about 20 bucks.  My sister got the 1 oz for 75, so it really is what the price is.  If I could do it again, I&#x27;d spring for the regular perfumes because I feel like I am rationing this.  SMALL but PRETTY fragrance!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price for this wonderful smelling perfume,  just a few drops last all day. This is perfect size to carry in your purse.</li>
    <li> My daughter was so excited to get this as part of her stocking suffer. She loves smelling good. She will be back for ore.</li>
    <li> This perfume is amazingly fragrant without being over-powering.  This little bottle will probably last quite a while, because all you need is a tiny drop.</li>
    <li> My job requires that I meet with the public.  This lady entered by office one day and this heavenly scent wafted in ahead of her.  I had to know what it was.  She informed me that it was Flowerbomb - one of her indulgences.  Needless to say, it has become one of my indulgences as well.  It is a indelible scent.  Want to get attention subtly - wear Flowerbomb.</li>
    <li> My new favorite.  The scent fits me just perfectly.  I have to invest in a larger bottle now.</li>
    <li> i recieved it the other day i love it smell so nice not much to say that its real nice</li>
    <li> I bought this after my husband and I went to a strip club in LA and one of the stripper had us both memorized with the smell. Absolutely amazing. I smell pretty like a stripper now lmao</li>
    <li> It was the correct product and came quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This perfume was shipped in a USPS envelope and the box was completely destroyed. It almost looked used. I gave this as a gift and was rather disappointed with the appearance.</li>
    <li> This stuff stinks. It has a musky strong old smell. With flowers mixed in.  I couldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> I love the scent (5 Stars), but my review is for this bottle which I did not purchase - BECAUSE I got it for free as a sample.  If you accumulate enough points at Sephora (around 200) you can get this for FREE.  I have not seen it being sold anywhere except here, so it makes me wonder...  But since 0.5 oz retails for about $45, the price seems about right; however, if you are a regular customer of Sephora, don&#x27;t bother paying for this.</li>
    <li> I should have noticed the size! 7 ml is the size they hand out for a free sample in department stores!!  hardly worth paying the shipping and handling for this tiney squirt  I do love the smell, but I already knew that before I ordered</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this purchase.  I love the product and feel like I got a good price. Absolutely a good deal.</li>
    <li> Love the scent, love the size. Have wished to purchase this scent for awhile, but did not want to buy a larger amount.  Perfect amount for me, some one who likes a change.</li>
    <li> If i could give it a zero I would. I have the real Flowerbomb from Sephora and this is not the same.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how tiny 7 mL was... this is definitely travel-sized but it&#x27;s very pretty and smells amazing!  I got it for my mom for mother&#x27;s day!</li>
