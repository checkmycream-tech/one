      <li>I heard this is a great product</li>
      <li>lol.</li>
      <li>LOVE the auto-ship since I can&#x27;t find this product anyplace in my area!!</li>
      <li>This toothpaste is very effective at preventing canker sores.  </li>
      <li>Put simply, it&#x27;s very effective at reducing canker sores.</li>
      <li>This is a very nice toothpaste.</li>
      <li>This thing is amazing!</li>
      <li>AMAZING!</li>
      <li>Being able to order from Amazon is great!  </li>
      <li>Buy, it will be pleasant to you.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Rembrandt has a pleasant flavor and seems to do a good job on my teeth.</li>
      <li>It also is fairly inconsistent in its... consistency.  </li>
      <li>it is so good</li>
      <li>I sampled both, and found Rembrandt to be superior in terms of taste and \\&quot;mouth</li>
      <li>It does nothing for your breath and doesn&#x27;t taste good.</li>
      <li>I loved this product when Rembrandt still made it.</li>
      <li>Reduce stress is also a good way to prevent canker sore if you can help it.  </li>
      <li>This tooth paste is not as good as what I used to get.</li>
      <li>But this brand didn&#x27;t do a good job at removing the tarter.</li>
      <li>Super!!!</li>
      <li>I love that Amazon lets me use subscribe &amp; save for this product, but even without it, I still think the price is great.</li>
      <li>Rembrandt better never stop making this!</li>
      <li>I love this toothpaste!</li>
      <li>It cannot be healthy!</li>
      <li>The price is OK for this item!</li>
      <li>Thanx for smooth transactions!!</li>
      <li>and I love the mint flavor it leaves after brushing!</li>
      <li>Love this product but $22.00 per tube is highway robbery!  </li>
      <li>Great product, mild pleasant mint and non-irritating.  </li>
      <li>Very excited to try this toothpaste out after reading all of the reviews!</li>
      <li>This tooth paste is amazing</li>
      <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
      <li>This toothpaste is amazing if you get canker sores.  </li>
      <li>but it cleans effectively.</li>
      <li>We have used this product for over 10 years with great success.</li>
      <li>This toothpaste isn&#x27;t designed to treat canker sores once you get them, but it does a great job preventing them in the first place.</li>
      <li>AT A GOOD PRICE AND QUICK SHIPMENT.</li>
      <li>Also, I&#x27;m fairly sure it doesn&#x27;t do anything to fight plaque or tartar.</li>
      <li>There are some interesting brands out there that would make you think they would work, but read the ingredients.</li>
      <li>I have had monthly canker sores for many, many years.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had more than one canker sore at a time now</li>
      <li>I used to get a couple a month, it almost felt like I had cankers for more days of the year than I didn&#x27;t.      </li>
      <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ordering more today.</li>
      <li>My only complaints with this toothpaste: it isn&#x27;t the best tasting I&#x27;ve ever used; in fact, it&#x27;s quite an acquired taste.  </li>
      <li>I had them every week, often two or more at a time.  </li>
      <li>But it does make your breath better</li>
      <li>I never thought I would be writing a review for toothpaste on Amazon, but I really had to share how great this stuff is.</li>
      <li>I love this toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>I just love to use this paste.</li>
      <li>and I started getting canker sores more often.</li>
      <li>I hope this trend continues :)</li>
      <li>Love that it&#x27;s cheaper and easier to purchase in bulk --</li>
      <li>Love this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I use this all the time and love Amazons bimonthly delivery option.</li>
      <li>I love tomatoes, but get canker sores if I eat more than one.  </li>
      <li>so I was glad to come across it on amazon.</li>
      <li>but if it prevents canker sores then I will repurchase again! :)</li>
      <li>Since I love both apples and pineapples, I decided to buy this toothpaste after reading the favorable reviews.</li>
      <li>I have made a point to brush more there</li>
      <li>and clean&amp;#60;3 i just love this:)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never seen anything have a greater effect on me.</li>
      <li>I am glad I did.</li>
      <li>I just subscribe to this product nowadays to make sure my supply don&#x27;t run out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always loved rembrandt products because they really are effective and do what they promise to do -</li>
      <li>I like the Canker Sore tooth paste much better for canker Sore control</li>
      <li>It sure did for me.</li>
      <li>It would be nice if it was priced better, but it works, and is worth it.</li>
      <li>Perfect for those that have a sensitivity to other brands of paste.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave your mouth feeling like it&#x27;s been power washed with strong chemicals</li>
      <li>I could not use it and do not recommend it, though it&#x27;s not as strong as some toothpastes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s actually pretty amazing.</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s much more satisfying to avoid the problem in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
      <li>The flavor is light and easy on the pallet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>have this toothpaste on auto-order from Amazon and it works just fine.  </li>
      <li>and he&#x27;s been fine ever since.</li>
      <li>My husband has always suffered from canker sores &amp; although we have never found a cure, changing his toothpaste has made a tremendous difference!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m super glad I found it.</li>
      <li>Rembrandt C is SLS and surfactant free.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only toothpaste that is SLS-free with a great taste.</li>
      <li>If anyone has some cheap tubes they want to get rid of, let me know.</li>
      <li>The trick was finding a toothpaste that was free of this suspect ingredient.</li>
      <li>br /&gt;It works, and it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
      <li>guess this product is great for the majority, but I have to review based on my personal experience.</li>
      <li>I am working toward making my life LSL free and this toothpaste is part of that.</li>
      <li>I bought this a couple of days ago and so far so good</li>
      <li>They work just the same at reducing canker sores but I greatly prefer this one in terms of taste, consistency, and perception of how clean it gets my teeth.</li>
      <li>Now only get 1-2 ulcers at a time and very rarely do I get any at all!!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny if it works for you!</li>
      <li>never imagined I&#x27;d be spending over $5 for a tube of toothpaste, but this toothpaste has made the difference for me and it is worth every penny!</li>
      <li>At the first sign of canker sores be sure you are using this tooth paste.  </li>
      <li>My front four top teeth are also bonded and this keeps the tea and coffee stains at bay pretty well without scratching.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got a funny design but gentler, better, and cheaper.</li>
      <li>It leaves your teeth clean and whitens are also others pluses.</li>
      <li>When I&#x27;m not using this, I use a Japanese brand that I love that has a zillion flavors, but every now and again, I try to pierce my own cheek and switch to this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little cheaper, very mild with a fresh taste and equally good!</li>
      <li>Apparently, toothpaste makers found that people who don&#x27;t know any better (most people) think that \\&quot;suds\\&quot; &#x3D; clean.</li>
      <li>The service was great and arrived before expected.</li>
      <li>I have frequent outbreaks of canker sores that don&#x27;t seem to follow any kind of cycle.  </li>
      <li>most of time it&#x27;s not -- I always snatch up as much as I can when I find it).</li>
      <li>I bought it because it&#x27;s supposed to be good for your teeth but only buying 1</li>
      <li>someone who doesn&#x27;t get but maybe one canker sore a month, I don&#x27;t have as much of a need for this product as many of those who purchase it, which may explain why I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in the amount of canker sores I got while using this product.</li>
      <li>Love this gentle alternative to super foamy toothpastes.  </li>
      <li>It is so mild.</li>
      <li>Every couple weeks I&#x27;d have a new breakout of them, sometimes I&#x27;d have as many as 5 or 6.</li>
      <li>I cannot live without this toothpaste any more.</li>
      <li>I am just happy to be putting one less chemical in my body.</li>
      <li>I used to get canker cores very frequently, and often I would have more than one, and sometimes up to five at a time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many things to help alleviate my cankersores, natural remedies like propolis, suplements like L-Lysine, and the normal over the counter things like Anbesol and the like.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping too!!</li>
      <li>With burning mouth syndrome, I am highly sensitive to taste and most toothpastes are much too strong for me, including this one.</li>
      <li>A huge improvement from the days when the pain was intense.)  </li>
      <li>Very upset that this product is no longer available as one of my subscriptions.  </li>
      <li>I researched the problem on my own (web) and found lots of discussion about sodium lauryl sulfate as a possible cause.  </li>
      <li>If you have cankers, this is definitely worth a try for you.</li>
      <li>All I know is that I rarely get canker sores anymore.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s nice to finally have a whitening toothpaste that does not include the SLS ingredient.</li>
      <li>absolutely worth trying.  </li>
      <li>but well worth it.</li>
      <li>It is worth the price and with \\&quot;subscribe and save\\</li>
      <li>but I feel that in full disclosure people would appreciate the first opinion so they know what to expect off the bat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Totally worth it to avoid the pain/annoyance.</li>
      <li>Now I rarely ever get them, and when I do they are never as sore as before.</li>
      <li>I rarely even notice I got any canker sore.  </li>
      <li>Turns out, she had the same problem, and uses the same toothpaste too with great success!</li>
      <li>Another plus is that it tastes nice, unlike some other SLS free toothpastes.</li>
      <li>THIS PRODUCT IS ALSO GOOD FOR OTHER CUTS OR ACCIDENTAL INJURY TO THE MOUTH.  </li>
      <li>(I mention this for anyone who needs it right away...</li>
      <li>The toothpaste is wonderful for those of us who suffer canker sores, as it is the only toothpaste I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t contain harsh detergents like Sodium Laurel Sulfate.  </li>
      <li>but since using rembrandt C religiously for years it has greatly cut back on their occurrence.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very gently to my gums and tongue so</li>
      <li>It is very gentle on my teeth</li>
      <li>I very much like this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing that something so simple could make such a huge difference.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m sure everyone who&#x27;s had or currently has braces knows of their discomforts.</li>
      <li>Since consistently using Rembrandt he has had maybe one canker sore in 8 months...</li>
      <li>It can feel funny at first when the toothpaste does not foam up, but after a while I stopped noticing.    </li>
      <li>Amazon is the only place I seem to be able to find this product anymore.  </li>
      <li>It tastes better than my Crest 3D White I had been using for awhile.</li>
      <li>Many years ago I started suffering from regular canker sores.</li>
      <li>He&#x27;s been using it for a couple of years now and has had exactly one canker sore in that time.</li>
      <li>The SLS in toothpaste dries out the inside of your mouth making it more likely for you to have canker sores.  </li>
      <li>I was encouraged during the first 3 weeks when I didn&#x27;t get any canker sores.</li>
      <li>When we first got married he was suffering from canker sores about twice a month.</li>
      <li>Maybe this toothpaste works great for the treatment of canker sores, but have not used it long enough to tell.</li>
      <li>so this is mostly a first impressions review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will get more when I&#x27;m finished with my current supply.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m seriously amazed and didn&#x27;t think it would work as well as it does - I would have been happy if it just reduced the time and severity of the canker sores.</li>
      <li>I wonder how much longer it will be available though since Amazon no longer offers it on a subscription.</li>
      <li>Not only is it more gentle when I have one, but it also dramatically reduces the number I get.  </li>
      <li>Imagine my frustration when pretty much every toothpaste out there had it in it -- even \\&quot;natural\\</li>
      <li>Since using this toothpaste for the last few years I have experienced a marked reduction in sores and those I do get now are smaller and heal much more quickly.</li>
      <li>the ONLY toothpaste i can use and not get a mouth full of cankers!</li>
      <li>others have said, I find it&#x27;s easy to use smaller portions of this toothpaste than I tend to use of \\&quot;normal,\\&quot; less-thick pastes.  </li>
      <li>I certainly get canker sores still.  </li>
      <li>but I am certain this helps reduce the frequency and severity.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to prevent and it certainly doesn&#x27;t help them heal faster.</li>
      <li>I was upset when my local drugstore stopped carrying this toothpaste, but luckily I can have it delivered when I need it through amazon!</li>
      <li>Thanks for putting it in your product line.</li>
      <li>and they really haven&#x27;t caused much pain at all.  </li>
      <li>It really helps keep me from getting canker sores.</li>
      <li>and I do sometime miss that feeling of intense toothpaste foaminess, but I do still have that fresh-and-revived-just-brushed-my-teeth-feeling when using Rembrandt C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It works very well, and no any problems has been found.</li>
      <li>This product really does help me keep the canker sores in my mouth to a minimum.</li>
      <li>I had constantly been using another brand of SLS free toothpaste for months, thinking that it might help, but it did nothing.</li>
      <li>I really like this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I got ripped off on how much money I paid for just the 1 tube.</li>
      <li>Why they discontinued this product, I don&#x27;t know but decided to gouge us for the last tubes available.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Rembrant&#x27;s SLS free toothpaste for several years now.  </li>
      <li>I found only two that were free of SLS:</li>
      <li>The key is that this toothpaste is an SLS free toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Helps prevents canker sores, plus does not cause as much pain to use when you do have one.</li>
      <li>well, it really works.  </li>
      <li>It really speed up the healing.</li>
      <li>These toothpastes, without sodium laurel sulfate, are fabulous at reducing the frequency or even totally eliminating canker sores!</li>
      <li>so I cant really comment yet on how well it does to prevent cankers sores</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve absolutely noticed a difference in our household.</li>
      <li>The taste is really yummy.</li>
      <li>They stayed with me for days and really disrupted how I felt and</li>
      <li>I rarely get a canker sore, and now when I do they clear up in a day or two.</li>
      <li>Hopefully it never gets discontinued, if it does I&#x27;ll have to stockpile up a whole bunch.</li>
      <li>It really helped reducing the occurrence of canker sores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have suffered from canker sores my whole life.</li>
      <li>I switched to Biotene and am much happier.</li>
      <li>I have been using this gentle toothpaste for years now</li>
      <li>If you suffer from canker sores, this may very well help.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad amazon started to carry it at a reasonable price because it has become harder to find in stores.</li>
      <li>My canker sores are healing, and I will keep using this as my forever toothpaste, seeing as many people said they only get 2-3 canker sores a year when using it, which is better than the 10-15 I usually get.</li>
      <li>I cannot speak for Rembrandt&#x27;s other tooth pastes, but the one for canker sores is top of my list.</li>
      <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, it has seemed to be more uniform from tube to tube in the past year or so, so maybe their quality control has improved.  </li>
      <li>I love this product and have not used any other toothpaste, since!</li>
      <li>We used to be able to get this anywhere, but then only Walgreens carried it and now I can only find it here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>It makes it slightly more difficult to brush your top teeth but nothing to crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>That said, I highly recommend this toothpase to anyone who is a chronic canker sore sufferer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this toothpaste for anyone who gets canker sores.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this toothpaste to all canker sore sufferers.   </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend giving this a try if you also suffer from chronic canker sores.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend to anyone suffering from this type of ailment..</li>
      <li>Stop drinking beverages with high amounts of citric acid</li>
      <li>We decided to try it to see if it really worked, and she was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
      <li>Therefore, it doesn&#x27;t foam in your mouth like a normal toothpaste would.</li>
      <li>I used to get canker sores all the time until I read that they can sometimes be caused by allergic reactions to SLS in normal toothpastes.</li>
      <li>It was still worth it back then.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried to find out exactly what it is that the canker sore toothpaste from Rembrandt has that other Rembrandt toothpastes don&#x27;t, but without success.</li>
      <li>it is really easy to drool this down the front on your shirt.</li>
      <li>I have tried and tried to live with them.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve searched high and low for toothpaste that the whole family can use, that is gentle for our sensitive mouths.</li>
      <li>It won&#x27;t cut them out of your life completely, but for me, it&#x27;s reduced the numbers by quite a lot!</li>
      <li>/&gt;While I&#x27;ve used this toothpaste almost exclusively for the last 15 years or so, I&#x27;ve also tried some other brands of toothpaste that don&#x27;t contain sodium lauryl sulfate over the years when I haven&#x27;t been able to find this one.</li>
      <li>It does brush a little funny (because it is missing the chemical that causes toothpaste to foam up), but honestly I have not had a canker sore in almost 2 years.</li>
      <li>Also, and this may seem strange, this toothpaste is much more foamy than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>toothpaste tastes just fine but seems to clean a little less in my opinion.</li>
      <li>Wow.  </li>
      <li>I HAVE USED REMBRANDT PREMIUM WHITENING MINT TOOTHPASTE WITH FLUORIDE, EXTRA GENTLE FOR CANKER SORE SUFFERERS TO PREVENT CANKER SORES.  </li>
      <li>The only thing that I will mention is that it doesn&#x27;t really whiten your teeth.</li>
      <li>, I would recommend it even to children and sensitive people.</li>
      <li>toothpaste is the only thing that has absolutely reduced the amount of cankersores I get.  </li>
      <li>One of them is enormous and has been spreading like wildfire for a week straight.</li>
      <li>My gums don&#x27;t get sore anymore and no canker sores so far.  </li>
      <li>we &#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
      <li>Growing up, I would eat fruits nearly every day.</li>
      <li>What this toothpaste did for me is leave me with some very sore gums after only a couple uses.</li>
      <li>and I switched to toothpaste that does not have Sodium Laurel Sulfate that they became nearly a non-issue.  </li>
      <li>I switched to Rembrandt to avoid sodium laurel sulphate since I get frequent canker sores in my mouth.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more expensive, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>I was when I first starting using this toothpaste last year.</li>
      <li>This product arrived and the consistency of it was very watery and strange.</li>
      <li>I also try to avoid SLS, but need fluoride toothpaste because I have weak teeth (scarlet fever as an infant), and this is pretty mild.</li>
      <li>For me, one canker sore is the beginning of a chain reaction of new canker sores that can last for weeks.</li>
      <li>Also, this one is very gentle and painless to brush compared with other products.</li>
      <li>Others can list the technical reasons why this toothpaste works, I&#x27;ll just say that if you use this toothpaste, the number of canker sores you get should diminish to near zero and the ones that do occur won&#x27;t flare up to anything major.</li>
      <li>My ten year old son has had chronic canker sores since he was two.  </li>
      <li>After looking for years for ways to get rid of my canker sores, I tried this, after my dentist told me some people are overly sensitive to the sodium lauryl sulfate in regular toothpaste.</li>
      <li>For some reason, we didn&#x27;t note the fact that it&#x27;s a whitening toothpaste with fluoride -- we like the natural approach definitely WITHOUT FLUORIDE!!!</li>
      <li>Sodium laureth sulfate apparently contributes to canker sores.  </li>
      <li>If I use another toothpaste for even 1 brushing, I usually wind up with a mouth full of sores within days.  </li>
      <li>This product is a lifesaver although it is kind of expensive.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m willing to give that up for even one less canker sore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The toothpaste does not foam which I found odd at first.</li>
      <li>It may be a little more expensive, but it is very worth the extra cost.  </li>
      <li>Even though he is not sure whether it&#x27;s the toothpaste that does the trick, he strongly preferred to keep using this instead of any other toothpaste</li>
      <li>But, like that first month, the sores I&#x27;ve gotten since switching have consistently been far less painful, and go away quickly.   </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m giving this product four stars and not five because I don&#x27;t really see any whitening benefits and because it feels different (less foamy) than regular toothpaste.</li>
      <li>My dentist had prescribed B12, which seemed to help a little, but not too much.  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy any other brand and had to go out of my way to order the canker sore formula on Amazon because none of the local stores around here (upstate New York) carry it yet.</li>
      <li>After switching to this product the number of canker sores I would get in a year dropped significantly and now I only get a few (probably less than 4) each year.</li>
      <li>This is an amazing tooth paste for all canker sore suffers.  </li>

<li> good, I like it!</li>
<li> It works great and it has the recommended minimum flouride requirements also.  </li>
<li> It worked great.  </li>
<li> After reading all of these great reviews, I decided to give this toothpaste a try.</li>
<li> I heard this is a great product</li>
<li> lol.</li>
<li> LOVE the auto-ship since I can&#x27;t find this product anyplace in my area!!</li>
<li> This toothpaste is very effective at preventing canker sores.  </li>
<li> Put simply, it&#x27;s very effective at reducing canker sores.</li>
<li> This is a very nice toothpaste.</li>
<li> This thing is amazing!</li>
<li> AMAZING!</li>
<li> Being able to order from Amazon is great!  </li>
<li> Buy, it will be pleasant to you.</li>
<li> /&gt;Rembrandt has a pleasant flavor and seems to do a good job on my teeth.</li>
<li> It also is fairly inconsistent in its... consistency.  </li>
<li> it is so good</li>
<li> I sampled both, and found Rembrandt to be superior in terms of taste and \\&quot;mouth</li>
<li> It does nothing for your breath and doesn&#x27;t taste good.</li>
<li> I loved this product when Rembrandt still made it.</li>
<li> Reduce stress is also a good way to prevent canker sore if you can help it.  </li>
<li> This tooth paste is not as good as what I used to get.</li>
<li> But this brand didn&#x27;t do a good job at removing the tarter.</li>
<li> Super!!!</li>
<li> I love that Amazon lets me use subscribe &amp; save for this product, but even without it, I still think the price is great.</li>
<li> Rembrandt better never stop making this!</li>
<li> I love this toothpaste!</li>
<li> It cannot be healthy!</li>
<li> The price is OK for this item!</li>
<li> Thanx for smooth transactions!!</li>
<li> and I love the mint flavor it leaves after brushing!</li>
<li> Love this product but $22.00 per tube is highway robbery!  </li>
<li> Great product, mild pleasant mint and non-irritating.  </li>
<li> Very excited to try this toothpaste out after reading all of the reviews!</li>
<li> This tooth paste is amazing</li>
<li> This product is amazing.  </li>
<li> This toothpaste is amazing if you get canker sores.  </li>
<li> but it cleans effectively.</li>
<li> We have used this product for over 10 years with great success.</li>
<li> This toothpaste isn&#x27;t designed to treat canker sores once you get them, but it does a great job preventing them in the first place.</li>
<li> AT A GOOD PRICE AND QUICK SHIPMENT.</li>
<li> Also, I&#x27;m fairly sure it doesn&#x27;t do anything to fight plaque or tartar.</li>
<li> There are some interesting brands out there that would make you think they would work, but read the ingredients.</li>
<li> I have had monthly canker sores for many, many years.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never had more than one canker sore at a time now</li>
<li> I used to get a couple a month, it almost felt like I had cankers for more days of the year than I didn&#x27;t.      </li>
<li> I love this toothpaste.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m ordering more today.</li>
<li> My only complaints with this toothpaste: it isn&#x27;t the best tasting I&#x27;ve ever used; in fact, it&#x27;s quite an acquired taste.  </li>
<li> I had them every week, often two or more at a time.  </li>
<li> But it does make your breath better</li>
<li> I never thought I would be writing a review for toothpaste on Amazon, but I really had to share how great this stuff is.</li>
<li> I love this toothpaste.  </li>
<li> I just love to use this paste.</li>
<li> and I started getting canker sores more often.</li>
<li> I hope this trend continues :)</li>
<li> Love that it&#x27;s cheaper and easier to purchase in bulk --</li>
<li> Love this toothpaste.</li>
<li> I use this all the time and love Amazons bimonthly delivery option.</li>
<li> I love tomatoes, but get canker sores if I eat more than one.  </li>
<li> so I was glad to come across it on amazon.</li>
<li> but if it prevents canker sores then I will repurchase again! :)</li>
<li> Since I love both apples and pineapples, I decided to buy this toothpaste after reading the favorable reviews.</li>
<li> I have made a point to brush more there</li>
<li> and clean&amp;#60;3 i just love this:)</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never seen anything have a greater effect on me.</li>
<li> I am glad I did.</li>
<li> I just subscribe to this product nowadays to make sure my supply don&#x27;t run out.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve always loved rembrandt products because they really are effective and do what they promise to do -</li>
<li> I like the Canker Sore tooth paste much better for canker Sore control</li>
<li> It sure did for me.</li>
<li> It would be nice if it was priced better, but it works, and is worth it.</li>
<li> Perfect for those that have a sensitivity to other brands of paste.  </li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your mouth feeling like it&#x27;s been power washed with strong chemicals</li>
<li> I could not use it and do not recommend it, though it&#x27;s not as strong as some toothpastes.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s actually pretty amazing.</li>
<li> However, it&#x27;s much more satisfying to avoid the problem in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
<li> The flavor is light and easy on the pallet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> have this toothpaste on auto-order from Amazon and it works just fine.  </li>
<li> and he&#x27;s been fine ever since.</li>
<li> My husband has always suffered from canker sores &amp; although we have never found a cure, changing his toothpaste has made a tremendous difference!  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m super glad I found it.</li>
<li> Rembrandt C is SLS and surfactant free.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s the only toothpaste that is SLS-free with a great taste.</li>
<li> If anyone has some cheap tubes they want to get rid of, let me know.</li>
<li> The trick was finding a toothpaste that was free of this suspect ingredient.</li>
<li> br /&gt;It works, and it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
<li> guess this product is great for the majority, but I have to review based on my personal experience.</li>
<li> I am working toward making my life LSL free and this toothpaste is part of that.</li>
<li> I bought this a couple of days ago and so far so good</li>
<li> They work just the same at reducing canker sores but I greatly prefer this one in terms of taste, consistency, and perception of how clean it gets my teeth.</li>
<li> Now only get 1-2 ulcers at a time and very rarely do I get any at all!!!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s worth every penny if it works for you!</li>
<li> never imagined I&#x27;d be spending over $5 for a tube of toothpaste, but this toothpaste has made the difference for me and it is worth every penny!</li>
<li> At the first sign of canker sores be sure you are using this tooth paste.  </li>
<li> My front four top teeth are also bonded and this keeps the tea and coffee stains at bay pretty well without scratching.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s got a funny design but gentler, better, and cheaper.</li>
<li> It leaves your teeth clean and whitens are also others pluses.</li>
<li> When I&#x27;m not using this, I use a Japanese brand that I love that has a zillion flavors, but every now and again, I try to pierce my own cheek and switch to this.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little cheaper, very mild with a fresh taste and equally good!</li>
<li> Apparently, toothpaste makers found that people who don&#x27;t know any better (most people) think that \\&quot;suds\\&quot; &#x3D; clean.</li>
<li> The service was great and arrived before expected.</li>
<li> I have frequent outbreaks of canker sores that don&#x27;t seem to follow any kind of cycle.  </li>
<li> most of time it&#x27;s not -- I always snatch up as much as I can when I find it).</li>
<li> I bought it because it&#x27;s supposed to be good for your teeth but only buying 1</li>
<li> someone who doesn&#x27;t get but maybe one canker sore a month, I don&#x27;t have as much of a need for this product as many of those who purchase it, which may explain why I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in the amount of canker sores I got while using this product.</li>
<li> Love this gentle alternative to super foamy toothpastes.  </li>
<li> It is so mild.</li>
<li> Every couple weeks I&#x27;d have a new breakout of them, sometimes I&#x27;d have as many as 5 or 6.</li>
<li> I cannot live without this toothpaste any more.</li>
<li> I am just happy to be putting one less chemical in my body.</li>
<li> I used to get canker cores very frequently, and often I would have more than one, and sometimes up to five at a time.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many things to help alleviate my cankersores, natural remedies like propolis, suplements like L-Lysine, and the normal over the counter things like Anbesol and the like.</li>
<li> Fast shipping too!!</li>
<li> With burning mouth syndrome, I am highly sensitive to taste and most toothpastes are much too strong for me, including this one.</li>
<li> A huge improvement from the days when the pain was intense.)  </li>
<li> Very upset that this product is no longer available as one of my subscriptions.  </li>
<li> I researched the problem on my own (web) and found lots of discussion about sodium lauryl sulfate as a possible cause.  </li>
<li> If you have cankers, this is definitely worth a try for you.</li>
<li> All I know is that I rarely get canker sores anymore.</li>
<li> /&gt;It&#x27;s nice to finally have a whitening toothpaste that does not include the SLS ingredient.</li>
<li> absolutely worth trying.  </li>
<li> but well worth it.</li>
<li> It is worth the price and with \\&quot;subscribe and save\\</li>
<li> but I feel that in full disclosure people would appreciate the first opinion so they know what to expect off the bat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Totally worth it to avoid the pain/annoyance.</li>
<li> Now I rarely ever get them, and when I do they are never as sore as before.</li>
<li> I rarely even notice I got any canker sore.  </li>
<li> Turns out, she had the same problem, and uses the same toothpaste too with great success!</li>
<li> Another plus is that it tastes nice, unlike some other SLS free toothpastes.</li>
<li> THIS PRODUCT IS ALSO GOOD FOR OTHER CUTS OR ACCIDENTAL INJURY TO THE MOUTH.  </li>
<li> (I mention this for anyone who needs it right away...</li>
<li> The toothpaste is wonderful for those of us who suffer canker sores, as it is the only toothpaste I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t contain harsh detergents like Sodium Laurel Sulfate.  </li>
<li> but since using rembrandt C religiously for years it has greatly cut back on their occurrence.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s very gently to my gums and tongue so</li>
<li> It is very gentle on my teeth</li>
<li> I very much like this toothpaste.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s amazing that something so simple could make such a huge difference.</li>
<li> So I&#x27;m sure everyone who&#x27;s had or currently has braces knows of their discomforts.</li>
<li> Since consistently using Rembrandt he has had maybe one canker sore in 8 months...</li>
<li> It can feel funny at first when the toothpaste does not foam up, but after a while I stopped noticing.    </li>
<li> Amazon is the only place I seem to be able to find this product anymore.  </li>
<li> It tastes better than my Crest 3D White I had been using for awhile.</li>
<li> Many years ago I started suffering from regular canker sores.</li>
<li> He&#x27;s been using it for a couple of years now and has had exactly one canker sore in that time.</li>
<li> The SLS in toothpaste dries out the inside of your mouth making it more likely for you to have canker sores.  </li>
<li> I was encouraged during the first 3 weeks when I didn&#x27;t get any canker sores.</li>
<li> When we first got married he was suffering from canker sores about twice a month.</li>
<li> Maybe this toothpaste works great for the treatment of canker sores, but have not used it long enough to tell.</li>
<li> so this is mostly a first impressions review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I will get more when I&#x27;m finished with my current supply.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m seriously amazed and didn&#x27;t think it would work as well as it does - I would have been happy if it just reduced the time and severity of the canker sores.</li>
<li> I wonder how much longer it will be available though since Amazon no longer offers it on a subscription.</li>
<li> Not only is it more gentle when I have one, but it also dramatically reduces the number I get.  </li>
<li> Imagine my frustration when pretty much every toothpaste out there had it in it -- even \\&quot;natural\\</li>
<li> Since using this toothpaste for the last few years I have experienced a marked reduction in sores and those I do get now are smaller and heal much more quickly.</li>
<li> the ONLY toothpaste i can use and not get a mouth full of cankers!</li>
<li> others have said, I find it&#x27;s easy to use smaller portions of this toothpaste than I tend to use of \\&quot;normal,\\&quot; less-thick pastes.  </li>
<li> I certainly get canker sores still.  </li>
<li> but I am certain this helps reduce the frequency and severity.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to prevent and it certainly doesn&#x27;t help them heal faster.</li>
<li> I was upset when my local drugstore stopped carrying this toothpaste, but luckily I can have it delivered when I need it through amazon!</li>
<li> Thanks for putting it in your product line.</li>
<li> and they really haven&#x27;t caused much pain at all.  </li>
<li> It really helps keep me from getting canker sores.</li>
<li> and I do sometime miss that feeling of intense toothpaste foaminess, but I do still have that fresh-and-revived-just-brushed-my-teeth-feeling when using Rembrandt C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> It works very well, and no any problems has been found.</li>
<li> This product really does help me keep the canker sores in my mouth to a minimum.</li>
<li> I had constantly been using another brand of SLS free toothpaste for months, thinking that it might help, but it did nothing.</li>
<li> I really like this toothpaste.</li>
<li> I got ripped off on how much money I paid for just the 1 tube.</li>
<li> Why they discontinued this product, I don&#x27;t know but decided to gouge us for the last tubes available.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using Rembrant&#x27;s SLS free toothpaste for several years now.  </li>
<li> I found only two that were free of SLS:</li>
<li> The key is that this toothpaste is an SLS free toothpaste.</li>
<li> Helps prevents canker sores, plus does not cause as much pain to use when you do have one.</li>
<li> well, it really works.  </li>
<li> It really speed up the healing.</li>
<li> These toothpastes, without sodium laurel sulfate, are fabulous at reducing the frequency or even totally eliminating canker sores!</li>
<li> so I cant really comment yet on how well it does to prevent cankers sores</li>
<li> We&#x27;ve absolutely noticed a difference in our household.</li>
<li> The taste is really yummy.</li>
<li> They stayed with me for days and really disrupted how I felt and</li>
<li> I rarely get a canker sore, and now when I do they clear up in a day or two.</li>
<li> Hopefully it never gets discontinued, if it does I&#x27;ll have to stockpile up a whole bunch.</li>
<li> It really helped reducing the occurrence of canker sores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I have suffered from canker sores my whole life.</li>
<li> I switched to Biotene and am much happier.</li>
<li> I have been using this gentle toothpaste for years now</li>
<li> If you suffer from canker sores, this may very well help.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m glad amazon started to carry it at a reasonable price because it has become harder to find in stores.</li>
<li> My canker sores are healing, and I will keep using this as my forever toothpaste, seeing as many people said they only get 2-3 canker sores a year when using it, which is better than the 10-15 I usually get.</li>
<li> I cannot speak for Rembrandt&#x27;s other tooth pastes, but the one for canker sores is top of my list.</li>
<li> For what it&#x27;s worth, it has seemed to be more uniform from tube to tube in the past year or so, so maybe their quality control has improved.  </li>
<li> I love this product and have not used any other toothpaste, since!</li>
<li> We used to be able to get this anywhere, but then only Walgreens carried it and now I can only find it here on Amazon.</li>
<li> It makes it slightly more difficult to brush your top teeth but nothing to crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> That said, I highly recommend this toothpase to anyone who is a chronic canker sore sufferer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
<li> I highly recommend this toothpaste for anyone who gets canker sores.</li>
<li> I highly recommend this toothpaste to all canker sore sufferers.   </li>
<li> I would highly recommend giving this a try if you also suffer from chronic canker sores.</li>
<li> Highly recommend to anyone suffering from this type of ailment..</li>
<li> Stop drinking beverages with high amounts of citric acid</li>
<li> We decided to try it to see if it really worked, and she was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
<li> Therefore, it doesn&#x27;t foam in your mouth like a normal toothpaste would.</li>
<li> I used to get canker sores all the time until I read that they can sometimes be caused by allergic reactions to SLS in normal toothpastes.</li>
<li> It was still worth it back then.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried to find out exactly what it is that the canker sore toothpaste from Rembrandt has that other Rembrandt toothpastes don&#x27;t, but without success.</li>
<li> it is really easy to drool this down the front on your shirt.</li>
<li> I have tried and tried to live with them.</li>
<li> We&#x27;ve searched high and low for toothpaste that the whole family can use, that is gentle for our sensitive mouths.</li>
<li> It won&#x27;t cut them out of your life completely, but for me, it&#x27;s reduced the numbers by quite a lot!</li>
<li> /&gt;While I&#x27;ve used this toothpaste almost exclusively for the last 15 years or so, I&#x27;ve also tried some other brands of toothpaste that don&#x27;t contain sodium lauryl sulfate over the years when I haven&#x27;t been able to find this one.</li>
<li> It does brush a little funny (because it is missing the chemical that causes toothpaste to foam up), but honestly I have not had a canker sore in almost 2 years.</li>
<li> Also, and this may seem strange, this toothpaste is much more foamy than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve used.</li>
<li> toothpaste tastes just fine but seems to clean a little less in my opinion.</li>
<li> Wow.  </li>
<li> I HAVE USED REMBRANDT PREMIUM WHITENING MINT TOOTHPASTE WITH FLUORIDE, EXTRA GENTLE FOR CANKER SORE SUFFERERS TO PREVENT CANKER SORES.  </li>
<li> The only thing that I will mention is that it doesn&#x27;t really whiten your teeth.</li>
<li> , I would recommend it even to children and sensitive people.</li>
<li> toothpaste is the only thing that has absolutely reduced the amount of cankersores I get.  </li>
<li> One of them is enormous and has been spreading like wildfire for a week straight.</li>
<li> My gums don&#x27;t get sore anymore and no canker sores so far.  </li>
<li> we &#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
<li> Growing up, I would eat fruits nearly every day.</li>
<li> What this toothpaste did for me is leave me with some very sore gums after only a couple uses.</li>
<li> and I switched to toothpaste that does not have Sodium Laurel Sulfate that they became nearly a non-issue.  </li>
<li> I switched to Rembrandt to avoid sodium laurel sulphate since I get frequent canker sores in my mouth.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s more expensive, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
<li> I was when I first starting using this toothpaste last year.</li>
<li> This product arrived and the consistency of it was very watery and strange.</li>
<li> I also try to avoid SLS, but need fluoride toothpaste because I have weak teeth (scarlet fever as an infant), and this is pretty mild.</li>
<li> For me, one canker sore is the beginning of a chain reaction of new canker sores that can last for weeks.</li>
<li> Also, this one is very gentle and painless to brush compared with other products.</li>
<li> Others can list the technical reasons why this toothpaste works, I&#x27;ll just say that if you use this toothpaste, the number of canker sores you get should diminish to near zero and the ones that do occur won&#x27;t flare up to anything major.</li>
<li> My ten year old son has had chronic canker sores since he was two.  </li>
<li> After looking for years for ways to get rid of my canker sores, I tried this, after my dentist told me some people are overly sensitive to the sodium lauryl sulfate in regular toothpaste.</li>
<li> For some reason, we didn&#x27;t note the fact that it&#x27;s a whitening toothpaste with fluoride -- we like the natural approach definitely WITHOUT FLUORIDE!!!</li>
<li> Sodium laureth sulfate apparently contributes to canker sores.  </li>
<li> If I use another toothpaste for even 1 brushing, I usually wind up with a mouth full of sores within days.  </li>
<li> This product is a lifesaver although it is kind of expensive.  </li>
<li> but I&#x27;m willing to give that up for even one less canker sore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The toothpaste does not foam which I found odd at first.</li>
<li> It may be a little more expensive, but it is very worth the extra cost.  </li>
<li> Even though he is not sure whether it&#x27;s the toothpaste that does the trick, he strongly preferred to keep using this instead of any other toothpaste</li>
<li> But, like that first month, the sores I&#x27;ve gotten since switching have consistently been far less painful, and go away quickly.   </li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this product four stars and not five because I don&#x27;t really see any whitening benefits and because it feels different (less foamy) than regular toothpaste.</li>
<li> My dentist had prescribed B12, which seemed to help a little, but not too much.  </li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy any other brand and had to go out of my way to order the canker sore formula on Amazon because none of the local stores around here (upstate New York) carry it yet.</li>
<li> After switching to this product the number of canker sores I would get in a year dropped significantly and now I only get a few (probably less than 4) each year.</li>
<li> This is an amazing tooth paste for all canker sore suffers.  </li>
<li> I hope other companies will replace SLS with healthier ingredients in the near future.</li>
<li> I think $6 for a half a regular toothpaste&#x27;s size is kind of expensive</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never had issues with getting toothpaste stains on anything while brushing until I started using this stuff; a minor inconvenience though which is definitely preventable and my fault.</li>
<li> I get canker sores much less frequently now.  </li>
<li> There are some consumers which claim that using Rembrandt makes their gums more sensitive and painful while brushing teeth.</li>
<li> The next month, I only got one or two canker sores, and they barely hurt and were gone in a few days.</li>
<li> The effects of switching to an SLS-free toothpaste were quick and dramatic.</li>
<li> I used to have at least one all the time it seemed, but after switching to Rembrandt gentle, I get about three per year.  </li>
<li> I have been a long time sufferer of canker sores/ulcers inside my mouth.</li>
<li> /&gt;Since this product omits the usually obligatory surfactant &#x27;sodium lauryl sulfate&#x27; it does not foam up like normal toothpaste at all.</li>
<li> I have been using this toothpaste for about 6 months now and have gotten one minor canker in that time.</li>
<li> My husband has suffered from mouth ulcers for as long as he can remember.  </li>
<li> Not sure what that&#x27;s about, but I have grown to live with it.  </li>
<li> On the rare occasion I do have a canker sore, I know that it will not develop into a large painful problem.  </li>
<li> And then there&#x27;s all the money you save on Campho-phenique and other topical treatments, now that there are no sores to ameliorate.</li>
<li> Anyhow there are other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; toothpaste products without SLS, but I actually want the Floride for cavity prevention, so Rembrant remains my preferred toothpaste.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used it for several years, but it is getting harder and harder to find.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years, and I now have canker sore outbreaks only a few times per year.  </li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t had a single canker sore since 2002 when I found this product.</li>
<li> I just wish it was easier to find it in single packs since it&#x27;s a bit pricey.</li>
<li> Constantly have average or 3-4 canker sores any given day.  </li>
<li> I used to have them all the time - almost constantly, but in using this toothpaste, I&#x27;m down to two or three a year.  </li>
<li> As in: one tube will be very soft and \\&quot;paste-y\\&quot;, but the next tube will be very hard, almost a clay-like consistency.  </li>
<li> Now I get canker sores perhaps twice a year, and they last half the time they used to.</li>
<li> The back of my teeth, up front, have felt like slightly unclean.</li>
<li> These are not true to all those who use Rembrandt and definitely, our body reacts to substances</li>
<li> Of course eating was incredibly painful when I had that many.  </li>
<li> I get cold sores, always have, and using and LSL free toothpaste is shown to help the frequency of the outbreaks.</li>
<li> My only complaint is that I wish I could have had this ten years ago!</li>
<li> My only complaint is the tube cap...not always the easiest to put back on.</li>
<li> Now I only get them a few times a year.  </li>
<li> I tried it and have only gotten a few canker sores since.  </li>
<li> I am wondering why almost all personal care &amp; beauty product companies put this harsh chemical SLS in their products.</li>
<li> Be careful with (and avoid) foods that rough up the inside of my mouth -</li>
<li> Following the worst canker sore double-whammy of my ENTIRE life, I had my mouth full of baking soda, tears in my eyes from the pain searching far and wide for something that might help.</li>
<li> This toothpaste isn&#x27;t frothy or foamy like other toothpaste</li>
<li> I had been getting constant cancer sores, usually 1 or 2 at a time</li>
<li> I was skeptical at first because i got another a day or so after i started using it.  </li>
<li> I only wish it wasnt so expensive for such a tiny tube.</li>
<li> Like other Rembrandt toothpastes it also leaves your teeth feeling cleaner than any other brand can, and sustains whitening.</li>
<li> The whitening ingredient in other toothpaste gives me canker sores.  </li>
<li> I have not had a canker sore since, probably due to the lack of SLS.  </li>
<li> Other than preventing canker sore, this helps brighten your teeth.</li>
<li> With other tootpaste I use to get 3-20 ulcers at one time.</li>
<li> I need this product since I am allergic to an ingredient in other toothpastes.  </li>
<li> I used to get 3 or 4 in my mouth at one time every other month.</li>
<li> It is absolutely the answer to anyone who suffers from canker sores and I do not understand why the manufacturer is not distributing locally.  </li>
<li> That means I spent about half of the year in canker</li>
<li> It combines with your saliva to form a relatively thin white fluid.</li>
<li> It is hard to find locally.</li>
<li> I would buy the medicine to put on them to dull the pain, but the actual sore would not go away any quicker.</li>
<li> I have a hard time finding it locally</li>
<li> Only complaint is the price for the amount you get.</li>
<li> it boils down to is this.</li>
<li> If you are lucky and your drugstore sells this product you have to pay about $7.99 which I find very expensive for a toothpaste.</li>
<li> All other toothpastes have harsh detergents which cause canker sores.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had trouble with other pastes and canker sores, but after buying Rembrandt and using it for awhile I no longer have ANY canker sores.  </li>
<li> I have used this toothpaste for several years, and found it increasingly difficult to find locally.  </li>
<li> and ive noticed a slight whitening effect.  </li>
<li> Cheaper than buying it from the drugstore and with less hassle.</li>
<li> The only negative of this product is that the tube does often get a hole in the side before it&#x27;s gone, which wastes and dries out the toothpaste some.</li>
<li> A few months ago, however, I started to notice I would develop at least one if not multiple canker sores every time I ate an apple or a pineapple.</li>
<li> I bought a 3-pack from Amazon in January (5 months ago) for $15, and now it&#x27;s at least $19 for a single tube.  </li>
<li> Less foam and slightly reduced cleaning power are small trade offs for less canker sores.</li>
<li> SLS provides little benefit, except that it acts as a sudsing agent in everything from toothpastes to shampoos to hand soaps and even cleaning products.</li>
<li> It is very hard to find it in stores locally, so</li>
<li> Now I only get one every few months and they aren&#x27;t nearly as painful and don&#x27;t last nearly as long.</li>
<li> I recently started reading about a very common foaming agent in toothpastes, shampoos, and soaps...SLS, or sodium lauryl sulfate.</li>
<li> It reduced her occurence of cold sores by about 90%, and when she does get them, they seem to heal much quicker than previously.&lt;br</li>
<li> /&gt;So, for preventing cold sores, it really does the job.</li>
<li> I tried this toothpaste after reading the reviews and after a few weeks I noticed a drastic change.</li>
<li> My girlfriend told me to look for a prescription which turned out to be a waste of time.  </li>
<li> THIS PRODUCT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO FIND IN STORES; AMAZON OFFERS IT</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for a few years now.</li>
<li> If you have trouble with canker sores, this toothpaste will solve it.</li>
<li> I have been using this for years due to mouth sores, but it is hard to find.  </li>
<li> I now get cankers very rarely (usually when I do not treat my body well - excess drinking, little sleep, not eating well) and even then they do not linger for 2 weeks like before.  </li>
<li> IF I get a sore, it&#x27;s small and goes almost unnoticed.  </li>
<li> I used to get sores at least once a month - I have not gotten one since switching to this toothpaste, which I&#x27;ve been using for a year and a half now.</li>
<li> Then, finally I stumbled across something that stated that while it wasn&#x27;t known exactly what causes canker sores in all cases (and why some people get them and others don&#x27;t), it had been learned that this nasty little chemical called SODIUM LAURYL SULFATE (SLS) was no friend to those of us in the canker sore club.</li>
<li> With this toothpaste, it lessened my frequency of getting the sores to 2-3 times a year and there is little or no pain when he paste touches the sore!  </li>
<li> They are usually healing by 5 or 6 days in.    </li>
<li> Sometimes they will last for weeks at a time, making it difficult for me to work and socialize (I&#x27;m a therapist,</li>
<li> Often, the taste is worse when the toothpaste is harder.  </li>
<li> I also see no whitening difference, and I usually can with Rembrandt products.</li>
<li> Ive even had cuts in my mouth (which usually turn into sores) and they just went away.</li>
<li> Very shortly after starting to use this toothpaste, my crazy never-ending canker sore outbreak was gone!</li>
<li> Not sure what I am going to do.</li>
<li> so I usually purchase a couple of tubes at a time.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very irritating for skin, especially canker sores.</li>
<li> I bought this toothpaste at the recommendation of my daughter&#x27;s dentist, she is a cronic canker sore sufferer and this toothpaste is one of the very few that does not contain sodium lauryl sulfate.</li>
<li> /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find in the supermarket or drugstore, so I stock up online.  </li>
<li> However, Rembrandt toothpaste for Canker Sore Sufferers is hard to find in drug stores sometimes, so I always order it at amazon.</li>
<li> /&gt;The toothpaste experience is rather dull and it feels like your not cleaning your teeth all that well.  </li>
<li> For some reason this is hard to find</li>
<li> Nothing against yogurt, but you get a little tired of it if you have to eat it all the time.</li>
<li> getting at least 10 at-a-time &amp; a swollen tongue every couple of months.  </li>
<li> dad is a dentist and told me ages ago about the correlation between sodium lauryl sulfate, a common detergent in virtually every toothpaste (it&#x27;s the stuff that makes it foam up), and canker sores.</li>
<li> but I hate them so much</li>
<li> The smallish tube therefore is less expensive than it seems.  </li>
<li> It seems almost impossible to get in big box or pharmacies.</li>
<li> I was hopeful that it would work but a little bit skeptical that anything could help.</li>
<li> A little expensive.</li>
<li> They&#x27;ll rub against the inside of your lips and you&#x27;ll sometimes be left with canker sores or painful wounds.</li>
<li> Yes, the dentist-applied treatments such as Debacterol work well, if painfully.</li>
<li> I had a canker sore for couple days, the next day after I used this product, the painful feeling was gone and sore started to heal.</li>
<li> years I&#x27;ve used \\&quot;dry mouth\\&quot; or very expensive brands of toothpaste with no sodium laurel sulfate (the foaming agent in toothpaste and shampoo).</li>
<li> Decreased my canker sores by 75%</li>
<li> (poor college student here).</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t have a bad taste, either, like other toothpastes for without lauryl sulfate that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Every since I was a child I got Canker Sores inside my mouth periodically that were painful and annoying (note that they are very different from cold sores which can be outside the mouth).  </li>
<li> Each month, I&#x27;d get around half dozen painful sores that made everything a literal pain, from eating to talking to kissing my boyfriend.</li>
<li> I hated that all the medicine or numbing medication to put on canker sores to was all reactive medicine, but finally this toothpaste is proactive approach to solving your canker sore woes!</li>
<li> I only found one, and it tasted terrible!</li>
<li> It makes me sad</li>
<li> /&gt;I was skeptical about it&#x27;s whitening properties, but after about a month</li>
<li> All in my family get canker sores (unfortunately)</li>
<li> This has been discontinued and I&#x27;m sad.</li>
<li> Wrong.   </li>
<li> Unfortunately, it can be difficult to find in the stores (sometimes it&#x27;s there,</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t often have canker sores, but I have this horrible habit of biting myself in the cheek in the same place sometimes for days on end.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, this product does not prevent canker sores from forming in my case.</li>
<li> Disappointing.</li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also note that Canker Sores are a genetic condition and you can not spread them to others (unlike cold sores).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> My wife uses this toothpaste because she would ALWAYS get cold sores on her gums.  </li>
<li> Needless to say, we order this by the ton!</li>
<li> I get them bad...</li>
<li> really bad.</li>
<li> It was painful to talk or eat.</li>
<li> Even just brushing my teeth was almost too painful to bother with.</li>
<li> When you have a painful canker sore even something as routine as brushing your teeth hurts.  </li>
<li> Works well for canker sores/SLS allergies but difficult to find anymore (unless you want to pay a lot of money!!).  </li>
<li> This is very bad news for people that suffer from canker sores.</li>
<li> That sodium laurel sulfate is evil!  </li>
<li> I used to get awful canker sores -</li>
<li> n hated the pain of brushing!  </li>
<li> Before finding this product I suffered terribly with them.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This toothpaste is very effective at preventing canker sores.  I&#x27;ve used it for several years, but it is getting harder and harder to find.  I bought a 3-pack from Amazon in January (5 months ago) for $15, and now it&#x27;s at least $19 for a single tube.  This is very bad news for people that suffer from canker sores.</li>
    <li> love this stuff, but don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so expensive here. mistakenly thought the $22 was for 3 tubes! you can get this at drugstore.com or rembrandt website for 7 bucks</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful to help keep canker sores from happening. I used to have them all the time - almost constantly, but in using this toothpaste, I&#x27;m down to two or three a year.  It hasn&#x27;t done anything to whiten my teeth. I have never cared about that since just stopping the canker sores was my goal.  Also, I&#x27;m fairly sure it doesn&#x27;t do anything to fight plaque or tartar. Nothing in the description or the box says anything about that. You might want to talk to your dentist about that.  The reason this works is because it doesn&#x27;t have Sodium Lauryl Sulfate. I&#x27;ve looked in all kinds of stores from Walgreens to natural/organic specialty stores. There are some interesting brands out there that would make you think they would work, but read the ingredients. I only found one, and it tasted terrible!</li>
    <li> Wow.  I&#x27;ve had one canker sore in the six or so months since I started using this product.  One!  I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As others have said, I find it&#x27;s easy to use smaller portions of this toothpaste than I tend to use of \\&quot;normal,\\&quot; less-thick pastes.  The smallish tube therefore is less expensive than it seems.  And then there&#x27;s all the money you save on Campho-phenique and other topical treatments, now that there are no sores to ameliorate.</li>
    <li> I used to get 4 or 5 canker sores every month.  I was in agony.  About 10 years ago, a friend told me about this toothpaste and I haven&#x27;t used anything else since.  IF I get a sore, it&#x27;s small and goes almost unnoticed.  That sodium laurel sulfate is evil!  Rembrandt better never stop making this!</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste! It makes me sad it&#x27;s not made anymore.</li>
    <li> I received the correct toothpaste in a timely manner.  I have been using this for years due to mouth sores, but it is hard to find.  Thanks for putting it in your product line.</li>
    <li> Basically, this stuff works great!  I have even used a hippie toothpaste without SLS which did not work at all!  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just the lack of SLS or what, but thank god for it!  I still get them occasionally but they are kept at bay by this stuff.  They seem to be milder and resolve quicker.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m sure everyone who&#x27;s had or currently has braces knows of their discomforts. They&#x27;ll rub against the inside of your lips and you&#x27;ll sometimes be left with canker sores or painful wounds. Not only does this toothpaste prevent canker sores from developing but it also helps heal any you may already have. I no longer have to use wax to cover the brackets. This thing is amazing!</li>
    <li> My ten year old son has had chronic canker sores since he was two.  He&#x27;s been using the toothpaste for two months now and has not had any sores--at all.  My husband was so impressed we bought him a tube and his canker sores have disappeared too.  It&#x27;s amazing that something so simple could make such a huge difference.</li>
    <li> I have had monthly canker sores for many, many years.  I started using just this toothpaste about 6 months ago and I have not had one that I can recall since.  Well, maybe one.  What a relief.  Please return the pack of three to the subscribe and save program.</li>
    <li> Works well for canker sores/SLS allergies but difficult to find anymore (unless you want to pay a lot of money!!).  We&#x27;ve since switched to the Biotene brand toothpaste.  Cheaper and easier to find in stores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years now.  I used to have canker sores every month before using the toothpase.  Now I only get them a few times a year.  It works great and it has the recommended minimum flouride requirements also.  It doesn&#x27;t work for everyone one though.  I recommended this to a friend of mine and she said it didn&#x27;t work for her.</li>
    <li> I used to get canker sores so often that it was easier to count the days I was not afflicted.  I asked my doctor and my dentist, I even had a biopsy done on them (ouch!), but none of them had any advice.  I researched the problem on my own (web) and found lots of discussion about sodium lauryl sulfate as a possible cause.  I looked at every tube of toothpaste at the store and the all had it.  I finally found Rembrandt Naturals, and gave it a try.  It worked great.  I went from almost continuous canker sores to one every month or so.  I couldn&#x27;t find Rembrandt Naturals when I lived in Hawaii, so I looked online and found Rembrandt For Canker Sore Sufferers.  I have used both and I like that one the best.  The end.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been getting canker sores for years and they&#x27;ve caused a lot of pain.  Every couple weeks I&#x27;d have a new breakout of them, sometimes I&#x27;d have as many as 5 or 6. Of course eating was incredibly painful when I had that many.  I tried lots of different remedies until I finally read about Sodiom Laurel Sulfate being the cause and this toothepaste being the remedy.  I tried it and have only gotten a few canker sores since.  I&#x27;ve never had more than one canker sore at a time now and they really haven&#x27;t caused much pain at all.  So this toothepaste has truly been an answer to prayer.</li>
    <li> Ever since I started using this toothpaste, my problems with canker sores have been almost nonexistant. After looking for years for ways to get rid of my canker sores, I tried this, after my dentist told me some people are overly sensitive to the sodium lauryl sulfate in regular toothpaste. I guess that was my problem because this changed everything for me. I was upset when my local drugstore stopped carrying this toothpaste, but luckily I can have it delivered when I need it through amazon! If you have problems with canker sores in your mouth, this is definitely something to try! It&#x27;s worth every penny if it works for you!</li>
    <li> I wish I&#x27;d discovered/tried this product earlier. It really helps keep me from getting canker sores. For me, one canker sore is the beginning of a chain reaction of new canker sores that can last for weeks. And any mouth trauma (from aggressive flossing, biting my lip, or even bread that&#x27;s too toasted) is enough to start the cycle anew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, this is now my go-to toothpaste. I&#x27;ve been using it faithfully for about six months and I haven&#x27;t had any canker sores. It&#x27;s actually pretty amazing. This toothpaste isn&#x27;t frothy or foamy like other toothpaste and I do sometime miss that feeling of intense toothpaste foaminess, but I do still have that fresh-and-revived-just-brushed-my-teeth-feeling when using Rembrandt C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read that canker sores may be related to vitamin B deficiency so I have been sporadically taking vit. B in the last 6 months or so, as well. That said, I highly recommend this toothpase to anyone who is a chronic canker sore sufferer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find in the supermarket or drugstore, so I stock up online.  I have seen it at Bed, Bath and Beyond (I mention this for anyone who needs it right away...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this product four stars and not five because I don&#x27;t really see any whitening benefits and because it feels different (less foamy) than regular toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I used to get sores at least once a month - I have not gotten one since switching to this toothpaste, which I&#x27;ve been using for a year and a half now.</li>
    <li> My husband has always suffered from canker sores &amp; although we have never found a cure, changing his toothpaste has made a tremendous difference!  He had been using Sensodyne without the sodium laurel sulfate, but he would still have outbreaks.  Since consistently using Rembrandt he has had maybe one canker sore in 8 months...vs. getting at least 10 at-a-time &amp; a swollen tongue every couple of months.  We will be lifetime users of this product.</li>
    <li> Decreased my canker sores by 75%</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a year now and I can definitely say this formula has reduced my canker sores by 95%!  I used to get a couple a month, it almost felt like I had cankers for more days of the year than I didn&#x27;t.      But since I started using the Rembrandt I now get cankers very rarely (usually when I do not treat my body well - excess drinking, little sleep, not eating well) and even then they do not linger for 2 weeks like before.  They are usually healing by 5 or 6 days in.    I will never do without it!!!  It can feel funny at first when the toothpaste does not foam up, but after a while I stopped noticing.    If you have cankers, this is definitely worth a try for you.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste. It is so mild. I used to get canker sores continually, sometimes four at a time. It was painful to talk or eat. I tried this toothpaste after reading the reviews and after a few weeks I noticed a drastic change. Now I only get one every few months and they aren&#x27;t nearly as painful and don&#x27;t last nearly as long. I ran out and promptly have two canker sores! I&#x27;m ordering more today.</li>
    <li> I cannot live without this toothpaste any more. I haven&#x27;t had a single canker sore since 2002 when I found this product. SLS in toothpastes can cause canker sores in some people. This toothpaste doesn&#x27;t contain SLS. However, Rembrandt toothpaste for Canker Sore Sufferers is hard to find in drug stores sometimes, so I always order it at amazon. If you are lucky and your drugstore sells this product you have to pay about $7.99 which I find very expensive for a toothpaste. I am wondering why almost all personal care &amp; beauty product companies put this harsh chemical SLS in their products. It is just everywhere, even in shampoos and soaps. It cannot be healthy! I hope other companies will replace SLS with healthier ingredients in the near future. If you suffer from canker sores you might also try Burt&#x27;s Bees lavender toothpaste. It&#x27;s a little cheaper, very mild with a fresh taste and equally good!</li>
    <li> Have been using this for years.  Perfect for those that have a sensitivity to other brands of paste.  Will definitely continue purchasing!</li>
    <li> good, I like it! It works very well, and no any problems has been found. The price is OK for this item!</li>
    <li> This product is heaven sent for me.  I have frequent outbreaks of canker sores that don&#x27;t seem to follow any kind of cycle.  Sometimes they will last for weeks at a time, making it difficult for me to work and socialize (I&#x27;m a therapist, so when I can&#x27;t talk, it&#x27;s a problem).  My dentist had prescribed B12, which seemed to help a little, but not too much.  I can tell the difference with this toothpaste as soon as it goes on my teeth: it doesn&#x27;t burn my tongue!  It doesn&#x27;t have a bad taste, either, like other toothpastes for without lauryl sulfate that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical about it&#x27;s whitening properties, but after about a month or so I believe I am seeing a difference.</li>
    <li> Amazon is the only place I seem to be able to find this product anymore.  It is absolutely the answer to anyone who suffers from canker sores and I do not understand why the manufacturer is not distributing locally.  I highly recommend this product.  The service was great and arrived before expected.</li>
    <li> I have used this toothpaste for several years, and found it increasingly difficult to find locally.  Being able to order from Amazon is great!  The toothpaste is wonderful for those of us who suffer canker sores, as it is the only toothpaste I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t contain harsh detergents like Sodium Laurel Sulfate.  If I use another toothpaste for even 1 brushing, I usually wind up with a mouth full of sores within days.  My only complaints with this toothpaste: it isn&#x27;t the best tasting I&#x27;ve ever used; in fact, it&#x27;s quite an acquired taste.  It also is fairly inconsistent in its... consistency.  As in: one tube will be very soft and \\&quot;paste-y\\&quot;, but the next tube will be very hard, almost a clay-like consistency.  Often, the taste is worse when the toothpaste is harder.  Not sure what that&#x27;s about, but I have grown to live with it.  For what it&#x27;s worth, it has seemed to be more uniform from tube to tube in the past year or so, so maybe their quality control has improved.  So, if you are a canker sore-prone person, give this a shot!  It won&#x27;t cut them out of your life completely, but for me, it&#x27;s reduced the numbers by quite a lot!</li>
    <li> This product arrived and the consistency of it was very watery and strange. My friend who stayed at my house also noticed this. I also see no whitening difference, and I usually can with Rembrandt products. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this toothpaste for anyone who gets canker sores. I was using another toothpaste that was actually causing me to get canker sores.</li>
    <li> I used to get awful canker sores - I had them every week, often two or more at a time.  That&#x27;s when I came to the internet to do some research and I discovered that sodium lauryl sulfate could be the culprit.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years, and I now have canker sore outbreaks only a few times per year.  What a relief!  &lt;br /&gt;I never imagined I&#x27;d be spending over $5 for a tube of toothpaste, but this toothpaste has made the difference for me and it is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I had been getting constant cancer sores, usually 1 or 2 at a time but I always had them.  My girlfriend told me to look for a prescription which turned out to be a waste of time.  I stumbled on this toothpaste and after read the reviews i forked out money for a couple tubes.  I was skeptical at first because i got another a day or so after i started using it.  But its been about 3 weeks and havent had any since.  Ive even had cuts in my mouth (which usually turn into sores) and they just went away. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste experience is rather dull and it feels like your not cleaning your teeth all that well.  But it does make your breath better and ive noticed a slight whitening effect.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It definitely changed my quality of life and improved my relationship with my girlfriend (she will kiss me now).  I only wish it wasnt so expensive for such a tiny tube.</li>
    <li> All in my family get canker sores (unfortunately) but since using rembrandt C religiously for years it has greatly cut back on their occurrence.  If you get cankers then definitely try this out for some relief because you gotta brush your teeth anyway so it does double duty.  I&#x27;m glad amazon started to carry it at a reasonable price because it has become harder to find in stores.</li>
    <li> Cannot tell.  I certainly get canker sores still.  Fewer?  Do not know ... but I hate them so much, I will try anything to hopefully reduce occurrence.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried to find out exactly what it is that the canker sore toothpaste from Rembrandt has that other Rembrandt toothpastes don&#x27;t, but without success. That being the case, this stuff works. I used to eat yogurt once a week to avoid getting canker sores -- with this toothpaste, I don&#x27;t have to. It doesn&#x27;t work if you already have a canker sore, but it does seem to prevent them. Nothing against yogurt, but you get a little tired of it if you have to eat it all the time. I haven&#x27;t had any in over six months, and with the toothpaste, no canker sores. Like other Rembrandt toothpastes it also leaves your teeth feeling cleaner than any other brand can, and sustains whitening. I wouldn&#x27;t buy any other brand and had to go out of my way to order the canker sore formula on Amazon because none of the local stores around here (upstate New York) carry it yet. It&#x27;s more expensive, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> This product really does help me keep the canker sores in my mouth to a minimum. I get them bad...really bad. I still do but I am certain this helps reduce the frequency and severity. It doesn&#x27;t leave your mouth feeling as &amp;#34;minty clean&amp;#34; as others do but I&#x27;m willing to give that up for even one less canker sore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;ve used this toothpaste almost exclusively for the last 15 years or so, I&#x27;ve also tried some other brands of toothpaste that don&#x27;t contain sodium lauryl sulfate over the years when I haven&#x27;t been able to find this one. They work just the same at reducing canker sores but I greatly prefer this one in terms of taste, consistency, and perception of how clean it gets my teeth.</li>
    <li> I used to get canker cores very frequently, and often I would have more than one, and sometimes up to five at a time. After switching to this product the number of canker sores I would get in a year dropped significantly and now I only get a few (probably less than 4) each year. I am truly amazed by the difference this toothpaste has made.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED REMBRANDT PREMIUM WHITENING MINT TOOTHPASTE WITH FLUORIDE, EXTRA GENTLE FOR CANKER SORE SUFFERERS TO PREVENT CANKER SORES.  THIS PRODUCT IS ALSO GOOD FOR OTHER CUTS OR ACCIDENTAL INJURY TO THE MOUTH.  THIS PRODUCT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO FIND IN STORES; AMAZON OFFERS IT AT A GOOD PRICE AND QUICK SHIPMENT.</li>
    <li> I have always gotten canker sores from time to time, maybe once a month, but all of a sudden, I was getting them constantly. Even just brushing my teeth was almost too painful to bother with. I had constantly been using another brand of SLS free toothpaste for months, thinking that it might help, but it did nothing. After reading all of these great reviews, I decided to give this toothpaste a try. I was hopeful that it would work but a little bit skeptical that anything could help. There was no need for skepticism though! Very shortly after starting to use this toothpaste, my crazy never-ending canker sore outbreak was gone! This was two months ago, and I haven&#x27;t had another one since. I&#x27;m seriously amazed and didn&#x27;t think it would work as well as it does - I would have been happy if it just reduced the time and severity of the canker sores. Another plus is that it tastes nice, unlike some other SLS free toothpastes. I never thought I would be writing a review for toothpaste on Amazon, but I really had to share how great this stuff is. If you&#x27;re on the fence about trying it - just get one tube!</li>
    <li> Following the worst canker sore double-whammy of my ENTIRE life, I had my mouth full of baking soda, tears in my eyes from the pain searching far and wide for something that might help. I recently started reading about a very common foaming agent in toothpastes, shampoos, and soaps...SLS, or sodium lauryl sulfate. It&#x27;s very irritating for skin, especially canker sores. Rembrandt C is SLS and surfactant free. I express shipped this tube of goodness and my mouth is feeling great! My canker sores are healing, and I will keep using this as my forever toothpaste, seeing as many people said they only get 2-3 canker sores a year when using it, which is better than the 10-15 I usually get. Great product, very nice minty-ness to it! It tastes better than my Crest 3D White I had been using for awhile. The Rembrandt C doesn&#x27;t sting or irritate the canker sores that I currently have, seems to be helping them heal and hopefully will keep them away. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> This has been discontinued and I&#x27;m sad. It&#x27;s the only toothpaste that is SLS-free with a great taste. If anyone has some cheap tubes they want to get rid of, let me know.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste.  Being a canker sore sufferer for years, I can count on Rembrandt Extra Whitening Toothpaste Formulated For Canker Sore Sufferers &lt;br /&gt;to keep them to a minimum.  On the rare occasion I do have a canker sore, I know that it will not develop into a large painful problem.  This product is a lifesaver although it is kind of expensive.  The only drawback is the cost and you do have to use it all of the time to reap the benefits.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing tooth paste for all canker sore suffers.  When you have a painful canker sore even something as routine as brushing your teeth hurts.  This tooth paste is amazing it causes no scorching pain what so ever. It leaves your teeth clean and whitens are also others pluses. Great Buy!</li>
    <li> I really like this toothpaste. I just wish it was easier to find it in single packs since it&#x27;s a bit pricey. Very good for those who get canker sores like me.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Rembrandt Toothpaste for Canker Sore Sufferers for about six months now and have only gotten cancer sores twice in that amount of time.  To me, that&#x27;s very impressive.  The only thing that I will mention is that it doesn&#x27;t really whiten your teeth.</li>
    <li> I just love to use this paste. It&#x27;s very gently to my gums and tongue so, I would recommend it even to children and sensitive people.</li>
    <li> I thought I had ordered 3 tubes of toothpaste not 1 tube. I got ripped off on how much money I paid for just the 1 tube.</li>
    <li> This was the only toothpaste I used and now the price has skyrocketed to the point of being unaffordable.  The whitening ingredient in other toothpaste gives me canker sores.  This toothpaste does not.  I have since found that Arm &amp; Hammer has a whitening toothpaste I can use and it&#x27;s affordable.</li>
    <li> I have been using this toothpaste for years and people say my teeth are so white.  It&#x27;s the only toothpaste that I&#x27;ll use.</li>
    <li> I get canker sores and this toothpaste helped prevent them.  However the last time I tried to order the price had gone up to $125.  Why they discontinued this product, I don&#x27;t know but decided to gouge us for the last tubes available.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rembrant&#x27;s SLS free toothpaste for several years now.  I get canker sores much less frequently now.  (By the way, when I do get one I carry something like Ambesol gel around to kill any pain associated.  A huge improvement from the days when the pain was intense.)  Anyhow there are other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; toothpaste products without SLS, but I actually want the Floride for cavity prevention, so Rembrant remains my preferred toothpaste.  It is very hard to find it in stores locally, so now I don&#x27;t bother driving around looking and just order a bunch online every so often.</li>
    <li> How does it work it is so good , I like it , If you use it You will like it</li>
    <li> I suffered with canker sores for years. This toothpaste isn&#x27;t designed to treat canker sores once you get them, but it does a great job preventing them in the first place. There is a chemical in regular toothpaste that can provoke canker sores, and this product must not include that stuff. I know it works because I&#x27;ve tried using regular toothpaste and I started getting canker sores more often.</li>
    <li> Many years ago I started suffering from regular canker sores. Each month, I&#x27;d get around half dozen painful sores that made everything a literal pain, from eating to talking to kissing my boyfriend. Those puppies hurt like the Dickens, and would last about a week or two. That means I spent about half of the year in canker sore hell.  So I took to the internet to try to find a remedy. I tried every folk remedy, commercial ointment, diet change, etc. I could find. NOTHING helped. Then, finally I stumbled across something that stated that while it wasn&#x27;t known exactly what causes canker sores in all cases (and why some people get them and others don&#x27;t), it had been learned that this nasty little chemical called SODIUM LAURYL SULFATE (SLS) was no friend to those of us in the canker sore club. SLS provides little benefit, except that it acts as a sudsing agent in everything from toothpastes to shampoos to hand soaps and even cleaning products. Apparently, toothpaste makers found that people who don&#x27;t know any better (most people) think that \\&quot;suds\\&quot; &#x3D; clean. Wrong.   Thus began the search for a toothpaste without SLS. Imagine my frustration when pretty much every toothpaste out there had it in it -- even \\&quot;natural\\&quot; Tom&#x27;s! I found only two that were free of SLS: Rembrandt Canker Sore and Biotene. I sampled both, and found Rembrandt to be superior in terms of taste and \\&quot;mouth feel\\&quot; after brushing. Plus it has whitening! Hooray!  The effects of switching to an SLS-free toothpaste were quick and dramatic. The next month, I only got one or two canker sores, and they barely hurt and were gone in a few days. Soon, I found the canker sores weren&#x27;t appearing at all anymore! And now, the only time I get them is if I sustain an injury to my mouth (pointy tortilla chip to the gums, anyone?). But, like that first month, the sores I&#x27;ve gotten since switching have consistently been far less painful, and go away quickly.   I haven&#x27;t touched regular toothpaste since, and will scour the earth looking for this stuff if I have to. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to find in the stores (sometimes it&#x27;s there, most of time it&#x27;s not -- I always snatch up as much as I can when I find it). Thank God for Amazon, because they seem to always have it in stock.   As a side note, I was talking to my dental hygienist last year (my dentist&#x27;s wife), and mentioned how I used to get canker sores, but started using Rembrandt&#x27;s Canker Sore toothpaste and they went away. Turns out, she had the same problem, and uses the same toothpaste too with great success! She (and her husband) now recommend it to all of their patients who have issues with canker sores.</li>
    <li> I used to get canker sores every month n hated the pain of brushing!  With this toothpaste, it lessened my frequency of getting the sores to 2-3 times a year and there is little or no pain when he paste touches the sore!  I love this product and have not used any other toothpaste, since!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for a few years now. Put simply, it&#x27;s very effective at reducing canker sores. &lt;br /&gt;My dad is a dentist and told me ages ago about the correlation between sodium lauryl sulfate, a common detergent in virtually every toothpaste (it&#x27;s the stuff that makes it foam up), and canker sores. The trick was finding a toothpaste that was free of this suspect ingredient. When this Rembrandt version came on the market, I immediately gave it a try. I haven&#x27;t looked back. &lt;br /&gt;I used to experience outbreaks about every eight weeks. Now I get canker sores perhaps twice a year, and they last half the time they used to. Yes, the dentist-applied treatments such as Debacterol work well, if painfully. However, it&#x27;s much more satisfying to avoid the problem in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;Does it whiten your teeth too? Beats me. I haven&#x27;t noticed. All I know is that I rarely get canker sores anymore. Whiter teeth are a bonus.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many things to help alleviate my cankersores, natural remedies like propolis, suplements like L-Lysine, and the normal over the counter things like Anbesol and the like. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste is the only thing that has absolutely reduced the amount of cankersores I get.  Since I started using it, I&#x27;ve had maybe 3 or 4, which is about the same amount I got when I stopped using it because I didn&#x27;t have the cash to spend on it!  (poor college student here). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It works, and it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been getting 2 canker sores a month like clockwork for about a year.  I started using this toothepaste a month ago, and haven&#x27;t had a canker sore since!  I hope this trend continues :)</li>
    <li> My son got canker sores every couple of months since he was about 7.  Finally I heard about sensitivity to SLS in toothpaste and tried this product to see if maybe that was his problem.  He&#x27;s been using it for a couple of years now and has had exactly one canker sore in that time.</li>
    <li> We have used this product for over 10 years with great success. It seems almost impossible to get in big box or pharmacies.Hope you keep carrying it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never use another toothpaste if I can help it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years I&#x27;ve used \\&quot;dry mouth\\&quot; or very expensive brands of toothpaste with no sodium laurel sulfate (the foaming agent in toothpaste and shampoo). It does drastically reduce the occurrence of canker sores. Using such toothpastes, I go from getting about 6-10 a year to getting probably about 3 a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice to finally have a whitening toothpaste that does not include the SLS ingredient. I love that Amazon lets me use subscribe &amp; save for this product, but even without it, I still think the price is great.</li>
    <li> Wonderful Seller &amp; Great product!!! LOVE the auto-ship since I can&#x27;t find this product anyplace in my area!! Have used this religiously for almost 15 years and has been a God-send in keeping my cancer sores in check!!! Used to get up to 8 in my mouth at a time and this toothpaste has changed my life!!! Love that it&#x27;s cheaper and easier to purchase in bulk -- Fast shipping too!! Thanx for smooth transactions!! DON&#x27;T ever stop selling this!!! :D</li>
    <li> I have not had a canker sore in years since starting to use this product. It would be nice if it was priced better, but it works, and is worth it.</li>
    <li> I have dealt with canker sores all my life. If you&#x27;re reading this review then you&#x27;re probably in the same place I was when I first starting using this toothpaste last year. I hated that all the medicine or numbing medication to put on canker sores to was all reactive medicine, but finally this toothpaste is proactive approach to solving your canker sore woes! I highly recommend this toothpaste to all canker sore sufferers.   The key is that this toothpaste is an SLS free toothpaste. Therefore, it doesn&#x27;t foam in your mouth like a normal toothpaste would. The SLS in toothpaste dries out the inside of your mouth making it more likely for you to have canker sores.  Don&#x27;t expect this toothpaste to solve all outbreaks, but I have gone from having canker sores every couple weeks to every couple months. My only complaint is that I wish I could have had this ten years ago!</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste. Helps prevents canker sores, plus does not cause as much pain to use when you do have one. I use this all the time and love Amazons bimonthly delivery option. Cheaper than buying it from the drugstore and with less hassle. The only negative of this product is that the tube does often get a hole in the side before it&#x27;s gone, which wastes and dries out the toothpaste some.</li>
    <li> At the first sign of canker sores be sure you are using this tooth paste.  It is wonderful. I cannot speak for Rembrandt&#x27;s other tooth pastes, but the one for canker sores is top of my list.</li>
    <li> I get canker sores when using regular toothpaste so I switched to this product.  I have not had a canker sore since, probably due to the lack of SLS.  The toothpaste does not foam which I found odd at first. After getting used to it, I found that I prefer non-foaming toothpastes.</li>
    <li> Only use this product for a year now and I no longer get canker sores.  All other toothpastes have harsh detergents which cause canker sores.  This product is amazing.  I&#x27;m super glad I found it.</li>
    <li> My mouth doesn&#x27;t like acid.  I love tomatoes, but get canker sores if I eat more than one.  NOT ANYMORE!</li>
    <li> The product used to be wonderful, but the company has discontinued it.  I ordered it online and was overcharged.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I was getting 3 tubes, because the info said &amp;#34;3 units.&amp;#34;  When I opened it and saw one tube I realized it meant 3 ounces.&lt;br /&gt;It is the last time I will ever pay $30.00 for a tube of toothpaste that sold in the stores for $6.79.  I was conned.</li>
    <li> A local dentist recommened this for me. It is hard to find locally. What can be said for what I need it is just what I asked for.</li>
    <li> I have been a long time sufferer of canker sores/ulcers inside my mouth. Since using this toothpaste for the last few years I have experienced a marked reduction in sores and those I do get now are smaller and heal much more quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought this a couple of days ago and so far so good, no canker sore happened to me yet. Hopefully it will work all the time, we&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> bought this for my daughter who has almost constant canker sores and since doctors cant do anything for it, decided to give this a try as a last resort.  well, it really works.  she has not had a canker sore since starting this product and its been over a year now.  i have recommended to others and its worked for them too.  absolutely worth trying.  pricey, yes, but well worth it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 4 weeks. I was encouraged during the first 3 weeks when I didn&#x27;t get any canker sores. However by the third week I started to develop one, then another, then another. I currently have 3 canker sores in my mouth. One of them is enormous and has been spreading like wildfire for a week straight. It doesn&#x27;t seem to prevent and it certainly doesn&#x27;t help them heal faster.</li>
    <li> If you have trouble with canker sores, this toothpaste will solve it. It has virtually elminated mine. I used to get them once per month and now maybe 3 times per year...maybe....</li>
    <li> Having been a canker sore sufferer all my life, to have found this product was a godsend. Put simply- it works! Others can list the technical reasons why this toothpaste works, I&#x27;ll just say that if you use this toothpaste, the number of canker sores you get should diminish to near zero and the ones that do occur won&#x27;t flare up to anything major.</li>
    <li> I get this for my husband to help with his canker sores. He seems to be allergic to sodium lauryl sulfate and this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t contain any. When we first got married he was suffering from canker sores about twice a month. He has been on this about 3 years now and will get about 1-2 canker sores a year! That is a vast improvement. We used to be able to get this anywhere, but then only Walgreens carried it and now I can only find it here on Amazon. I would highly recommend giving this a try if you also suffer from chronic canker sores. It is worth the price and with \\&quot;subscribe and save\\&quot; I never worry about running out.</li>
    <li> I bought another tube of toothpaste around the same time I got this and like I said with that 1 I&#x27;ll say with this. I bought it because it&#x27;s supposed to be good for your teeth but only buying 1 it won&#x27;t have any effect, which is not the product&#x27;s fault. I won&#x27;t be buying anymore though. It does nothing for your breath and doesn&#x27;t taste good.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice toothpaste. A little expensive. I would recommend this brand to others. Other than preventing canker sore, this helps brighten your teeth. Super!!! What a great product!!!</li>
    <li> The product matches the description.</li>
    <li> For some reason this is hard to find so I was glad to come across it on amazon. I do like it. I don&#x27;t often have canker sores, but I have this horrible habit of biting myself in the cheek in the same place sometimes for days on end. I also try to avoid SLS, but need fluoride toothpaste because I have weak teeth (scarlet fever as an infant), and this is pretty mild. When I&#x27;m not using this, I use a Japanese brand that I love that has a zillion flavors, but every now and again, I try to pierce my own cheek and switch to this. My front four top teeth are also bonded and this keeps the tea and coffee stains at bay pretty well without scratching.</li>
    <li> My gums don&#x27;t get sore anymore and no canker sores so far.  I heard this is a great product and now I believe it.</li>
    <li> I went with subscribe-and-save for this product after my husband told me he saw a difference in the frequency of canker sores in his mouth. Even though he is not sure whether it&#x27;s the toothpaste that does the trick, he strongly preferred to keep using this instead of any other toothpaste we &#x27;ve tried so far. It seems like a very good product to him.</li>
    <li> For some reason, we didn&#x27;t note the fact that it&#x27;s a whitening toothpaste with fluoride -- we like the natural approach definitely WITHOUT FLUORIDE!!!</li>
    <li> It really speed up the healing. I had a canker sore for couple days, the next day after I used this product, the painful feeling was gone and sore started to heal. Also, this one is very gentle and painless to brush compared with other products.</li>
    <li> Very excited to try this toothpaste out after reading all of the reviews! It is very gentle on my teeth and I love the mint flavor it leaves after brushing! I think $6 for a half a regular toothpaste&#x27;s size is kind of expensive but if it prevents canker sores then I will repurchase again! :)</li>
    <li> I have had canker sores for years. These toothpastes, without sodium laurel sulfate, are fabulous at reducing the frequency or even totally eliminating canker sores! Can&#x27;t say enough!</li>
    <li> Great product, mild pleasant mint and non-irritating.  Would recommend it to anyone who has issues with stronger toothpaste. What else do you want me to say?</li>
    <li> Growing up, I would eat fruits nearly every day. A few months ago, however, I started to notice I would develop at least one if not multiple canker sores every time I ate an apple or a pineapple. Since I love both apples and pineapples, I decided to buy this toothpaste after reading the favorable reviews. Unfortunately, this product does not prevent canker sores from forming in my case. I still cannot eat pineapples or apples without consequences. Also, and this may seem strange, this toothpaste is much more foamy than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve never had issues with getting toothpaste stains on anything while brushing until I started using this stuff; a minor inconvenience though which is definitely preventable and my fault. The flavor is light and easy on the pallet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone who doesn&#x27;t get but maybe one canker sore a month, I don&#x27;t have as much of a need for this product as many of those who purchase it, which may explain why I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in the amount of canker sores I got while using this product. Based on my experiences, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for myself and 1for my son. We both suffer from canker sores inside the mouth. We have been using itt since July and neither have has a canker sore since. Excellent product. Highly recommend to anyone suffering from this type of ailment..</li>
    <li> Great product! Recommended by Doctor to reduce mouth ulcers. Reduces mouth ulcers and whitens you teeth at the same time!! With other tootpaste I use to get 3-20 ulcers at one time. Now only get 1-2 ulcers at a time and very rarely do I get any at all!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for the same reason any one else would... I get canker sores from time to time. Maybe this toothpaste works great for the treatment of canker sores, but have not used it long enough to tell. What this toothpaste did for me is leave me with some very sore gums after only a couple uses. After some Google searching I found out there are others that had the same issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Rembrandt toothpaste is said to contain saccharin, a chemical which has been said to be toxic. There are some consumers which claim that using Rembrandt makes their gums more sensitive and painful while brushing teeth. These are not true to all those who use Rembrandt and definitely, our body reacts to substances uniquely.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess this product is great for the majority, but I have to review based on my personal experience.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a week so this is mostly a first impressions review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this product omits the usually obligatory surfactant &#x27;sodium lauryl sulfate&#x27; it does not foam up like normal toothpaste at all. It combines with your saliva to form a relatively thin white fluid. It makes it slightly more difficult to brush your top teeth but nothing to crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste tastes just fine but seems to clean a little less in my opinion. The back of my teeth, up front, have felt like slightly unclean. I have made a point to brush more there and it seems ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it boils down to is this. Less foam and slightly reduced cleaning power are small trade offs for less canker sores. I have only been using it for a week so I cant really comment yet on how well it does to prevent cankers sores but I feel that in full disclosure people would appreciate the first opinion so they know what to expect off the bat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I never update this then I probably never got any canker sores and therefore it works! lol.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is one of the best out there!! Make your teeth white and clean&amp;#60;3 i just love this:) &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Very upset that this product is no longer available as one of my subscriptions.  I need this product since I am allergic to an ingredient in other toothpastes.  Not sure what I am going to do.</li>
    <li> If you suffer from reoccuring canker sores, it could be brought on from the SLS in your toothpastes. We&#x27;ve absolutely noticed a difference in our household. It takes a bit getting use to the toothpaste not foaming...it is really easy to drool this down the front on your shirt. The taste is really yummy. Only complaint is the price for the amount you get. You will def want to cut back on the amount of paste you use on your brush.</li>
    <li> if you suffer from those pesky cankers, this is for you. the simple switch of toothpaste changed my life. I&#x27;ve never seen anything have a greater effect on me.</li>
    <li> Every since I was a child I got Canker Sores inside my mouth periodically that were painful and annoying (note that they are very different from cold sores which can be outside the mouth).  It was not until I learned that the detergents in toothpaste can cause them and I switched to toothpaste that does not have Sodium Laurel Sulfate that they became nearly a non-issue.  Once I realized the factors that triggered them and changed my habits, I almost never get them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three key items for me were:&lt;br /&gt;1. Stop drinking beverages with high amounts of citric acid&lt;br /&gt;2. Switch to toothpaste that does not have Sodium Laurel Sulfate&lt;br /&gt;3. Be careful with (and avoid) foods that rough up the inside of my mouth - this can cause a sore to form&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also note that Canker Sores are a genetic condition and you can not spread them to others (unlike cold sores).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have this toothpaste on auto-order from Amazon and it works just fine.  Totally worth it to avoid the pain/annoyance.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothpaste at the recommendation of my daughter&#x27;s dentist, she is a cronic canker sore sufferer and this toothpaste is one of the very few that does not contain sodium lauryl sulfate. I could not find it in any retail stores in my area, greatful for amazon!</li>
    <li> Sodium laureth sulfate apparently contributes to canker sores.  Since I started using Rembrandt, which does not contain Sodium laureth sulfate, I have not had any canker sores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rembrandt has a pleasant flavor and seems to do a good job on my teeth.</li>
    <li> Since I was a child I have suffered from Canker Sores on a regular basis. They stayed with me for days and really disrupted how I felt and what food I ate. I would buy the medicine to put on them to dull the pain, but the actual sore would not go away any quicker. This is like a wonder toothpaste. It does brush a little funny (because it is missing the chemical that causes toothpaste to foam up), but honestly I have not had a canker sore in almost 2 years. I use this in the morning and regular &amp;#34;foaming&amp;#34; toothpaste at night. If I feel a canker sore coming on, or I bite my lip, I switch to this full-time. AMAZING!</li>
    <li> I used to get canker sores all the time until I read that they can sometimes be caused by allergic reactions to SLS in normal toothpastes. I decided to switch and found this toothpaste to be a god send. I rarely get a canker sore, and now when I do they clear up in a day or two. If you&#x27;re a chronic canker sore sufferer give this a try and see if it helps. I know it helped me a ton. Hopefully it never gets discontinued, if it does I&#x27;ll have to stockpile up a whole bunch.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble with other pastes and canker sores, but after buying Rembrandt and using it for awhile I no longer have ANY canker sores.  I will get more when I&#x27;m finished with my current supply.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the last year, and let me tell you, I&#x27;ve kept this product on subscribe and save because I haven&#x27;t found any stores that carry this Rembrandt product. It definitaly works! I used to get canker sores often, like started getting them like over month or so. Now I rarely ever get them, and when I do they are never as sore as before. I don&#x27;t see myself ever stopping buying this. Lets just hope they never discontinue it!</li>
    <li> Well. I loved this product when Rembrandt still made it. It really helped reducing the occurrence of canker sores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I replaced it with Squigle toothpaste. It&#x27;s got a funny design but gentler, better, and cheaper. It&#x27;s time to move on people!</li>
    <li> I have suffered from canker sores my whole life. I have tried and tried to live with them. I have been using this toothpaste for about 6 months now and have gotten one minor canker in that time. I used to get 3 or 4 in my mouth at one time every other month. This is a miracle!</li>
    <li> I very much like this toothpaste. I have problems with gums. Paste helps to solve these problems. Buy, it will be pleasant to you.</li>
    <li> I suffered from canker sore since my childhood.  Constantly have average or 3-4 canker sores any given day.  My dentist mentioned this product to me more than 10 years ago, I thought it was way too expensive for a 3 oz tube, but I tried it anyway. I am glad I did. Back in the day, I&#x27;d say it reduce about 70%, just like its claim.  It was still worth it back then.  Now, they must have improve the formula.  I rarely even notice I got any canker sore.  Only occasionally when I bite myself and it turns into a canker sore or I get too stressed out and canker sores will start popping out.  Even those canker sores got heal faster than when i was growing up without the toothpaste.  Reduce stress is also a good way to prevent canker sore if you can help it.  I just subscribe to this product nowadays to make sure my supply don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is amazing if you get canker sores.  Not only is it more gentle when I have one, but it also dramatically reduces the number I get.  I used to have at least one all the time it seemed, but after switching to Rembrandt gentle, I get about three per year.  It may be a little more expensive, but it is very worth the extra cost.  I wonder how much longer it will be available though since Amazon no longer offers it on a subscription.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this toothpaste because she would ALWAYS get cold sores on her gums.  We decided to try it to see if it really worked, and she was pleasantly surprised.  It reduced her occurence of cold sores by about 90%, and when she does get them, they seem to heal much quicker than previously.&lt;br /&gt;So, for preventing cold sores, it really does the job.</li>
    <li> dentist said use this only and it works well</li>
    <li> My son had a chronic problem with canker sores - his pediatric dentist recommended this toothpaste and he&#x27;s been fine ever since. I have a hard time finding it locally so I usually purchase a couple of tubes at a time.</li>
    <li> My husband has suffered from mouth ulcers for as long as he can remember.  ANYTHING he eats will cause them and they would take up to two weeks to start fading away.  This is the ONLY toothpaste he has EVER tried that felt like toothpaste AND minimized his mouth ulcers by well over 50%.  AND it reduces the longevity and severity of his ulcers by WELL over 50%.  Needless to say, we order this by the ton!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved rembrandt products because they really are effective and do what they promise to do - of course, for the price you pay for them, you should expect that.</li>
    <li> Love this product but $22.00 per tube is highway robbery!  I got it at Drugstore.com for $7.99/tube - it was in stock as of 7/3/13.</li>
    <li> the ONLY toothpaste i can use and not get a mouth full of cankers! i have been out for a while, and immediately broke out again!</li>
    <li> This tooth paste is not as good as what I used to get. I like the Canker Sore tooth paste much better for canker Sore control</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve searched high and low for toothpaste that the whole family can use, that is gentle for our sensitive mouths. My husband and children all get canker sores with regular store-bought toothpaste, but never with Rembrandt! This stuff is a lifesaver!</li>
    <li> I switched to Rembrandt to avoid sodium laurel sulphate since I get frequent canker sores in my mouth. But this brand didn&#x27;t do a good job at removing the tarter. I switched to Biotene and am much happier.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your mouth feeling like it&#x27;s been power washed with strong chemicals but it cleans effectively. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this gentle toothpaste for years now and I can truly say that it has kept me from having canker sores. Before finding this product I suffered terribly with them. I like the convenience of getting it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I am working toward making my life LSL free and this toothpaste is part of that. I get cold sores, always have, and using and LSL free toothpaste is shown to help the frequency of the outbreaks. I am just happy to be putting one less chemical in my body.</li>
    <li> With burning mouth syndrome, I am highly sensitive to taste and most toothpastes are much too strong for me, including this one. I could not use it and do not recommend it, though it&#x27;s not as strong as some toothpastes.</li>
    <li> As a kid, I suffered mightily from canker sores and ever since I discoved this toothpast about 10 years ago, my instances of canker sores has decreased 75% and their severity a like amount.  If you suffer from canker sores, this may very well help.  It sure did for me.</li>
    <li> Love this gentle alternative to super foamy toothpastes.  My only complaint is the tube cap...not always the easiest to put back on.</li>
