      <li>As I get older, and my skin gets drier, I&#x27;ve found that Neutrogena Body Oil is the best thing to use after a shower.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this wonderful oil.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super light, smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes.  </li>

      <li>The scent is unique but pleasant.</li>
      <li>And how much more effective it is to use the after-bath oil than just an moisturizer by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was looking for something like that but even more effective, but this doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>

      <li>I love Neutrogena products and decided to try this.  </li>
      <li>It works just OK during the shower.  </li>
      <li>, I find it works much better when I use it in the bath.  </li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s the fact that it has more time to penetrate into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This is especially evident when you&#x27;re moving around and your body starts to heat up.</li>
      <li>I love the smell.</li>

      <li>The smells is so nice and light.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>

      <li>As a bonus, it has the most heavenly scent (does not smell like cooking oil, I promise)</li>
      <li>When the product was opened the top was cracked and the cover was ripped off</li>
      <li>A product that my family and I have used for many years now.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I had to slather me with it a couple times a day, but it allowed me to function almost as if my skin was healthy.  </li>
      <li>so I may be able to end my dependence soon.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff - use it all the time.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice light scented oil that can be used as a massage oil or put into bathwater.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>

      <li>It actually has a very pleasant smell.  </li>
      <li>Very nice, a good fix for dry skin.</li>
      <li>Other wise, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a great product for those who can tolerate the ingredients.</li>
      <li>(Happily, I am responding to a new medication for my psoriasis</li>
      <li>I also love the sme is not so strong and can go with your perfume without interrupting the perfume smell..</li>
      <li>I love the smell, the way it softens my skin and the fact that is so easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>Nuetrogena Body Oil is the best body oil for my skin type (dry in winter).</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how to describe it except to say that it is a clean calm pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>The price is comparable to that big box store but free shipping through Amazon Prime is the best!</li>
      <li>and my skin smells great and is very soft.</li>
      <li>Very light scent and makes my skin so smooth.</li>
      <li>BTW, I check other sources to purchase this and Amazon is still the best most of the time.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
      <li>Okay, this stuff is fabulous.  </li>
      <li>Love the smell and how light it is.</li>
      <li>Soft skin, great scent.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff it leaves my skin so smooth and Absorbs into my skin</li>
      <li>Love it - makes skin feel silky smooth.</li>
      <li>I love this lightly sesame oil.  </li>
      <li>I love the scent, my skin feels so smooth, without feeling greasy,  and it absorbs well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>KEEPS SKIN SOFT AND SMELLS GREAT.</li>
      <li>Take it from a nice skin junkie, this is definitely worth</li>
      <li>Nice gentle aroma, easy on skin!  </li>
      <li>I l really like the pleasant light sesame fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I love the fresh, very light, scent.</li>
      <li>Never a bad buy!</li>
      <li>Itch free, soft skin, happy lady.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s easy to use, saves me time in the morning, and keeps me moisturized all day.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave residue and absorbs into your skin very quickly while still retaining moisture.</li>
      <li>I also like it much better than baby oil because it is more easily absorbed (because it is sesame, and not mineral oil)</li>
      <li>It goes on easily</li>
      <li>Easy on the hands, but will stain sheets.  </li>
      <li>I love this product It smells so good and makes your skin feel so soft.</li>
      <li>I know that stretch marks are more genetic than anything else, but so far so good.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used it in a while, so I was thrilled to get it for such a good price.  </li>
      <li>Very pleasant mild scent, has done wonders as daily after shower moisturizer</li>
      <li>Works beautifully to keep moisture in after a shower, absorbs almost instantly.  </li>
      <li>At first I thought the smell was nice.  </li>
      <li>After a warm bath, blot excess water off your skin and apply a generous amount of the Neutrogena Body Oil to your skin and it really helps!    </li>
      <li>I have been fanatical about my skin for over twenty years, and this is the best product I&#x27;ve tried hands down.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quick easy and refreshing</li>
      <li>i have tattoos and it keeps the colors looking bright and new.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just fine</li>
      <li>, it goes on smoothly and is easy to blend in.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps if is smelled nutty like sesame oil, it would be fine, but it has a perfume in it.  </li>
      <li>If your skin is still quite damp it dries even more quickly.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like the scent of the other body oils I tried, but this is very pleasant.</li>
      <li>This is lighter than coconut oil and is better absorbed more quickly.  </li>
      <li>My favorite body oil in the whole world, it has a really great smell, it leaves your skin very soft and smooth&amp;#62; i have been using this product for years</li>
      <li>Very light, soaks right in to your skin.</li>
      <li>I am on day one of using and it&#x27;s made a huge difference already.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge Neutrogena fan and was perusing their products on Amazon when I stumbled across this.</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin conditioned and smooth</li>
      <li>When the product is fresh, it is outstanding.</li>
      <li>I wish I had bought the fragrance free version of this product.  </li>
      <li>Tried this sesame oil using a cheap spray bottle-</li>
      <li>I use to use this years ago, and now I remember way.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a light scented moisturizer after shower or bath.</li>
      <li>w/Neutrogena&#x27;s light products.  </li>
      <li>It has a light orange blossom scent.</li>
      <li>my body is smooth and comfortable..</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice this wasn&#x27;t fragrance free.</li>
      <li>I use this with Neutrogena body lotion light sesame lotion.</li>

      <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think I would like oil instead of lotion, but this is fantastic.</li>
      <li>light scent that fades in no time at all and no one else can smell it.</li>
      <li>I rarely use it and it isn&#x27;t cheap!</li>
      <li>Lightly scented.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and doesnt take alot of it.</li>
      <li>This product has a fantastic ability to wick through cotton, permanently bind to the fibers, and turn yellow-brown.</li>
      <li>Wish the 40 ounce size was still available</li>
      <li>Light smell.</li>
      <li>It keeps my skin smooth and f</li>
      <li>and it soaks in and leaves my skin feeling so smooth, but not greasy.</li>
      <li>You smooth it on, towel if off, and follow up with a moisturizing cream.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m dropping a star from my review solely because I&#x27;d prefer an oil that wasn&#x27;t scented (the wife likes the Light Sesame smell..</li>
      <li>Makes your skin feel fantastic.  </li>
      <li>its fabulous.</li>
      <li>No sticky but smooth</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize that this was not the fragrance free type.</li>
      <li>It is so light that it&#x27;s almost non-existent.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite - just the right amount of scent to it.</li>
      <li>I love the smell, and you can put on clothes right away.</li>
      <li>I recommend this product to anyone with dry skin problems or who justs want to maintain their healthy skin with a pleasantly scented body oil.</li>
      <li>Love it, have loved it for a long time.  </li>
      <li>Quick and easy to put on after I shower.</li>
      <li>, I love the large bottle it comes in, it has a great flip top that makes it easy to use, without making a huge oily mess.  </li>
      <li>Light scent and works great for dry skin.</li>
      <li>It glides over the skin easily and is absorbed comfortable.</li>
      <li>I use this right after I shower and love that it&#x27;s clear, light, and has a nice fragrance.  </li>
      <li>As an added bonus, I noticed a surgery scar has faded and softened significantly since I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
      <li>i was sooo excited..</li>
      <li>and i rarely moisturize!....</li>
      <li>I love to take a really hot bath</li>
      <li>Great price for the big bottle here on Amazon, and it will last a once-a-day user  a good</li>
      <li>This is a nice light oil, with a very subdued smell that is well absorbed.  </li>
      <li>Worth every cent!</li>
      <li>Then I rub the oil in small amounts and my skin is in perfect condition every day.  </li>
      <li>This past winter though, I layered it under my thicker lotions and my skin felt wonderful.</li>
      <li>The mild aroma is pleasant especially for those who have allergies to strong odors.  </li>
      <li>This body oil is super greasy and not really easy to wash off which makes it perfect for extra-dry skin.</li>
      <li>use it all the time great for dry skin.</li>
      <li>A light mildly fragrant oil.</li>
      <li>This is so soft and just soaks into your skin and smells nice and light.  </li>

      <li>Love the oil and isn&#x27;t too &#x27;perfumey&#x27;...it&#x27;s more of natural spice scent, not flowery and obnoxious...</li>
      <li>Great for dry winter skin with out feeling greasy.</li>
      <li>Love this body oil for when we do back rubs, have been using this kind for years, will keep buying</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and my skin feels smooth and no dryness.  </li>
      <li>very light non-gender type aroma with great moisturizing quality - natural and light enough to apply to hair without being greasy</li>
      <li>I have very dry skin and tried this after all the great reviews.  </li>
      <li>Makes my skin sooo smooth and moisturized (I have very dry skin) and it smells absolutely amazing!  </li>
      <li>Hard to find in stores but moisturizers wonderfully.  </li>
      <li>There is no real smell either, which is great.</li>
      <li>Stops itchy skin and great for rough hands, elbows.  </li>
      <li>Huge bottle lasts a long time and is a good value as a result.  </li>
      <li>So much better than using baby oil, much lighter.</li>
      <li>I like to use a cap full in a bath.</li>
      <li>The light fragrance is fresh and clea.</li>
      <li>it really works, and smells divine, but is not obnoxious, I dislike fragrance in lotions, but love this one .</li>
      <li>Smells great and the price is far better than finding this product at a local retailer.</li>
      <li>This oil not only feels good</li>
      <li>Just feel nice and soft all day.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a tried and true.</li>
      <li>this is a light oil that I like to apply while I&#x27;m still wet from my shower/bath - that&#x27;s all I need for the warm months and in the colder weather I used it as a top coat after I apply a thicker body butter.  </li>
      <li>A nice soft scent too.  </li>
      <li>My daughter called the next day to find out what I put on her because she loved the smell.</li>
      <li>also do not like wearing perfume, so the light, shower fresh scent of this oil</li>
      <li>The light sesame scent smells so fresh.  </li>
      <li>Not bad,</li>
      <li>Smells great, and it doesn&#x27;t leave your body feeling to oily like other products.  </li>
      <li>The product arrived quickly and as described.  </li>
      <li>Thank you for sending it so quickly and as described</li>
      <li>The scent is mild</li>
      <li>When I found out I was pregnant.</li>
      <li>mild, sensual fragrance.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It works wonderfully... for 10 minutes, but as soon as I stepped outside I could feel my skin drying and starting to peel..</li>
      <li>She used it to help prevent stretch marks while she was pregnant.</li>
      <li>I not only love the results, but I also love the feel of this body oil as well as the smell.</li>
      <li>It is also not oily and dries quickly..</li>
      <li>Super and well-priced</li>
      <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>My skin absorbs this rather quickly so my legs begin to peel by the evening if I have shaven.</li>
      <li>Light enough to even use in warm weather.</li>
      <li>A lovely, after shower addition, which leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Luckily, the oil hadn&#x27;t leaked out and gotten all over, but it does make storage kind of obnoxious right now, so I&#x27;m going to have to steal a cap from an old shampoo bottle or something to replace this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is great to put on right after a shower/bath, when you are still wet and don&#x27;t want to chaff or become ashy.</li>
      <li>Has the original sesame smell (like the clear amber soap bars) that I love.</li>
      <li>Nice neutral smell, barely noticeable.  </li>
      <li>I have always loved this body/bath oil, it has been around forever, &amp; I will use it as long as I am around!</li>
      <li>This is an easy &amp; fast fix</li>
      <li>Really good for my dry skin.</li>
      <li>It is easy to rub in and it does not stay oily when you rub it in really well.</li>
      <li>This product is hands down, the most effective I have ever found at ruining sheets.</li>
      <li>I would have given it 5 stars, but the bottle really needs a pump!!</li>
      <li>I liked it better than putting petroleum based products on my skin and the previous version worked well.</li>
      <li>which i am sure played a role..like many of you out there with dry skin</li>
      <li>I am English and used to be able to buy it like this and in an atomiser for easy dispersing.</li>
      <li>Wonderful product, just enough moisture to keep your skin from being dry.  </li>
      <li>My skin is smooth, supple and has a type of glow to it in certain types of lights</li>
      <li>Fast, soaks right into your skin, easy.  </li>
      <li>I would whole heartedly suggest this product as a light oil body cover.</li>
      <li>Has a great scent to it, nothing too strong just subtle.</li>
      <li>The product is good, but be careful of the price.</li>
      <li>This product lubricates and is absorbed by the skin, making it feel and look healthier.</li>
      <li>Just a different kind of hassle than going to the store.</li>
      <li>i wanted to start moisturizing since i rarely do.</li>
      <li>love it keep myself soft</li>
      <li>I love the soft smell of this fragrance..</li>
      <li>but if you know what biosilk silk therapy smells like, this is that same kind of scent.</li>
      <li>It is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>I mix this with my regular lotion to make a nice silky feel</li>
      <li>Soft and luminous skin effect, love this product</li>
      <li>Same old great product I&#x27;ve used for decades.</li>
      <li>I have had many compliments on the softness of my skin over the years, from people who seem simply amazed that my skin can be so smooth and soft!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but it is well worth it.</li>
      <li>Right after the shower, just rub some on your body and most of the day, you will be moisturized and soft.  </li>
      <li>first learned of Neutrogena Light Sesame Body Oil from an article in a magazine about the personal favorite products of beauty profesionals.</li>
      <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t move me one way or the other, but people tell me I smell good</li>
      <li>Have used lots of other lotions etc., but find this extremely good.</li>
      <li>Light, absorbs quickly, moisturizes, skin looks and smells great all day, and also blends with other fragrances easily if you are a perfume wearer (I&#x27;m not, but have friends who do layer this with other scents).  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newly devoted customer right here.  </li>
      <li>I apply this immediately after drying off from the shower, and it soaks right in without feeling greasy.  </li>
      <li>I rub it on my body right before I&#x27;m about to get out of the shower.</li>
      <li>I put it on right out of the shower</li>
      <li>Soaks right in and does not get on clothes.</li>
      <li>and I put it on right after my shower .  </li>
      <li>This oil leaves such a soft feeling and amazing smell!</li>
      <li>The oil was mentioned several times as a tried and true after-bath or shower moisturizer for even the driest or most problematic skins.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love, love, love for my extra dry skin!</li>
      <li>I read about 100 reviews on here and they were all super positive, so I went ahead</li>
      <li>I have fragile , baby fine hair after having chemotherapy for breast cancer some years ago , and this seems like a good extra moisturizer to help protect my hair as I sleep.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
      <li>Keeps skin perfectly hydrated and takes less time to apply than regular lotion.</li>
      <li>Doesnt hydrate as much as I would expect oil to do so, but its gentle and glides on easily after a shower.</li>
      <li>Just leaves a silky soft finish on your skin, not on your clothes, great for dry winter skin.</li>
      <li>I liked the weight of the oil, it wasn&#x27;t too heavy, but the scent was way too strong for me.  </li>
      <li>After sitting for a day the smell turned out to be musky , sweet and very sensual.  </li>
      <li>It has a subtle sesame scent, I just loved it!</li>
      <li>It is light and silky smooth not heavy and greasy where the first thing the person wants is to &amp;#34;get</li>
      <li>The smell reminds of me of rich old ladies with lovely skin, which I&#x27;m completely here for.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Use this as a &amp;#34;carrier oil&amp;#34; as it is so light and really penetrates the dermis very well.</li>
      <li>Good quality but kind of expensive.</li>
      <li>, they say I have a scent and a few people have gotten attached to it, so on some subconscious level, it must be nice to get a whiff of!  :)</li>
      <li>I do also use this at times on my fully dry skin, and it&#x27;s still great, just a little more oily feeling at first.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>It smells so very clean and is not heavy, absorbing without residue.</li>
      <li>The oil itself is nice; I used it in combination with a body cream for these very dry winter months.</li>
      <li>Lovely subtle scent; nice oil.</li>
      <li>and there is just no other product that I love as much.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who is wants to keep their skin looking fabulous.</li>
      <li>When used together, my skin stays soft and smooth even during the coldest winters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad I finally bought this.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t American corporations just give us what is healthy and stop poisoning us?</li>
      <li>have sensitive skin &amp;amp; therefore I&#x27;m really comfortable</li>
      <li>my skin feels soft and smooth without feeling greasy (I can get dressed immediately).</li>
      <li>i highly recommend this product for those suffering the itch!!</li>
      <li>I have tried many different moisturizers/ oils</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve ever used baby oil on you skin, then you already know exactly what this will be like.  </li>
      <li>On first day I told my husband it  smelled like turpentine.  </li>
      <li>Pretty much eliminates itching!</li>
      <li>Just after a shower, rub in wet warm skin.</li>
      <li>the price is divine also, and a lot more than I got from the local store.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend!!</li>
      <li>dryness, soothes legs after shaving, makes my décolletage look younger , smooths over any stretch marks, makes skin feel sexy and well</li>
      <li>Used in or out of the shower it leaves the skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Makes your skin so soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Before I get out of the shower, it turn the water on HOT..</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for several years and love the product.  </li>
      <li>no fake , over powering perfumey smell.</li>
      <li>I saw this online and thought I would give it a try since the reviews seem to be pretty good.&lt;br</li>
      <li>And she is more than picky about her products, especially for skin care.  </li>
      <li>I will read more carefully next time.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, especially during winter weather.</li>
      <li>I love this body oil and use it daily.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried lotions and creams, but nothing really seemed to do the job right. ..</li>
      <li>A 32oz pump bottle of Neutrogena Light Sesame Body Oil sits on the ledge of my bath tub right next to my other very favorite bath/shower product.....</li>
      <li>This is a tried and true product that works better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very natural scent, which I have also gotten compliments on, as people simply think I smell good naturally, so</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several methods from using it right in the shower to toweling off LIGHTLY and apply this afterward.</li>
      <li>It is light, absorbs quickly, and leaves skin, well, luminous -- not exactly shiny, since it is absorbed well, but sort of shimmery (</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used it immediately after the shower (without toweling off real quick) and I&#x27;ve used it after a quickly towel down (but still had some water on my skin).  </li>
      <li>Works great on my dry skin in my dry climate.  </li>
      <li>The scent is nice going on, then fades and is very subtle, although I do think when I renew, I&#x27;ll get the unscented just to be sure it&#x27;s not competing with my perfume.</li>
      <li>Neutrogena Body Oil is an excellent, long lasting formula that both facilitates healing (of dry skin) and promotes skin enhancement (improvement in complexion).</li>
      <li>I have noticed that this product makes my skin more dry then moisturizering it.</li>
      <li>However, even when I tried it with the matching lotion on top, it still did not fully hydrate my dry skin.  </li>
      <li>Leaves me feeling super soft.</li>
      <li>I did notice at the bottom of the bottle there was a small dent that I was able to smooth  out  </li>
      <li>and like many have mentioned i do use lotion afterwards, i prefer Olay body cream oil for dry skin for a body lotion..</li>
      <li>Leaves me with super soft skin all day.</li>
      <li>I used to have keratosis pilarsis on the backs of my arms - those dry bumps that form, most often on the arms.  </li>
      <li>Ideally, you rub it on while you are still damp, but I refer to dry off a little bit.  </li>
      <li>I used to purchase the large size of this from this store and when the stores no longer carried it, I found it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>It certainly wouldn&#x27;t interrupt any perfume or cologne you would put on.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know why people said it is not greasy, b/c it certainly is greasy.  </li>
      <li>The price has certainly has gone up since I bought it years ago......</li>
      <li>I was really hoping the scent would be similar to RAIN BATH, but it is not - bit strong for my taste.</li>
      <li>My husband and I both use this body oil - love the scent, it really helps keep the flaky dry skin under control.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a classic for a reason!</li>
      <li>It helps you to stay a little bit warm.  </li>
      <li>Smells nice, keeps your skin moisturized and doesn&#x27;t require a lot as a small amount works very, very well.</li>
      <li>This body oil works really well.</li>
      <li>The price was reasonable.  </li>
      <li>Also real bang for the buck.</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t want me or my boyfriend smelling like my grandma.  </li>
      <li>really???</li>
      <li>My whole family uses this body oil except for me</li>
      <li>But will order fragrance free next time.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>but it was obviously fragrance free.</li>
      <li>It really moisturizes and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
      <li>Soaks in fairly fast, so you can get dressed soon after.  </li>
      <li>I put it on just after a shower when I&#x27;m still wet, then put lotion on over the top of it to seal it in.  </li>
      <li>Especially good for cold weather climates and after gym workout.  </li>
      <li>I have used this for years, and now in my 50&#x27;s really need it  in the NW.  </li>
      <li>Your lips will feel extra sensitive and a combination of incense from the sesame oil and your partner&#x27;s own natural smell will combine into an intense desireable fragrance.</li>
      <li>I sometimes mix this together with my regular body lotion that is in a pump dispenser for that satin smooth feel.</li>
      <li>I actually smooth what is left on my hands into my hair after a nightly shower, to retain moisture and make hair feel silkier.  </li>
      <li>My go to moisturizer straight after a shower.  </li>
      <li>I have used this for years and really appreciate it after shaving.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to my fellow ladies!</li>
      <li>Too much bother to return</li>
      <li>I have really always had it -</li>
      <li>Next time I&#x27;ll try the fragrance-free one if it&#x27;s available.</li>
      <li>Skin is very moisturized.  </li>
      <li>This body oil really helped overcome a lot of that.  </li>
      <li>The smell is OK just not what I expected.  </li>
      <li>This bottle lasts much longer than one thinks as one</li>
      <li>I use this after I shower and it moisturizers really well</li>
      <li>I need to use it more often, but with this big old bottle now I can.</li>
      <li>That being said, I do use more than \\&quot;a few drops\\&quot; when I apply, but still, it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
      <li>that lingers pleasantly but subtly.   </li>
      <li>I keep the oil right by the shower, and it keeps my skin soft.</li>
      <li>Love the mild scent + the oil absorbs relatively quickly and does not leave behind a residue.  </li>
      <li>I used it for the first time yesterday, and I have to say that it did leave my skin feeling very soft and well-moisturized.</li>
      <li>It also has a slight aroma to it, just enough to be pleasant.</li>
      <li>Tried many other types.  </li>
      <li>Its great because a little bit goes a long way and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;- Smells great when applying and stays consistent throughout the day (just a little less intense as the day goes on of course)</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who might enjoy a new scent with their moisturizer.</li>
      <li>If I was asked to pick my favorite beauty product, Neutrogena body oil would be the hands down winner.  </li>
      <li>Great for my skin too, especially during long dry winters.</li>
      <li>I live in the southwest and my skin really dries out in the winter.</li>
      <li>Once dry, your skin is silky smooth but not oily.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft and smooth, I don&#x27;t itch from the dryness, and my legs are no longer white with flaking skin!  </li>
      <li>I get more compliments on this product than I do many of my expensive perfumes.</li>
      <li>and it definitely moisturizes the skin adequately.</li>
      <li>I purchased this at Amazon for my wife after our local drug store quick carrying it.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I highly recommed this product..</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend this body oil.  </li>
      <li>Leaves me skin so soft !!</li>
      <li>It is VERY floral, reminding me of old ladies perfumes from the 1960&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Keeps my skin soft for the whole day.  </li>
      <li>It does work very well, but it gives me and anyone standing near me a headache from the smell.  </li>
      <li>I want to start by explaining that I really don&#x27;t wear perfume or body spray because I&#x27;m so sensitive to the chemical</li>
      <li>On it&#x27;s own, it is not effective.  </li>
      <li>and it instantly get absorbed into my skin and</li>
      <li>I do my normal shower routine and</li>
      <li>This is one of the few scented products I have been able to use.  </li>
      <li>Much better than baby oil if you put it on Freshly dried off skin.  </li>
      <li>That was several years and many bottles ago, and I haven&#x27;t had a dry skin problem since.  </li>
      <li>So, that&#x27;s why I will quickly towel down first, then apply.  </li>
      <li>I have very dry skin and tried many different creams and lotions, which wasn&#x27;t doing it for me any longer.  </li>
      <li>It has a light fragrance that doesn&#x27;t interfere with other perfumes I may wear.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without this oil.  </li>
      <li>Probably going to buy a new bottle to put it in.</li>
      <li>I live on this stuff all through the winter.</li>
      <li>I live in Australia and this product is not availble at all.</li>
      <li>Rather than using preservatives in the oil, would rather risk it going rancid at which time I would just toss it away and buy new.</li>
      <li>My new sheets were hideously stained after one use.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without this stuff, use it every time I shower or bathe.  </li>
      <li>and it made my skin super dry.</li>
      <li>My legs get so dry in the winter and this helps tremendously.  </li>
      <li>a little oil after your shower can make you more comfortable, and may draw your wife in a little closer..</li>
      <li>It makes my skin very soft.</li>
      <li>Leaves skin very soft.</li>
      <li>Totally keeps skin soft - use it right out of the shower.</li>
      <li>I use after shower before drying off, then my regular body lotion, makes my skin super soft and leaves a nice scent behind (if you like the smell that is, also comes unscented).</li>
      <li>Makes my skin so soft!</li>
      <li>Beware if you are sensitive to odors!</li>
      <li>nearly 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ha!</li>
      <li>I added a pump to my bottle and it is more efficient and no more drips.</li>
      <li>and I get compliments on how soft my skin is all the time!  </li>
      <li>right before I turn off the water, I smooth a little of this on my back, arms, legs, etc.....</li>
      <li>If I dry myself off too much and wait too long to apply the oil, I just lightly dampen my skin and then apply the oil.</li>
      <li>sesame oils available at Whole Foods and other places locally.  </li>
      <li>Also, the bottle is huge, so I anticipate it lasting quite a long while.</li>
      <li>Light, absorbs quickly, no stickiness, and smells move too,  I have used it for years.  </li>
      <li>slippery.&lt;br /&gt;Can be applied over wet, damp, or dry skin with outstanding results.&lt;br /&gt;Combats</li>
      <li>Right after a shower before I dry off, I apply oil and then towel off</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just as good if not better than the other name brand oils on the market today.</li>
      <li>I enjoy the smell and sometimes add a little to my hair.</li>
      <li>The price is decent and it lasts a long time as you don&#x27;t need to use too much each day.</li>
      <li>Love this oil hard to find in stores.</li>
      <li>Be careful on ordering, I noticed that on one offer page switching from 8.5 ounces fragrance free to 16 ounces suddenly changes to this unbearable fully fragrant variety.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy and absorbs into my skin, keeping it soft.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt that when I used it immediately after showering it didn&#x27;t absorb completely.  </li>
      <li>I put it on after a shower and my skin still feels soft in the evening.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind the natural smell of sesame oil.  </li>
      <li>but I have an old one I keep refilling.</li>
      <li>Now everyone in my family is soft to the touch...</li>
      <li>Smells like old ladies.</li>
      <li>Immediately makes you skin soft and absorbs into it.</li>
      <li>I still my old bottle of Neutrogena body oil</li>
      <li>but I tend to become sensitive to fragrances.</li>
      <li>I used it one time after a shower and went straight back to my Curel moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it but what I read so far doesn&#x27;t make me want to buy it.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  </li>
      <li>Keeps my skin soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
      <li>I would see this at my local drug stores all the time, but I felt it cost to much.  </li>
      <li>I even i apply to my 2 year old daughter after the shower..</li>
      <li>I use this after each shower and it makes my skin feel particularly soft - even in winter months.  </li>
      <li>THE SMELL IS SO &#x27;SOFT&#x27;</li>
      <li>I have to mention that i have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>so if you have sensitive skin don&#x27;t buy it ..</li>
      <li>it leaves .my skin feeling soft with no oily feeling.</li>
      <li>I have tried cheaper brands, and they work well, but Neutrogena by far is my favourite.  </li>
      <li>Cortizone cream helped, but then I started getting very itchy spots on my legs, back, etc.  </li>
      <li>Makes my skin feel soft w/o being oily.</li>
      <li>Nothing more to say really, except that you should consider transferring it to a clean pump bottle to control how much you use at a time; the bottle it comes in is a little difficult to use.</li>
      <li>A little bit goes a long way and this large bottle will keep you silky smooth for months.  </li>
      <li>I use it on my wet skin right after a shower or bath.....</li>
      <li>I have pretty sever dry skin &amp; eczema in winter...</li>
      <li>Living in AZ is pretty dry and lotions don&#x27;t rehydrate my skin after showering like this</li>
      <li>As usual, Neutrogena knows their stuff and this product comes easily recommended.</li>
      <li>[[ASIN:B000BRXWKM Vitabath Moisturizing Bath &amp; Shower Gelee, Original Spring Green]].</li>
      <li>We use to buy this at the local store but found they don&#x27;t carry it in the 16oz size anymore which is the better buy and half the time you can only find &amp;#34;scent free&amp;#34;,  my husband loves the scent as he puts it &amp;</li>
      <li>I started using this last winter when my skin was so dry from the cold weather - and it works beautifully!  </li>
      <li>I much prefer toweling off a bit first, then putting it on, then I let it dry for a moment while I dry my hair and wrap it up.  </li>
      <li>I step out of the shower and immediately put a light coating all over while I&#x27;m still wet before toweling dry.  </li>
      <li>The oil is quickly absorbed into the skin, almost nothing is left on the towel used to dry yourself.</li>
      <li>Usually I use this in the summer because it&#x27;s so light, but covers well.  </li>
      <li>We also use the Neutrogena Moisture Rich Body Wash (the dark blue color).  </li>
      <li>The pop up top lends to the oil running down the side of the bottle and on to the vanity or other surface, and from your hands to the bottle again.&lt;br</li>
      <li>(I put some in a spritz bottle for those harder to reach places on my back) and is quickly absorbed.</li>
      <li>The product is good but it came with the lid broken, so I have to be careful with it or it will leak everywhere.</li>
      <li>The combination of this oil and lotion keeps my body very soft; especially in winter months.</li>
      <li>my hands, feet, elbows and any other area that I think could use a little more softening and smoothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Purchased by word of mouth and no regrets!</li>
      <li>This stuff is so amazing that even if it was the worse smelling product in the world I would still use it!</li>
      <li>It really keeps my skin from getting real dry during the winter.  </li>
      <li>The smell takes me back to my young days on the beach.</li>
      <li>boyfriend constantly raving about my soft skin.</li>
      <li>also just for a complete understanding of my skin regimen, i exfoliated with burts bess sugar scrub prior to shower and then applied the body oil;</li>
      <li>It has kept my skin baby soft and looking years younger than my age.  </li>
      <li>Because if it can do that to my sheets, it can do that to your shirts, your pants, and your bed-linen if you oil yourself up and go to bed without putting a rubber mat down first.</li>
      <li>But my parents use it everyday and we even order in bulk when we go on vacation because we give them out to our extended family since they can&#x27;t really get this product where they live.</li>
      <li>Then they crack open and the new tissue under them tears open.  </li>
      <li>The fall/winter weather has me in aisles buying every lotion available to quench my ultra dry skin, nothing is working that doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy grease after feel.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very subtle, not greasy at all, very light.</li>
      <li>I was not able to purchase it in the retail stores, but was lucky to find it in Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I thought an oil would be extremely moisturizing, but my skin didn&#x27;t feel or look very hydrated at all.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too bad, since it is actually very moisturizing and gave my skin a nice sheen.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is delicate and clean and not cloying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Keeps your skin nice and soft during all of these cold winter days and nights.</li>
      <li>(I have very sensitive dry</li>
      <li>It can be messy pouring it right out of the 16-ounce bottle, so I pour some into a smaller container that I refill after it&#x27;s used up.</li>
      <li>But, I do have very severe psoriasis (the clinical diagnosis is &#x27;extreme psoriasis&#x27; actually).  </li>
      <li>It makes a difference as you age and skin begins to be less elastic and does not produce as much oil.  </li>
      <li>It goes on and absorbs quickly leaving behind soft glowing skin and a subtle light fragrance that reminds me of the beach (suntan lotion and jasmine mixed with sand).</li>
      <li>but they are so thick that I go through them quickly.</li>
      <li>not dreading the old inevitable itch that is associated with extremely dry skin..</li>
      <li>After applying, let dry for a few minutes and to be absorbed.  </li>
      <li>Well, after several more trips back to the islands and with very few bites, I continue to use this product year round.  </li>
      <li>Will leave your skin silky smooth after a shower, with a very delicate scent.  </li>

<li> Love it!</li>
<li> I love this product!</li>

<li> It will be nice if the bottle says scented.</li>
<li> nice after-bath oil.</li>
<li> I bought this with the hope of a nice, non-greasy option for massage.  </li>
<li> Nice to apply after a bath, but you can also put some on the tub when relaxing.</li>
<li> Smells nice too.</li>
<li> The nice part about this oil is that once applied it does not stay oily to the touch or on clothing.  </li>
<li> It has a nice smell also.  </li>
<li> not that it has mica or any kind of makeup stuff in it).  </li>
<li> It has a nice scent my husband loves.</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve always loved this formulation, but haven&#x27;t used it in many years.</li>
<li> The smell is light and delicious and it goes on so smoothly.  </li>
<li> Not an effective moisturizer (for me, anyway).</li>
<li> It feels and smells perfectly nice.</li>
<li> This is great not that many stores carry this now and the ones that do sell it for alot more.</li>
<li> Because I liked the texture of the oil I used it for a treatment... once.</li>

<li> I highly recommend this wonderful oil.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s super light, smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes.  </li>

<li> but it smells great and absorbs quickly</li>
<li> It spreads very easily.</li>
<li> This oil has a very strong chemical</li>
<li> It smells nice and its great for right when you get outta the shower.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s surprising to see how quickly the oil works!</li>
<li> The scent is unique but pleasant.</li>
<li> And how much more effective it is to use the after-bath oil than just an moisturizer by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I was looking for something like that but even more effective, but this doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
<li> Good for light wintertime moisture.</li>
<li> so this stuff is suitable.</li>
<li> The scent is nice too :)</li>
<li> Excellent for sensitive skin.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s light and smells good, but it doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue.  </li>

<li> , i begin to miss this oil very quickly!</li>
<li> Love, love, love!</li>
<li> It smells great and if you put it on before you dry off after a shower or bath, it seems to seal in moisture and make you feel good because you know you smell good.</li>

<li> good moisturizer in winter for after-shower use.  not bad scent.  </li>

<li> Love returning to this product and the scent.</li>

<li> and I LOVE it.</li>
<li> Could be more moisturizing but supplementing with a heavier lotion on elbows and knees.</li>

<li> Love it.</li>

<li> I absolutely love this product as do the 10-12 people I have shared it with.</li>
<li> It also does well for preventing a lot of the static cling that seems to happen in our blustery winter weather.</li>
<li> Nice light oil for moisturizing skin after bath.</li>
<li> I love Neutrogena products and decided to try this.  </li>
<li> It works just OK during the shower.  </li>
<li> , I find it works much better when I use it in the bath.  </li>
<li> Maybe it&#x27;s the fact that it has more time to penetrate into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> This is especially evident when you&#x27;re moving around and your body starts to heat up.</li>
<li> I love the smell.</li>
<li> Its my favorite bed time routine.</li>
<li> The smells is so nice and light.</li>
<li> I love it.</li>
<li> I love this moisturizer and have been using it for 15 years.</li>
<li> As a bonus, it has the most heavenly scent (does not smell like cooking oil, I promise)</li>
<li> When the product was opened the top was cracked and the cover was ripped off</li>
<li> A product that my family and I have used for many years now.</li>
<li> Love this product.</li>
<li> I had to slather me with it a couple times a day, but it allowed me to function almost as if my skin was healthy.  </li>
<li> so I may be able to end my dependence soon.  </li>
<li> I love this stuff - use it all the time.  </li>
<li> This is a nice light scented oil that can be used as a massage oil or put into bathwater.</li>

<li> and I just love it.</li>
<li> I love it, but I still would not buy it at the drugstore for their price.</li>
<li> I hope it is better.  </li>
<li> Also it helps increase sexual attraction and an overwhelming feeling of calmness and serenety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kiss</li>
<li> Works like magic after a shower.</li>
<li> and my skin is more moist and is looking healthier.</li>

<li> very well makes my skin look very nice</li>
<li> So far so good this winter!</li>
<li> It actually has a very pleasant smell.  </li>
<li> Very nice, a good fix for dry skin.</li>
<li> Other wise, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a great product for those who can tolerate the ingredients.</li>
<li> (Happily, I am responding to a new medication for my psoriasis</li>
<li> I also love the sme is not so strong and can go with your perfume without interrupting the perfume smell..</li>
<li> I love the smell, the way it softens my skin and the fact that is so easy to apply.  </li>
<li> Nuetrogena Body Oil is the best body oil for my skin type (dry in winter).</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know how to describe it except to say that it is a clean calm pleasant scent.</li>
<li> The price is comparable to that big box store but free shipping through Amazon Prime is the best!</li>
<li> and my skin smells great and is very soft.</li>
<li> Very light scent and makes my skin so smooth.</li>
<li> BTW, I check other sources to purchase this and Amazon is still the best most of the time.</li>
<li> I love this stuff and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
<li> Okay, this stuff is fabulous.  </li>

<li> I love this lightly sesame oil.  </li>
<li> I love the scent, my skin feels so smooth, without feeling greasy,  and it absorbs well.&lt;br</li>
<li> KEEPS SKIN SOFT AND SMELLS GREAT.</li>
<li> Take it from a nice skin junkie, this is definitely worth</li>
<li> Nice gentle aroma, easy on skin!  </li>
<li> I l really like the pleasant light sesame fragrance.  </li>
<li> I love the fresh, very light, scent.</li>
<li> Never a bad buy!</li>
<li> Itch free, soft skin, happy lady.</li>
<li> , it&#x27;s easy to use, saves me time in the morning, and keeps me moisturized all day.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t leave residue and absorbs into your skin very quickly while still retaining moisture.</li>
<li> I also like it much better than baby oil because it is more easily absorbed (because it is sesame, and not mineral oil)</li>
<li> It goes on easily</li>
<li> Easy on the hands, but will stain sheets.  </li>
<li> I love this product It smells so good and makes your skin feel so soft.</li>
<li> I know that stretch marks are more genetic than anything else, but so far so good.</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t used it in a while, so I was thrilled to get it for such a good price.  </li>
<li> Very pleasant mild scent, has done wonders as daily after shower moisturizer</li>
<li> Works beautifully to keep moisture in after a shower, absorbs almost instantly.  </li>
<li> At first I thought the smell was nice.  </li>
<li> After a warm bath, blot excess water off your skin and apply a generous amount of the Neutrogena Body Oil to your skin and it really helps!    </li>
<li> I have been fanatical about my skin for over twenty years, and this is the best product I&#x27;ve tried hands down.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s quick easy and refreshing</li>
<li> i have tattoos and it keeps the colors looking bright and new.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s just fine</li>
<li> , it goes on smoothly and is easy to blend in.  </li>
<li> Perhaps if is smelled nutty like sesame oil, it would be fine, but it has a perfume in it.  </li>
<li> If your skin is still quite damp it dries even more quickly.  </li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t like the scent of the other body oils I tried, but this is very pleasant.</li>
<li> This is lighter than coconut oil and is better absorbed more quickly.  </li>
<li> My favorite body oil in the whole world, it has a really great smell, it leaves your skin very soft and smooth&amp;#62; i have been using this product for years</li>
<li> Very light, soaks right in to your skin.</li>
<li> I am on day one of using and it&#x27;s made a huge difference already.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a huge Neutrogena fan and was perusing their products on Amazon when I stumbled across this.</li>
<li> Leaves my skin conditioned and smooth</li>
<li> When the product is fresh, it is outstanding.</li>
<li> I wish I had bought the fragrance free version of this product.  </li>

<li> It has a light orange blossom scent.</li>
<li> my body is smooth and comfortable..</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t notice this wasn&#x27;t fragrance free.</li>

<li> I have after the bath smooth touch in my skin.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s light yet moisturizing.</li>
<li> Ahh smooth and silky on my skin.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s light and not greasy at all.  </li>
<li> how light it feels on my skin.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m happy, too, that it comes in big bottles.</li>
<li> This stuff is fantastic.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t think I would like oil instead of lotion, but this is fantastic.</li>
<li> light scent that fades in no time at all and no one else can smell it.</li>
<li> I rarely use it and it isn&#x27;t cheap!</li>
<li> Lightly scented.</li>
<li> It goes on smoothly and doesnt take alot of it.</li>
<li> This product has a fantastic ability to wick through cotton, permanently bind to the fibers, and turn yellow-brown.</li>
<li> Wish the 40 ounce size was still available</li>
<li> Light smell.</li>
<li> It keeps my skin smooth and f</li>
<li> and it soaks in and leaves my skin feeling so smooth, but not greasy.</li>
<li> You smooth it on, towel if off, and follow up with a moisturizing cream.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m dropping a star from my review solely because I&#x27;d prefer an oil that wasn&#x27;t scented (the wife likes the Light Sesame smell..</li>
<li> Makes your skin feel fantastic.  </li>
<li> its fabulous.</li>
<li> No sticky but smooth</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t realize that this was not the fragrance free type.</li>
<li> It is so light that it&#x27;s almost non-existent.</li>
<li> This is my favorite - just the right amount of scent to it.</li>
<li> I love the smell, and you can put on clothes right away.</li>
<li> I recommend this product to anyone with dry skin problems or who justs want to maintain their healthy skin with a pleasantly scented body oil.</li>
<li> Love it, have loved it for a long time.  </li>
<li> Quick and easy to put on after I shower.</li>
<li> , I love the large bottle it comes in, it has a great flip top that makes it easy to use, without making a huge oily mess.  </li>
<li> Light scent and works great for dry skin.</li>
<li> It glides over the skin easily and is absorbed comfortable.</li>
<li> I use this right after I shower and love that it&#x27;s clear, light, and has a nice fragrance.  </li>
<li> As an added bonus, I noticed a surgery scar has faded and softened significantly since I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
<li> i was sooo excited..</li>
<li> and i rarely moisturize!....</li>
<li> I love to take a really hot bath</li>
<li> Great price for the big bottle here on Amazon, and it will last a once-a-day user  a good</li>
<li> This is a nice light oil, with a very subdued smell that is well absorbed.  </li>
<li> Worth every cent!</li>
<li> Then I rub the oil in small amounts and my skin is in perfect condition every day.  </li>
<li> This past winter though, I layered it under my thicker lotions and my skin felt wonderful.</li>
<li> The mild aroma is pleasant especially for those who have allergies to strong odors.  </li>
<li> This body oil is super greasy and not really easy to wash off which makes it perfect for extra-dry skin.</li>
<li> use it all the time great for dry skin.</li>
<li> A light mildly fragrant oil.</li>
<li> This is so soft and just soaks into your skin and smells nice and light.  </li>
<li> So if you have dry itchy skin than this is just the thing you need, it also works great for messages.  </li>
<li> Love the oil and isn&#x27;t too &#x27;perfumey&#x27;...it&#x27;s more of natural spice scent, not flowery and obnoxious...</li>
<li> Great for dry winter skin with out feeling greasy.</li>
<li> Love this body oil for when we do back rubs, have been using this kind for years, will keep buying</li>
<li> It absorbs quickly and my skin feels smooth and no dryness.  </li>
<li> very light non-gender type aroma with great moisturizing quality - natural and light enough to apply to hair without being greasy</li>
<li> I have very dry skin and tried this after all the great reviews.  </li>
<li> Makes my skin sooo smooth and moisturized (I have very dry skin) and it smells absolutely amazing!  </li>
<li> Hard to find in stores but moisturizers wonderfully.  </li>
<li> There is no real smell either, which is great.</li>
<li> Stops itchy skin and great for rough hands, elbows.  </li>
<li> Huge bottle lasts a long time and is a good value as a result.  </li>
<li> So much better than using baby oil, much lighter.</li>
<li> I like to use a cap full in a bath.</li>
<li> The light fragrance is fresh and clea.</li>
<li> it really works, and smells divine, but is not obnoxious, I dislike fragrance in lotions, but love this one .</li>
<li> Smells great and the price is far better than finding this product at a local retailer.</li>
<li> This oil not only feels good</li>
<li> Just feel nice and soft all day.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a tried and true.</li>
<li> this is a light oil that I like to apply while I&#x27;m still wet from my shower/bath - that&#x27;s all I need for the warm months and in the colder weather I used it as a top coat after I apply a thicker body butter.  </li>
<li> A nice soft scent too.  </li>
<li> My daughter called the next day to find out what I put on her because she loved the smell.</li>
<li> also do not like wearing perfume, so the light, shower fresh scent of this oil</li>
<li> The light sesame scent smells so fresh.  </li>
<li> Not bad,</li>
<li> Smells great, and it doesn&#x27;t leave your body feeling to oily like other products.  </li>
<li> The product arrived quickly and as described.  </li>
<li> Thank you for sending it so quickly and as described</li>
<li> The scent is mild</li>
<li> When I found out I was pregnant.</li>
<li> mild, sensual fragrance.</li>
<li> /&gt;It works wonderfully... for 10 minutes, but as soon as I stepped outside I could feel my skin drying and starting to peel..</li>
<li> She used it to help prevent stretch marks while she was pregnant.</li>
<li> I not only love the results, but I also love the feel of this body oil as well as the smell.</li>
<li> It is also not oily and dries quickly..</li>
<li> Super and well-priced</li>
<li> Absorbs quickly.</li>
<li> My skin absorbs this rather quickly so my legs begin to peel by the evening if I have shaven.</li>
<li> Light enough to even use in warm weather.</li>
<li> A lovely, after shower addition, which leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
<li> Luckily, the oil hadn&#x27;t leaked out and gotten all over, but it does make storage kind of obnoxious right now, so I&#x27;m going to have to steal a cap from an old shampoo bottle or something to replace this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It is great to put on right after a shower/bath, when you are still wet and don&#x27;t want to chaff or become ashy.</li>
<li> Has the original sesame smell (like the clear amber soap bars) that I love.</li>
<li> Nice neutral smell, barely noticeable.  </li>
<li> I have always loved this body/bath oil, it has been around forever, &amp; I will use it as long as I am around!</li>
<li> This is an easy &amp; fast fix</li>
<li> Really good for my dry skin.</li>
<li> It is easy to rub in and it does not stay oily when you rub it in really well.</li>
<li> This product is hands down, the most effective I have ever found at ruining sheets.</li>
<li> I would have given it 5 stars, but the bottle really needs a pump!!</li>
<li> I liked it better than putting petroleum based products on my skin and the previous version worked well.</li>
<li> which i am sure played a role..like many of you out there with dry skin</li>
<li> I am English and used to be able to buy it like this and in an atomiser for easy dispersing.</li>
<li> Wonderful product, just enough moisture to keep your skin from being dry.  </li>
<li> My skin is smooth, supple and has a type of glow to it in certain types of lights</li>
<li> Fast, soaks right into your skin, easy.  </li>
<li> I would whole heartedly suggest this product as a light oil body cover.</li>
<li> Has a great scent to it, nothing too strong just subtle.</li>
<li> The product is good, but be careful of the price.</li>
<li> This product lubricates and is absorbed by the skin, making it feel and look healthier.</li>
<li> Just a different kind of hassle than going to the store.</li>
<li> i wanted to start moisturizing since i rarely do.</li>
<li> love it keep myself soft</li>
<li> I love the soft smell of this fragrance..</li>
<li> but if you know what biosilk silk therapy smells like, this is that same kind of scent.</li>
<li> It is worth every penny.</li>
<li> I mix this with my regular lotion to make a nice silky feel</li>
<li> Soft and luminous skin effect, love this product</li>
<li> Same old great product I&#x27;ve used for decades.</li>
<li> I have had many compliments on the softness of my skin over the years, from people who seem simply amazed that my skin can be so smooth and soft!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> but it is well worth it.</li>
<li> Right after the shower, just rub some on your body and most of the day, you will be moisturized and soft.  </li>
<li> first learned of Neutrogena Light Sesame Body Oil from an article in a magazine about the personal favorite products of beauty profesionals.</li>
<li> The scent doesn&#x27;t move me one way or the other, but people tell me I smell good</li>
<li> Have used lots of other lotions etc., but find this extremely good.</li>
<li> Light, absorbs quickly, moisturizes, skin looks and smells great all day, and also blends with other fragrances easily if you are a perfume wearer (I&#x27;m not, but have friends who do layer this with other scents).  </li>
<li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newly devoted customer right here.  </li>
<li> I apply this immediately after drying off from the shower, and it soaks right in without feeling greasy.  </li>
<li> I rub it on my body right before I&#x27;m about to get out of the shower.</li>
<li> I put it on right out of the shower</li>
<li> Soaks right in and does not get on clothes.</li>
<li> and I put it on right after my shower .  </li>
<li> This oil leaves such a soft feeling and amazing smell!</li>
<li> The oil was mentioned several times as a tried and true after-bath or shower moisturizer for even the driest or most problematic skins.&lt;br</li>
<li> Love, love, love for my extra dry skin!</li>
<li> I read about 100 reviews on here and they were all super positive, so I went ahead</li>
<li> I have fragile , baby fine hair after having chemotherapy for breast cancer some years ago , and this seems like a good extra moisturizer to help protect my hair as I sleep.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
<li> Keeps skin perfectly hydrated and takes less time to apply than regular lotion.</li>
<li> Doesnt hydrate as much as I would expect oil to do so, but its gentle and glides on easily after a shower.</li>
<li> Just leaves a silky soft finish on your skin, not on your clothes, great for dry winter skin.</li>
<li> I liked the weight of the oil, it wasn&#x27;t too heavy, but the scent was way too strong for me.  </li>
<li> After sitting for a day the smell turned out to be musky , sweet and very sensual.  </li>
<li> It has a subtle sesame scent, I just loved it!</li>
<li> It is light and silky smooth not heavy and greasy where the first thing the person wants is to &amp;#34;get</li>
<li> The smell reminds of me of rich old ladies with lovely skin, which I&#x27;m completely here for.&lt;br</li>
<li> Use this as a &amp;#34;carrier oil&amp;#34; as it is so light and really penetrates the dermis very well.</li>
<li> Good quality but kind of expensive.</li>
<li> , they say I have a scent and a few people have gotten attached to it, so on some subconscious level, it must be nice to get a whiff of!  :)</li>
<li> I do also use this at times on my fully dry skin, and it&#x27;s still great, just a little more oily feeling at first.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
<li> It smells so very clean and is not heavy, absorbing without residue.</li>
<li> The oil itself is nice; I used it in combination with a body cream for these very dry winter months.</li>
<li> Lovely subtle scent; nice oil.</li>
<li> and there is just no other product that I love as much.</li>
<li> I highly recommend this to anyone who is wants to keep their skin looking fabulous.</li>
<li> When used together, my skin stays soft and smooth even during the coldest winters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> It makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.  </li>
<li> I am so glad I finally bought this.</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t American corporations just give us what is healthy and stop poisoning us?</li>
<li> have sensitive skin &amp;amp; therefore I&#x27;m really comfortable</li>
<li> my skin feels soft and smooth without feeling greasy (I can get dressed immediately).</li>
<li> i highly recommend this product for those suffering the itch!!</li>
<li> I have tried many different moisturizers/ oils</li>
<li> If you&#x27;ve ever used baby oil on you skin, then you already know exactly what this will be like.  </li>
<li> On first day I told my husband it  smelled like turpentine.  </li>
<li> Pretty much eliminates itching!</li>
<li> Just after a shower, rub in wet warm skin.</li>
<li> the price is divine also, and a lot more than I got from the local store.</li>
<li> I would highly recommend!!</li>
<li> dryness, soothes legs after shaving, makes my décolletage look younger , smooths over any stretch marks, makes skin feel sexy and well</li>
<li> Used in or out of the shower it leaves the skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
<li> Makes your skin so soft and smooth.</li>
<li> Before I get out of the shower, it turn the water on HOT..</li>
<li> I have been using this product for several years and love the product.  </li>
<li> no fake , over powering perfumey smell.</li>
<li> I saw this online and thought I would give it a try since the reviews seem to be pretty good.&lt;br</li>
<li> And she is more than picky about her products, especially for skin care.  </li>
<li> I will read more carefully next time.</li>
<li> I love this stuff, especially during winter weather.</li>
<li> I love this body oil and use it daily.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried lotions and creams, but nothing really seemed to do the job right. ..</li>
<li> A 32oz pump bottle of Neutrogena Light Sesame Body Oil sits on the ledge of my bath tub right next to my other very favorite bath/shower product.....</li>
<li> This is a tried and true product that works better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a very natural scent, which I have also gotten compliments on, as people simply think I smell good naturally, so</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried several methods from using it right in the shower to toweling off LIGHTLY and apply this afterward.</li>
<li> It is light, absorbs quickly, and leaves skin, well, luminous -- not exactly shiny, since it is absorbed well, but sort of shimmery (</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it immediately after the shower (without toweling off real quick) and I&#x27;ve used it after a quickly towel down (but still had some water on my skin).  </li>
<li> Works great on my dry skin in my dry climate.  </li>
<li> The scent is nice going on, then fades and is very subtle, although I do think when I renew, I&#x27;ll get the unscented just to be sure it&#x27;s not competing with my perfume.</li>
<li> Neutrogena Body Oil is an excellent, long lasting formula that both facilitates healing (of dry skin) and promotes skin enhancement (improvement in complexion).</li>
<li> I have noticed that this product makes my skin more dry then moisturizering it.</li>
<li> However, even when I tried it with the matching lotion on top, it still did not fully hydrate my dry skin.  </li>
<li> Leaves me feeling super soft.</li>
<li> I did notice at the bottom of the bottle there was a small dent that I was able to smooth  out  </li>
<li> and like many have mentioned i do use lotion afterwards, i prefer Olay body cream oil for dry skin for a body lotion..</li>
<li> Leaves me with super soft skin all day.</li>
<li> I used to have keratosis pilarsis on the backs of my arms - those dry bumps that form, most often on the arms.  </li>
<li> Ideally, you rub it on while you are still damp, but I refer to dry off a little bit.  </li>
<li> I used to purchase the large size of this from this store and when the stores no longer carried it, I found it on Amazon.</li>
<li> It certainly wouldn&#x27;t interrupt any perfume or cologne you would put on.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t know why people said it is not greasy, b/c it certainly is greasy.  </li>
<li> The price has certainly has gone up since I bought it years ago......</li>
<li> I was really hoping the scent would be similar to RAIN BATH, but it is not - bit strong for my taste.</li>
<li> My husband and I both use this body oil - love the scent, it really helps keep the flaky dry skin under control.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a classic for a reason!</li>
<li> It helps you to stay a little bit warm.  </li>
<li> Smells nice, keeps your skin moisturized and doesn&#x27;t require a lot as a small amount works very, very well.</li>
<li> This body oil works really well.</li>
<li> The price was reasonable.  </li>
<li> Also real bang for the buck.</li>
<li> I really didn&#x27;t want me or my boyfriend smelling like my grandma.  </li>
<li> really???</li>
<li> My whole family uses this body oil except for me</li>
<li> But will order fragrance free next time.</li>
<li> Thanks</li>
<li> but it was obviously fragrance free.</li>
<li> It really moisturizes and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
<li> Soaks in fairly fast, so you can get dressed soon after.  </li>
<li> I put it on just after a shower when I&#x27;m still wet, then put lotion on over the top of it to seal it in.  </li>
<li> Especially good for cold weather climates and after gym workout.  </li>
<li> I have used this for years, and now in my 50&#x27;s really need it  in the NW.  </li>
<li> Your lips will feel extra sensitive and a combination of incense from the sesame oil and your partner&#x27;s own natural smell will combine into an intense desireable fragrance.</li>
<li> I sometimes mix this together with my regular body lotion that is in a pump dispenser for that satin smooth feel.</li>
<li> I actually smooth what is left on my hands into my hair after a nightly shower, to retain moisture and make hair feel silkier.  </li>
<li> My go to moisturizer straight after a shower.  </li>
<li> I have used this for years and really appreciate it after shaving.  </li>
<li> I highly recommend this to my fellow ladies!</li>
<li> Too much bother to return</li>
<li> I have really always had it -</li>
<li> Next time I&#x27;ll try the fragrance-free one if it&#x27;s available.</li>
<li> Skin is very moisturized.  </li>
<li> This body oil really helped overcome a lot of that.  </li>
<li> The smell is OK just not what I expected.  </li>
<li> This bottle lasts much longer than one thinks as one</li>
<li> I use this after I shower and it moisturizers really well</li>
<li> I need to use it more often, but with this big old bottle now I can.</li>
<li> That being said, I do use more than \\&quot;a few drops\\&quot; when I apply, but still, it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
<li> that lingers pleasantly but subtly.   </li>
<li> I keep the oil right by the shower, and it keeps my skin soft.</li>
<li> Love the mild scent + the oil absorbs relatively quickly and does not leave behind a residue.  </li>
<li> I used it for the first time yesterday, and I have to say that it did leave my skin feeling very soft and well-moisturized.</li>
<li> It also has a slight aroma to it, just enough to be pleasant.</li>
<li> Tried many other types.  </li>
<li> Its great because a little bit goes a long way and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  </li>
<li> /&gt;- Smells great when applying and stays consistent throughout the day (just a little less intense as the day goes on of course)</li>
<li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who might enjoy a new scent with their moisturizer.</li>
<li> If I was asked to pick my favorite beauty product, Neutrogena body oil would be the hands down winner.  </li>
<li> Great for my skin too, especially during long dry winters.</li>
<li> I live in the southwest and my skin really dries out in the winter.</li>
<li> Once dry, your skin is silky smooth but not oily.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s soft and smooth, I don&#x27;t itch from the dryness, and my legs are no longer white with flaking skin!  </li>
<li> I get more compliments on this product than I do many of my expensive perfumes.</li>
<li> and it definitely moisturizes the skin adequately.</li>
<li> I purchased this at Amazon for my wife after our local drug store quick carrying it.  </li>
<li> Highly recommend.  </li>
<li> Highly recommend.</li>
<li> Highly recommend.</li>
<li> I highly recommed this product..</li>
<li> Highly recommended.</li>
<li> Would highly recommend this body oil.  </li>
<li> Leaves me skin so soft !!</li>
<li> It is VERY floral, reminding me of old ladies perfumes from the 1960&#x27;s.</li>
<li> Keeps my skin soft for the whole day.  </li>
<li> It does work very well, but it gives me and anyone standing near me a headache from the smell.  </li>
<li> I want to start by explaining that I really don&#x27;t wear perfume or body spray because I&#x27;m so sensitive to the chemical</li>
<li> On it&#x27;s own, it is not effective.  </li>
<li> and it instantly get absorbed into my skin and</li>
<li> I do my normal shower routine and</li>
<li> This is one of the few scented products I have been able to use.  </li>
<li> Much better than baby oil if you put it on Freshly dried off skin.  </li>
<li> That was several years and many bottles ago, and I haven&#x27;t had a dry skin problem since.  </li>
<li> So, that&#x27;s why I will quickly towel down first, then apply.  </li>
<li> I have very dry skin and tried many different creams and lotions, which wasn&#x27;t doing it for me any longer.  </li>
<li> It has a light fragrance that doesn&#x27;t interfere with other perfumes I may wear.</li>
<li> I couldn&#x27;t live without this oil.  </li>
<li> Probably going to buy a new bottle to put it in.</li>
<li> I live on this stuff all through the winter.</li>
<li> I live in Australia and this product is not availble at all.</li>
<li> Rather than using preservatives in the oil, would rather risk it going rancid at which time I would just toss it away and buy new.</li>
<li> My new sheets were hideously stained after one use.</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t live without this stuff, use it every time I shower or bathe.  </li>
<li> and it made my skin super dry.</li>
<li> My legs get so dry in the winter and this helps tremendously.  </li>
<li> a little oil after your shower can make you more comfortable, and may draw your wife in a little closer..</li>
<li> It makes my skin very soft.</li>
<li> Leaves skin very soft.</li>
<li> Totally keeps skin soft - use it right out of the shower.</li>
<li> I use after shower before drying off, then my regular body lotion, makes my skin super soft and leaves a nice scent behind (if you like the smell that is, also comes unscented).</li>
<li> Makes my skin so soft!</li>
<li> Beware if you are sensitive to odors!</li>
<li> nearly 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ha!</li>
<li> I added a pump to my bottle and it is more efficient and no more drips.</li>
<li> and I get compliments on how soft my skin is all the time!  </li>
<li> right before I turn off the water, I smooth a little of this on my back, arms, legs, etc.....</li>
<li> If I dry myself off too much and wait too long to apply the oil, I just lightly dampen my skin and then apply the oil.</li>
<li> sesame oils available at Whole Foods and other places locally.  </li>
<li> Also, the bottle is huge, so I anticipate it lasting quite a long while.</li>
<li> Light, absorbs quickly, no stickiness, and smells move too,  I have used it for years.  </li>
<li> slippery.&lt;br /&gt;Can be applied over wet, damp, or dry skin with outstanding results.&lt;br /&gt;Combats</li>
<li> Right after a shower before I dry off, I apply oil and then towel off</li>
<li> It&#x27;s just as good if not better than the other name brand oils on the market today.</li>
<li> I enjoy the smell and sometimes add a little to my hair.</li>
<li> The price is decent and it lasts a long time as you don&#x27;t need to use too much each day.</li>
<li> Love this oil hard to find in stores.</li>
<li> Be careful on ordering, I noticed that on one offer page switching from 8.5 ounces fragrance free to 16 ounces suddenly changes to this unbearable fully fragrant variety.</li>
<li> It isn&#x27;t greasy and absorbs into my skin, keeping it soft.</li>
<li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt that when I used it immediately after showering it didn&#x27;t absorb completely.  </li>
<li> I put it on after a shower and my skin still feels soft in the evening.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t mind the natural smell of sesame oil.  </li>
<li> but I have an old one I keep refilling.</li>
<li> Now everyone in my family is soft to the touch...</li>
<li> Smells like old ladies.</li>
<li> Immediately makes you skin soft and absorbs into it.</li>
<li> I still my old bottle of Neutrogena body oil</li>
<li> but I tend to become sensitive to fragrances.</li>
<li> I used it one time after a shower and went straight back to my Curel moisturizer.  </li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t tried it but what I read so far doesn&#x27;t make me want to buy it.</li>
<li> It leaves my skin as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  </li>
<li> Keeps my skin soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
<li> I would see this at my local drug stores all the time, but I felt it cost to much.  </li>
<li> I even i apply to my 2 year old daughter after the shower..</li>
<li> I use this after each shower and it makes my skin feel particularly soft - even in winter months.  </li>
<li> THE SMELL IS SO &#x27;SOFT&#x27;</li>
<li> I have to mention that i have sensitive skin</li>
<li> so if you have sensitive skin don&#x27;t buy it ..</li>
<li> it leaves .my skin feeling soft with no oily feeling.</li>
<li> I have tried cheaper brands, and they work well, but Neutrogena by far is my favourite.  </li>
<li> Cortizone cream helped, but then I started getting very itchy spots on my legs, back, etc.  </li>
<li> Makes my skin feel soft w/o being oily.</li>
<li> Nothing more to say really, except that you should consider transferring it to a clean pump bottle to control how much you use at a time; the bottle it comes in is a little difficult to use.</li>
<li> A little bit goes a long way and this large bottle will keep you silky smooth for months.  </li>
<li> I use it on my wet skin right after a shower or bath.....</li>
<li> I have pretty sever dry skin &amp; eczema in winter...</li>
<li> Living in AZ is pretty dry and lotions don&#x27;t rehydrate my skin after showering like this</li>
<li> As usual, Neutrogena knows their stuff and this product comes easily recommended.</li>
<li> [[ASIN:B000BRXWKM Vitabath Moisturizing Bath &amp; Shower Gelee, Original Spring Green]].</li>
<li> We use to buy this at the local store but found they don&#x27;t carry it in the 16oz size anymore which is the better buy and half the time you can only find &amp;#34;scent free&amp;#34;,  my husband loves the scent as he puts it &amp;</li>
<li> I started using this last winter when my skin was so dry from the cold weather - and it works beautifully!  </li>
<li> I much prefer toweling off a bit first, then putting it on, then I let it dry for a moment while I dry my hair and wrap it up.  </li>
<li> I step out of the shower and immediately put a light coating all over while I&#x27;m still wet before toweling dry.  </li>
<li> The oil is quickly absorbed into the skin, almost nothing is left on the towel used to dry yourself.</li>
<li> Usually I use this in the summer because it&#x27;s so light, but covers well.  </li>
<li> We also use the Neutrogena Moisture Rich Body Wash (the dark blue color).  </li>
<li> The pop up top lends to the oil running down the side of the bottle and on to the vanity or other surface, and from your hands to the bottle again.&lt;br</li>
<li> (I put some in a spritz bottle for those harder to reach places on my back) and is quickly absorbed.</li>
<li> The product is good but it came with the lid broken, so I have to be careful with it or it will leak everywhere.</li>
<li> The combination of this oil and lotion keeps my body very soft; especially in winter months.</li>
<li> my hands, feet, elbows and any other area that I think could use a little more softening and smoothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Purchased by word of mouth and no regrets!</li>
<li> This stuff is so amazing that even if it was the worse smelling product in the world I would still use it!</li>
<li> It really keeps my skin from getting real dry during the winter.  </li>
<li> The smell takes me back to my young days on the beach.</li>
<li> boyfriend constantly raving about my soft skin.</li>
<li> also just for a complete understanding of my skin regimen, i exfoliated with burts bess sugar scrub prior to shower and then applied the body oil;</li>
<li> It has kept my skin baby soft and looking years younger than my age.  </li>
<li> Because if it can do that to my sheets, it can do that to your shirts, your pants, and your bed-linen if you oil yourself up and go to bed without putting a rubber mat down first.</li>
<li> But my parents use it everyday and we even order in bulk when we go on vacation because we give them out to our extended family since they can&#x27;t really get this product where they live.</li>
<li> Then they crack open and the new tissue under them tears open.  </li>
<li> The fall/winter weather has me in aisles buying every lotion available to quench my ultra dry skin, nothing is working that doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy grease after feel.&lt;br</li>
<li> Very subtle, not greasy at all, very light.</li>
<li> I was not able to purchase it in the retail stores, but was lucky to find it in Amazon.  </li>
<li> I thought an oil would be extremely moisturizing, but my skin didn&#x27;t feel or look very hydrated at all.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s too bad, since it is actually very moisturizing and gave my skin a nice sheen.</li>
<li> The fragrance is delicate and clean and not cloying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Keeps your skin nice and soft during all of these cold winter days and nights.</li>
<li> (I have very sensitive dry</li>
<li> It can be messy pouring it right out of the 16-ounce bottle, so I pour some into a smaller container that I refill after it&#x27;s used up.</li>
<li> But, I do have very severe psoriasis (the clinical diagnosis is &#x27;extreme psoriasis&#x27; actually).  </li>
<li> It makes a difference as you age and skin begins to be less elastic and does not produce as much oil.  </li>
<li> It goes on and absorbs quickly leaving behind soft glowing skin and a subtle light fragrance that reminds me of the beach (suntan lotion and jasmine mixed with sand).</li>
<li> but they are so thick that I go through them quickly.</li>
<li> not dreading the old inevitable itch that is associated with extremely dry skin..</li>
<li> After applying, let dry for a few minutes and to be absorbed.  </li>
<li> Well, after several more trips back to the islands and with very few bites, I continue to use this product year round.  </li>
<li> Will leave your skin silky smooth after a shower, with a very delicate scent.  </li>
<li> Put it in the shower or near the bathtub and remember to use it while your skin is still wet!</li>
<li> I have especially dry and sensitive skin, so this works well to keep my hydrated, even if I forget to put lotion on afterward.  </li>
<li> As an adult, I no longer struggle with eczema but have found as I have aged, my skin is dry.  </li>
<li> This is the only thing that helps my constant dry skin.</li>
<li> True, it does absorb quickly but the smell is unpleasant and a lot stronger than some other reviews indicated.  </li>
<li> do enjoy the smell, and it just leaves a faint lasting scent, but nothing that I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily notice unless I smelled my arm or something.  </li>
<li> This bottle will last a long time.</li>
<li> Extra Dry Skin - 20.2</li>
<li> (only takes a moment) or just pat dry with a towel.  </li>
<li> I was about to run out of lotion and needed something that could handle how dry and flaky my shins and elbows tend to get - especially now when I&#x27;m flying a lot for work.&lt;br</li>
<li> , you know no amount of moisturizer will work on dry flaky skin unless exfoliated properly.</li>
<li> It makes a big difference with my dry skin.</li>
<li> And unfortunately, the smell is strong and lasts all day too.</li>
<li> It also has a very gentle and subtle scent that lasts throughout the day.</li>
<li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it will help with winter dry skin though.</li>
<li> I was never a body oil fan due to one very greasy and messy experience that ruined a pair of pants.</li>
<li> It has helped me get rid of a patch of very dry skin I had on the back of my neck.  </li>
<li> Just a little bit of Neutrogena Body Oil in the shower helps keep my skin soft without feeling oily.</li>
<li> Living in cold weather most of the year (it seems anyway)</li>
<li> It&#x27;s light and silky with just a faint fragrance.  </li>
<li> so I was careful to pour just enough at a time in my palm.</li>
<li> A long term favourite.</li>
<li> The problem is that it has a strange \\&quot;nutty/chemically\\&quot; smell.</li>
<li> So you are not oily for long.</li>
<li> long while - mine lasts about 3 months.</li>
<li> I would recommend this to anyone, as long as you are not allergic to sesame.</li>
<li> I like the smell, but does not leave my skin hydrated all day long.</li>
<li> so I would suggest getting a spray bottle (I use a Skin So Soft spray bottle) to prevent waste.</li>
<li> Keeps your body shinning &amp; oily all day long.</li>
<li> The small flip top was broken when it arrived.  </li>
<li> I dealt with very dry, itchy and cracking skin on my arms and legs for several years and multiple visits to my doctor and recommended dermatologists did little to relieve the problem with diagnoses ranging from a possible mite infestation to psoriasis or eczema.  </li>
<li> I have really dry skin and use it daily after shower while I&#x27;m still wet.</li>
<li> Well, it&#x27;s been a long, dry winter in the Northeast</li>
<li> something good especially through this exceptionally brutal winter.</li>
<li> I just don&#x27;t know how it took me so long to realize this exists!</li>
<li> At first, I was a little disappointed but realized it doesn&#x27;t leave a strong smell.</li>
<li> /&gt;The oil is meant to be applied to the body immediately after bathing or showering but before toweling dry.</li>
<li> I have used this for 30 years and depend on it to prevent dry skin.</li>
<li> I have dry skin and started using baby oil after a shower for some time now.</li>
<li> In fact, it felt equally as dry (as if I had applied a dry oil) with a bit of a sheen.  </li>
<li> I just need something for my dry skin during the fall and winter.  </li>
<li> Scub well in the shower, pat dry</li>
<li> I love using it in this  bitter cold north&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> My doctor recommended this body oil for my dry and aging skin.  </li>
<li> The doctor told me to take either a shower or bath and without drying off, rub the oil all over my body and either let it self dry</li>
<li> Instead of rigorously toweling myself dry after my shower, I do a cursory drying, leaving my skin quite damp and then immediately use the oil.</li>
<li> I have dry extremities, from years being out in the sun.</li>
<li> i battle from really dry itchy skin with areas of eczema, and after getting into the shower and lathering this on in nyc winter weather..</li>
<li> I do not have dry skin.  </li>
<li> If you have dry skin, this will help.  </li>
<li> I use it on my tattoo, when my skin is dry in winter.  </li>
<li> Kinda seals my skin for protection from the dry Alaskan winter.</li>
<li> I have tried all kinds of oils over the years to combat dry skin.  </li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;to dry skin.</li>
<li> use it every time after I shower and before I dry myself.</li>
<li> Use to moisturize winter (dry) skin at end of shower before drying off.</li>
<li> This oil did nothing for my dry skin.</li>
<li> This cured my winter dry skin.  </li>
<li> My skin was still rather  dry after applying</li>
<li> Then blot dry.</li>
<li> I use alot of product for extremely dry skin and this works rather well.</li>
<li> One dermatologist did say it was just dry skin and to stop taking a shower each day.  </li>
<li> Helps dry skin</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a man, but I still suffer from dry skin in winter.  </li>
<li> , you don&#x27;t need to suffer the scratchy elbows or the dry eczema patches..</li>
<li> In the winter my skin gets extremely dry.  </li>
<li> the dry weather.  </li>
<li> After three  or four times trying to get past the smell I poured the whole 15.5 ounces down the drain.</li>
<li> I use this every single day in the shower, before toweling off.  </li>
<li> I have used this product in the past for an extended period (6 months) and noticed considerable results on the long-term smoothness/softness of my skin.</li>
<li> Not bad to use for massage, but kinda expensive for that purpose.</li>
<li> After my bath or shower, I simply use my wrung out wash cloth to dry myself, leaving my skin slightly damp.  </li>
<li> Before I started using this product, my skin was dry and rough.  </li>
<li> I am curious to see how hydrating it is in the winter when dry skin is at</li>
<li> The only issue I have with the product is that it smells slightly &amp;#34;old-ladyish&amp;#34;.</li>
<li> After I showered I would spray some on my wet body and then air dry.</li>
<li> One of the less desirable effects is that thick plaques form over large areas of my skin.  </li>
<li> Even after using it in shower and then re applying it my skin is very dry.</li>
<li> They become very dry.  </li>
<li> I have very dry skin.  </li>
<li> I tend to have very dry skin.  </li>
<li> i live where the winter is heavy and harsh on your skin</li>
<li> I highly recommend it for those of you who live in cold weather climates, as it heals dry skin, and relieves itchiness.</li>
<li> My dry skin is a memory not a reality, no longer have to buy other lotions .</li>
<li> It lasts longer due to needing to use less for same results that I get from thicker oils.</li>
<li> but next time I will get straight up jojoba oil to avoid creepy preservatives.</li>
<li> However, for me, it doesn&#x27;t work as well in the shower as I expected it to.  </li>
<li> So I have to be careful.</li>
<li> I put this on after i wash and am still wet</li>
<li> My co-worker (male) came in smelling like this stuff a few days ago.&lt;br</li>
<li> I would have spent almost $20 for this size.</li>
<li> I use it when I&#x27;m in the shower and put it on still wet skin.  </li>
<li> so I just use empty bottle spray and refill it with this and problem solved.</li>
<li> Use all over body after shower or bath when your body is slightly wet.  </li>
<li> A little goes a long way</li>
<li> Compared to other stretch mark oils and the prices.</li>
<li> It was packed with other items that weren&#x27;t harmed.</li>
<li> Not pretty.</li>
<li> There are other oils that I like</li>
<li> and it don&#x27;t leave your skin feeling oily like other products.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t even use any other lotion or oils  anymore</li>
<li> I purchased this product due to a recommendation of a friend.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s odorless and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy like some other brands I tried.</li>
<li> My arms and lega which i applied the oil on are covered with small red pimples!!</li>
<li> Other notes :  </li>
<li> No discernible odor so doesn&#x27;t get in the way of other scents you might wear; non greasy</li>
<li> use it either after a shower (let it soak in for a few seconds then towel dry) or pour some in a bath....</li>
<li> I get all the benefits from oiling my dry skin, but without the heavy feel, and it is easier to apply than creams.  </li>
<li> I do not have very dry skin, but it does need a little &amp;#34;lubrication&amp;#34; after a shower.  </li>
<li> The hole in the spout could be a little smaller because at the size that it is now, it could  (and does in my case) lead to a lot of waste, which is my only complaint.</li>
<li> The only negative comment I can state is that it has to be applied to your skin while  your skin is moist.  </li>
<li> This is not your average review.  </li>
<li> Added fragrance is potentially irritating to sensitive skin, and I don&#x27;t like the way the perfume in this product smells.  </li>
<li> Do not use when you are using fake tanning products as it will remove the color and make it harder for new product to adhere to your skin.  </li>
<li> I use my wash cloth after my bath and pour the Sesame oil onto the cloth and rub my body down with it.  </li>
<li> Tried other body oils but none compare!</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t purchased or used lotion or any other moisturizing product since!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s  have saved my skin this winter; none of the usual itchy dry skin.</li>
<li> I can then dry off as usual and go about my day with hydrated skin.  </li>
<li> UPDATE ON PREVIOUS REVIEW</li>
<li> I could care less about the smell and stuff</li>
<li> no more scaly, dry, winter-ravaged arms and legs!</li>
<li> and so when standing up in what feels like a cold room, still dripping wet, I feel really chilled until dressing.  </li>
<li> I used a previous version of this</li>
<li> Use it in combination with 99 cent lotion from the 99 cent store, reason makes it less grease</li>
<li> I will say that I don&#x27;t have especially dry skin, but I drink lots of water, and I care in this way for my skin every day with few exceptions - maybe 10 days out of a year, and I have done this for over two decades.  </li>
<li> This has an odd aroma.</li>
<li> I had used Sesame oil previously but it was bought for me as a gift, so I could never find it.</li>
<li> only needs to use a small squirt of this for application to a small to medium region.</li>
<li> I use it for massage oil, too, because it doesn&#x27;t make an oily mess all over.</li>
<li> This is lightly-scented and it is not as heavy as your typical baby oil.</li>
<li> I usually buy extra thick lotion to compensate&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
<li> i thought ordering online would make my life a little easier.</li>
<li> I got a little carried away and bought 5 bottles of the body oil.  </li>
<li> I may have to get something a little stronger for the shower but for my baths...</li>
<li> But that is little to contend with because the end result is that my skin stops itching</li>
<li> After a shower, I dab my skin with a towel (so its still a little damp/wet).</li>
<li> I bought it on Amazon because it tends to be a little cheaper then the stores.</li>
<li> I want a LITTLE of oil&#x27;s properties.</li>
<li> I get dry skin during the cold season and after a shower I go out of my mind with an itchy back or other itchy</li>
<li> I just started using this oil a few months ago.</li>
<li> I had to wear a lot of heavy, greasy creams to ease the chronic dryness and itching.  </li>
<li> It made for a messy package covered in oil.</li>
<li> I would definitely not use this in the shower or a tub as it leaves a thin film of oil everywhere</li>
<li> It isn&#x27;t a heavy oil.  </li>
<li> Nothing heavy like baby oil.  </li>
<li> And, not just &#x27;one time&#x27;, but for a few days.  </li>
<li> I have been using this every day for a few years.  </li>
<li> You can use it all year round.</li>
<li> It not too heavy or greasy.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t believe the difference in my skin in less than one week!  </li>
<li> Too bad, I had high hopes from all the other reviews.</li>
<li> Creams and lotions simply dont work for me in the dry, cold weather.</li>
<li> When I finish my shower I rub a few small teaspoons into my still damp self.. then let it soak in as I squeegee the walls of the shower.  </li>
<li> : I have found that using it in the shower helps it absorb into the skin without leaving a dry oil residue behind.  </li>
<li> my skin is always dry and got tired of applying lotion all over my body.</li>
<li> I have to use all natural products including essential oils and that gets very expensive!  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m super lazy and hate taking the time putting lotion on after I get out of the shower.</li>
<li> One negative is that the oil does take a little bit of time to absorb into your skin.</li>
<li> i keep it in the shower and use it everyday!</li>
<li> Its not magic just body oil so be patient and stick with it.</li>
<li> Why?&lt;br /&gt;Me: Because I&#x27;ve been smelling this for the past year or so, it almost makes me puke to smell it and Is usually around elderly ladies when I smell it.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s one of the most awful smells....ever.</li>
<li> It can make your shower slick if you spill it</li>
<li> Not sure if it work because I can&#x27;t get passed the smell.</li>
<li> I just could not get past the headache-inducing smell</li>
<li> This leaves you with slick hands and the treated area.</li>
<li> to the point where I have raw bloody patches of skin from scratching so much and loss sleep over waking up every few hours with an itch attack on my body.</li>
<li> The black cap was broken and the safety seal was ripped.  </li>
<li> and sometimes it is hard to find.</li>
<li> USED it for years and now that they seemed to have stopped making them in 32 ounce bottle, this is my least inexpensive option.</li>
<li> This oil smells awful - smells like old lady perfume mixed commercial-grade air freshener.  </li>
<li> well, as the breast and chest area, to relieve tightness after having had breast reconstruction, and help skin stay supple in that delicate area.</li>
<li> I use body lotion at least once a day.  </li>
<li> Oil is not too thick.  </li>
<li> I mean, at almost $13 a bottle, seems pricy for some body oil.  </li>
<li> No more itching!</li>
<li> It will make your bathtub just disgusting though, you will have to clean it after.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
<li> It is a little uncomfortable to get out of towels (also leave scent behind on them) but soaking in detergent for a few hours does the trick.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t put it into my bath water because I&#x27;m afraid of slipping and falling.</li>
<li> and I got painful itching and hives on back and shoulders.  </li>
<li> I picked this up the other day because my skin has been itching like crazy this winter.</li>
<li> However, the smell is truly awful and it consistently gave me headaches.</li>
<li> and it has a very delicate perfume.</li>
<li> that&#x27;s the secret</li>
<li> Body Oil delivered on time but the cap was broken.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s worse.</li>
<li> I got this bottle with the cap broken off.</li>
<li> and I do not see the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; (broken off) piece of the cap in the box with it.</li>
<li> I have bumpy skin in my legs and this oil made the bumps worse.</li>
<li> But after three days, I broke out in the worse rash</li>
<li> A few years ago I started getting itchy rashes on my arms that drove me crazy.  </li>
<li> Seriously?!</li>
<li> This product does have a slight odor that is neither bad nor overpowering.</li>
<li> bottle arrived with the cap broken at the hinge unfortunately.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m so sick of the heavy after feel of the &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34;</li>
<li> Was a little disappointed to see that Propylparaben and BHT were listed in the ingredients.  </li>
<li> I am sad to report that this is not as emollient or humectant as my skin needs to find comfort.  </li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
<li> I am just disappointed when I received it that the cap is broken.</li>
<li> The itching drove me crazy &amp; this lasted a week.  </li>
<li> you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the smell is... inexplicable.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t believe the hype, as I&#x27;m skeptical by nature, but this stuff is liquid gold!  </li>
<li> Wrong!</li>
<li> Very faint smell...clean.</li>
<li> I have had an aversion to body lotions since I was a child with bad eczema.  </li>
<li> Smells bad.</li>
<li> it has a bad smell</li>
<li> I am disappointed in neutrogena.</li>
<li> so I was disappointed to see that..</li>
<li> Yes, it is just as miserable and painful as the description sounds.  </li>
<li> , you spend a lot of you waking hours just being wretchedly miserable.  </li>
<li> I felt relief almost immediately after this stuff touched my skin, even on my worst patch.</li>
<li> But the smell is just horrible.</li>
<li> One of the WORST!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the smell and it softens your skin.</li>
    <li> The product is good, but be careful of the price. This listing says it is $0.35/oz, but it&#x27;s actually $0.81/oz.</li>
    <li> Good quality but kind of expensive.</li>
    <li> Used this for years.  Don&#x27;t know why I stopped.  Tried many other types.  Love returning to this product and the scent.</li>
    <li> use it all the time great for dry skin.</li>
    <li> This body oil works really well. No too oily. It also has a slight aroma to it, just enough to be pleasant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years! I used to purchase the large size of this from this store and when the stores no longer carried it, I found it on Amazon. I am on auto-delivery for this and I&#x27;ve even gotten an ex boyfriend of mine hooked on it. This is lightly-scented and it is not as heavy as your typical baby oil. The hole in the spout could be a little smaller because at the size that it is now, it could  (and does in my case) lead to a lot of waste, which is my only complaint.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and sometimes it is hard to find. I have it on subscription at Amazon and they are so good about having it to me every 2 months. I love the feel and silkiness this gives my skin and cannot imagine anything else working as good.</li>
    <li> UPDATE 8/20/15:&lt;br /&gt;My opinion as expressed in my 2009 review has not changed one bit. This is a tried and true product that works better than any other I&#x27;ve tried. I use it every time I shower or bathe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL 2009 REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;I am totally devoted to this product! A 32oz pump bottle of Neutrogena Light Sesame Body Oil sits on the ledge of my bath tub right next to my other very favorite bath/shower product.....[[ASIN:B000BRXWKM Vitabath Moisturizing Bath &amp; Shower Gelee, Original Spring Green]]. When used together, my skin stays soft and smooth even during the coldest winters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first learned of Neutrogena Light Sesame Body Oil from an article in a magazine about the personal favorite products of beauty profesionals. The oil was mentioned several times as a tried and true after-bath or shower moisturizer for even the driest or most problematic skins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is meant to be applied to the body immediately after bathing or showering but before toweling dry. The oil is quickly absorbed into the skin, almost nothing is left on the towel used to dry yourself. Once dry, your skin is silky smooth but not oily. The fragrance is delicate and clean and not cloying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then apply a good moisturizer like([[ASIN:B000NRSZYI Olay Quench Body Lotion Extra Dry Skin - 20.2 Oz]])to my hands, feet, elbows and any other area that I think could use a little more softening and smoothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil and the moisturizer combine to form a moisture barrier on the skin that lasts and lasts. It&#x27;s surprising to see how quickly the oil works! And how much more effective it is to use the after-bath oil than just an moisturizer by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a good investment in your skin&#x27;s health and appearance!</li>
    <li> I buy this oil over and over again and I LOVE it. Here are all my &amp;#34;pros&amp;#34;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Smells really nice&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves my skin conditioned and smooth (I have very sensitive dry skin)&lt;br /&gt;- It is also great for shaving (legs)&lt;br /&gt;- Relieves itchiness&lt;br /&gt;- No sticky feeling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it either after a shower (let it soak in for a few seconds then towel dry) or pour some in a bath.... also put in my hair once in while.</li>
    <li> When the product is fresh, it is outstanding. A light mildly fragrant oil. keeps senior skin from getting too crackly!</li>
    <li> This is the best body oil on the market. It isn&#x27;t greasy and absorbs into my skin, keeping it soft. The price is great too.</li>
    <li> Smells so good! Could be more moisturizing but supplementing with a heavier lotion on elbows and knees. So far so good this winter!</li>
    <li> Smells great but stains clothes. I went back to using lotion.</li>
    <li> good moisturizer in winter for after-shower use.  not bad scent.  better than mineral oil based bath oils</li>
    <li> I have used this for 30 years and depend on it to prevent dry skin.</li>
    <li> Daaanng!! I didn&#x27;t believe the hype, as I&#x27;m skeptical by nature, but this stuff is liquid gold!  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of days and its made such an impact, I can never be without it!  The fall/winter weather has me in aisles buying every lotion available to quench my ultra dry skin, nothing is working that doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy grease after feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this at Target and thought, hmm, I&#x27;ll read the amazon reviews before I actually commit to purchase.  I mean, at almost $13 a bottle, seems pricy for some body oil.  I&#x27;m kind of a cheapo with things.  After reading rave reviews, I figured I&#x27;d commit to it, and picked it up next time I was at the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it immediately after the shower (without toweling off real quick) and I&#x27;ve used it after a quickly towel down (but still had some water on my skin).  I much prefer toweling off a bit first, then putting it on, then I let it dry for a moment while I dry my hair and wrap it up.  After that, I will wrap my body towel around me and go about my routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt that when I used it immediately after showering it didn&#x27;t absorb completely.  It got wiped off when I toweled off.  So, that&#x27;s why I will quickly towel down first, then apply.  I love that this product doesn&#x27;t leave any residual oil or greasiness.  I&#x27;m so sick of the heavy after feel of the &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; winter lotions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do enjoy the smell, and it just leaves a faint lasting scent, but nothing that I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily notice unless I smelled my arm or something.  It certainly wouldn&#x27;t interrupt any perfume or cologne you would put on.  The smell reminds of me of rich old ladies with lovely skin, which I&#x27;m completely here for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newly devoted customer right here.  Will be stocking up on Amazon, probably be purchasing some as stocking stuffers for my family members.</li>
    <li> This product is my daily routine for NY winters... I cant seem to find it in regular pharmacy stores so I ordered it on amazon.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so amazing that even if it was the worse smelling product in the world I would still use it! I have pretty sever dry skin &amp; eczema in winter...to the point where I have raw bloody patches of skin from scratching so much and loss sleep over waking up every few hours with an itch attack on my body. I am on day one of using and it&#x27;s made a huge difference already. Itch free, soft skin, happy lady.</li>
    <li> Love it. Forgot how good is this oil.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin so soft!</li>
    <li> Love this oil after my shower.  Makes my skin feel like silk.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It is an excellent moisturizer if used immediately after showering.  It soaks in to skin almost immediately and holds moisture in the skin.  The product arrived quickly and as described.  The price was reasonable.  I ordered 3 bottles.  I used to be able to buy this at the store, now, I have to purchase it online.  Thank you for sending it so quickly and as described</li>
    <li> Good stuff and timely service.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful!  Right after the shower, just rub some on your body and most of the day, you will be moisturized and soft.  A little bit goes a long way and this large bottle will keep you silky smooth for months.  After applying, let dry for a few minutes and to be absorbed.  Enjoy your youthful skin!  Before I started using this product, my skin was dry and rough.  I don&#x27;t ever want to go without this oil on my skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a repeat customer!</li>
    <li> Did not like it. Been using it for 2 weeks and it made my skin super dry. Even after using it in shower and then re applying it my skin is very dry. I am a lover of creams and moisturizers and have a ton at home. I have noticed that this product makes my skin more dry then moisturizering it. I am disappointed in neutrogena.</li>
    <li> I was hoping that it wasn&#x27;t scented,  but it is..and I didn&#x27;t like the scent.  Also it doesn&#x27;t seem to blend well with the vanilla scent I got.  It just settles at the bottom</li>
    <li> Great on your body after you shower!</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and started using baby oil after a shower for some time now. I switched to body oil for the scent and feel. I love this product. Right after a shower before I dry off, I apply oil and then towel off and my skin smells great and is very soft. It works well on those dryer ares too such as heels and elbows.</li>
    <li> Love this body oil.  It smells so good and feels good on my body.  The scent is mild so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with perfume; I but. It is a great scent to use on it&#x27;s own.  It makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.  I put it on after a shower and my skin still feels soft in the evening.</li>
    <li> I used it for the first time yesterday, and I have to say that it did leave my skin feeling very soft and well-moisturized. It is an extremely light, thin liquid so I was careful to pour just enough at a time in my palm. The scent is not over-powering, which is nice. Also, the bottle is huge, so I anticipate it lasting quite a long while.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and tried this after all the great reviews.  I am sad to report that this is not as emollient or humectant as my skin needs to find comfort.  The oil feels nice and it spreads well.  It takes a while for it to absorb even though it is lightweight, but that didn&#x27;t bother me.  I thought an oil would be extremely moisturizing, but my skin didn&#x27;t feel or look very hydrated at all.  In fact, it felt equally as dry (as if I had applied a dry oil) with a bit of a sheen.  With a cream or lotion, the skin smoothes and plumps up with moisture.  I tried this bc I was looking for something like that but even more effective, but this doesn&#x27;t work.  I may try this under a thicker lotion or cream to see if it adds anything as un under-layer.  On it&#x27;s own, it is not effective.  UPDATE ON PREVIOUS REVIEW: I have found that using it in the shower helps it absorb into the skin without leaving a dry oil residue behind.  However, even when I tried it with the matching lotion on top, it still did not fully hydrate my dry skin.  I&#x27;ll try it again in the summer.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Smells gorgeous, but not perfume-y.  Works beautifully to keep moisture in after a shower, absorbs almost instantly.  It&#x27;s a classic for a reason!</li>
    <li> Nice light oil.  Doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling sticky.</li>
    <li> Love it, have loved it for a long time.  Delightful scent and light feel.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I finally bought this. I have heard women talk about it, read about it on blogs and television. I was never a body oil fan due to one very greasy and messy experience that ruined a pair of pants. This stuff however is DELIGHTFUL!! It goes on and absorbs quickly leaving behind soft glowing skin and a subtle light fragrance that reminds me of the beach (suntan lotion and jasmine mixed with sand). I am a fan for life!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this for years. i love i. i have tattoos and it keeps the colors looking bright and new.</li>
    <li> Love this after a shower.  Enjoy the great scent and the way my skin feels when I use it.</li>
    <li> As I get older, and my skin gets drier, I&#x27;ve found that Neutrogena Body Oil is the best thing to use after a shower.  Lotions leave my skin feeling clammy.  This product lubricates and is absorbed by the skin, making it feel and look healthier.</li>
    <li> I wish I had bought the fragrance free version of this product.  I don&#x27;t mind the natural smell of sesame oil.  Added fragrance is potentially irritating to sensitive skin, and I don&#x27;t like the way the perfume in this product smells.  It isn&#x27;t offensive enough to return it, but next time I&#x27;ll get the unscented Body Oil.</li>
    <li> Great body oil after shower....have used for some time now</li>
    <li> I did not know it is scented! Wanted to use it on my newborn before his bath. It will be nice if the bottle says scented.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without this oil.  The smell takes me back to my young days on the beach.</li>
    <li> Very nice oil. Works great everywhere, even as a moisture barrier for your hair.</li>
    <li> Product is 5 star Amazon 0! I NEVER GOT IT! Just got billed!! I wouldnt care about not getting the oil but getting billed for it? I ordered 3 things thru amazon 2 came this did not. Now I have to go and search out who deals with this. i thought ordering online would make my life a little easier. Wrong! Just a different kind of hassle than going to the store. The Neutogena Sesame oil is great! i keep it in the shower and use it everyday! I am almost out and have to go buy it at the store!</li>
    <li> Very pleasant mild scent, has done wonders as daily after shower moisturizer</li>
    <li> Very light scent and makes my skin so smooth.</li>
    <li> Tried other body oils but none compare!</li>
    <li> Highly recommend.  Will leave your skin silky smooth after a shower, with a very delicate scent.  Not greasy at all.  Highly recommend. Also real bang for the buck.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Wish they still had pump bottle but I have an old one I keep refilling.</li>
    <li> Simply put, this is the silkiest body oil that has ever been on my body. I need to use it more often, but with this big old bottle now I can. Purchase Sesame!</li>
    <li> Use this as a &amp;#34;carrier oil&amp;#34; as it is so light and really penetrates the dermis very well.</li>
    <li> nice after-bath oil. my skin is always dry and got tired of applying lotion all over my body. Tried this sesame oil using a cheap spray bottle- it does the job! keeps my skin smooth, doesn&#x27;t feel sticky and smells good!</li>
    <li> I bought this with the hope of a nice, non-greasy option for massage.  True, it does absorb quickly but the smell is unpleasant and a lot stronger than some other reviews indicated.  I had to wash it off my hands and didn&#x27;t care for it at all.  I really didn&#x27;t want me or my boyfriend smelling like my grandma.  Too bad, I had high hopes from all the other reviews.</li>
    <li> It does not smell like sesame oil at all, which is good. Not like the smell of food. It actually has a very pleasant smell.  Oil is not too thick.  Nice to apply after a bath, but you can also put some on the tub when relaxing. Wife and I are using it especially more often during the winter.  It helps you to stay a little bit warm.  Helps your skin to keep it from drying.  Not bad to use for massage, but kinda expensive for that purpose.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and also have taken several bottles to Holland to give as gifts to my family. I have really dry skin and use it daily after shower while I&#x27;m still wet. It helps keep moisture in my skin and doesn&#x27;t feel oily. Try it once, I bet it won&#x27;t be the last time. BTW, I check other sources to purchase this and Amazon is still the best most of the time.</li>
    <li> I just started using this oil a few months ago. It&#x27;s  have saved my skin this winter; none of the usual itchy dry skin. As an added bonus, I noticed a surgery scar has faded and softened significantly since I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and adore it!  I get all the benefits from oiling my dry skin, but without the heavy feel, and it is easier to apply than creams.  The scent is very light and enjoyable.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product contains paraben which Dr Mercola is against, and it also contains BHT which Dr Perricone says is carcinogenic and is just added to fats and oils to preserve them. Can&#x27;t American corporations just give us what is healthy and stop poisoning us?</li>
    <li> I have always loved this body/bath oil, it has been around forever, &amp; I will use it as long as I am around!</li>
    <li> bought this for my daughter.  she loves the feel and scent of this</li>
    <li> Im not a fru-fru/girly-girl/adicted-to-Bath-and-Body-Works kinda&#x27; gal.  I just need something for my dry skin during the fall and winter.  Creams and lotions simply dont work for me in the dry, cold weather. I need body oil and I found it.  I could care less about the smell and stuff, Im just saying, it just WORKS.  Scub well in the shower, pat dry and then oil -and Im set for well into the evening. My skin is healthy, not ashy and not itchy.  My skin is smooth, supple and has a type of glow to it in certain types of lights -bonus.    That being said, I do use more than \\&quot;a few drops\\&quot; when I apply, but still, it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
    <li> It is wonderful I love using it in this  bitter cold north&lt;br /&gt;I pour it all over after my showers before drying off that&#x27;s the secret</li>
    <li> I got a little carried away and bought 5 bottles of the body oil.  Well, it&#x27;s been a long, dry winter in the Northeast and I wanted to share.  Now everyone in my family is soft to the touch...no more scaly, dry, winter-ravaged arms and legs!</li>
    <li> Love it. Use it all the time</li>
    <li> So much better than using baby oil, much lighter.</li>
    <li> This oil is great for applying after a shower or bath. It has a subtle sesame scent, I just loved it!</li>
    <li> A go to for me for many years.</li>
    <li> Smells like old ladies.</li>
    <li> so i had this on my Amazon  cart. then came across it at my local walmart. so bought it there. i wanted to start moisturizing since i rarely do. i was sooo excited.. came home used it.. really??? whats all the fuss about??? it made me ashy.. im NEVER ashy!!!!! and i rarely moisturize!.... i found a palmers oil. for skin elasticity, strech marks and scars etc. i like it.. i think they have it on amazon too. i found mine at wal-mart</li>
    <li> Light scent and works great for dry skin.</li>
    <li> love it keep myself soft</li>
    <li> I use to use this years ago, and now I remember way.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a light scented moisturizer after shower or bath.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite body oil! I put it on while I&#x27;m still damp from the shower. My skin feels wonderful and the scent is so light and pleasant!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years, often combining it with a body lotion and applying this concoction after my shower.  It makes a difference as you age and skin begins to be less elastic and does not produce as much oil.  There is no real smell either, which is great.</li>
    <li> USED it for years and now that they seemed to have stopped making them in 32 ounce bottle, this is my least inexpensive option.</li>
    <li> My whole family uses this body oil except for me lol. I&#x27;m just the exception because I just like using lotions. But my parents use it everyday and we even order in bulk when we go on vacation because we give them out to our extended family since they can&#x27;t really get this product where they live. It smells nice and its great for right when you get outta the shower. Immediately makes you skin soft and absorbs into it.</li>
    <li> Love to spray this on my skin after I shower then rinse. Leaves me feeling super soft.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping the scent would be similar to RAIN BATH, but it is not - bit strong for my taste.</li>
    <li> Body Oil delivered on time but the cap was broken.  I still my old bottle of Neutrogena body oil so I just switched out the caps  We have been having freezing temperatures so maybe the cap froze.  I did notice at the bottom of the bottle there was a small dent that I was able to smooth  out  so maybe between freezing temps and getting banged around the cap broke.  The oil it self is perfect, I used after my shower this morning :)</li>
    <li> I love the soft smell of this fragrance.. Always getting compliments.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite body oil. It has a light fragrance that doesn&#x27;t interfere with other perfumes I may wear.</li>
    <li> As a body oil it&#x27;s just fine.... I like to use a cap full in a bath. It makes my skin very soft. It will make your bathtub just disgusting though, you will have to clean it after.&lt;br /&gt;But the smell.... It&#x27;s not my favorite to begin with, but it&#x27;s ok. It&#x27;s just SO strong!!!!! I give it 3 stars because it works well and does what it supposed to, but I actually don&#x27;t use it. I can&#x27;t handle the scent, or its strength of scent I guess.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product as do the 10-12 people I have shared it with. It is great to put on right after a shower/bath, when you are still wet and don&#x27;t want to chaff or become ashy. It also does well for preventing a lot of the static cling that seems to happen in our blustery winter weather. I would whole heartedly suggest this product as a light oil body cover.</li>
    <li> Nice light oil for moisturizing skin after bath. Smells nice too.</li>
    <li> I have had an aversion to body lotions since I was a child with bad eczema.  I had to wear a lot of heavy, greasy creams to ease the chronic dryness and itching.  As an adult, I no longer struggle with eczema but have found as I have aged, my skin is dry.  Moving to Arizona didn&#x27;t help, either!  But I can&#x27;t stand to have lotion on my skin.  I only tried this product because my husband purchased it and it was in the shower.  I can&#x27;t believe the difference in my skin in less than one week!  It&#x27;s soft and smooth, I don&#x27;t itch from the dryness, and my legs are no longer white with flaking skin!  And the best part?  I don&#x27;t feel greasy!  Love this product!  Put it in the shower or near the bathtub and remember to use it while your skin is still wet!</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Body Oil is an added extra....something good especially through this exceptionally brutal winter. However, for me, it doesn&#x27;t work as well in the shower as I expected it to.  I love Neutrogena products and decided to try this.  It works just OK during the shower.  I even do as instructed...use on damp skin w/o rubbing off. I must say though, I find it works much better when I use it in the bath.  Maybe it&#x27;s the fact that it has more time to penetrate into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin &amp;amp; therefore I&#x27;m really comfortable w/Neutrogena&#x27;s light products.  I may have to get something a little stronger for the shower but for my baths...it&#x27;s good!</li>
    <li> A long term favourite.</li>
    <li> The product did seem to keep my skin hydrated when used as directed. The problem is that it has a strange \\&quot;nutty/chemically\\&quot; smell. This is especially evident when you&#x27;re moving around and your body starts to heat up. I just didn&#x27;t care for the smell.</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended this body oil for my dry and aging skin.  I was not able to purchase it in the retail stores, but was lucky to find it in Amazon.  The nice part about this oil is that once applied it does not stay oily to the touch or on clothing.  It has a nice smell also.  The only negative comment I can state is that it has to be applied to your skin while  your skin is moist.  The doctor told me to take either a shower or bath and without drying off, rub the oil all over my body and either let it self dry (only takes a moment) or just pat dry with a towel.  I love to take a really hot bath and so when standing up in what feels like a cold room, still dripping wet, I feel really chilled until dressing.  But that is little to contend with because the end result is that my skin stops itching and I feel really,really good.  I highly recommend this wonderful oil.</li>
    <li> When I found out I was pregnant. I did not want to use a simply lotion. I have always felt they just sit on the skin. I wanted something to soak into my skin. I am sooo happy I found this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it daily and am at 8 months with no stretch marks. It also seems I have barley used any. It spreads very easily. I love the smell. It also soaks in very nicely. So you are not oily for long. Its my favorite bed time routine. After the shower I feel like I have baby skin after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I defiantly would purchase again. Compared to other stretch mark oils and the prices. This one is perfect price &amp; works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> Smells good and works well....but it was delivered without a cap. So I have to be careful. Probably going to buy a new bottle to put it in.</li>
    <li> Good for light wintertime moisture.</li>
    <li> I use this every single day in the shower, before toweling off.  Keeps skin perfectly hydrated and takes less time to apply than regular lotion. I wish Amazon would add this to the subscribe and save feature, because I go through one bottle every month!</li>
    <li> I picked this up the other day because my skin has been itching like crazy this winter. After a shower, I dab my skin with a towel (so its still a little damp/wet). I apply all over like I would lotion and it instantly get absorbed into my skin and my skin feels soft and smooth without feeling greasy (I can get dressed immediately). The smells is so nice and light. I don&#x27;t know how to describe it but if you know what biosilk silk therapy smells like, this is that same kind of scent. I love it. If I could find a perfume that smells like this I would be hooked. Great stuff all around.</li>
    <li> Love It! This product is great in keeping my skin smooth and soft especially right after showering!</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and tried many different creams and lotions, which wasn&#x27;t doing it for me any longer.  I found when I use creams I had to give myself a \\&quot;waiting\\&quot; period before I didn&#x27;t feel \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; and by nighttime I felt itchy.  I decided to give this product a try, and I am so happy I did.  I put it on after a shower, and I can also put it on before bed without feeling greasy or oily, it&#x27;s perfect!  It keeps my skin soft and flake-free and has a very pleasant scent.  I am curious to see how hydrating it is in the winter when dry skin is at it&#x27;s worse.</li>
    <li> my go-to after shower oil for 15+ years. silky and leaves no residue. mild, sensual fragrance. leave it on for a minute before toweling off, i slather it all over! boyfriend constantly raving about my soft skin.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer and have been using it for 15 years. It is light, absorbs quickly, and leaves skin, well, luminous -- not exactly shiny, since it is absorbed well, but sort of shimmery (not that it has mica or any kind of makeup stuff in it).  As a bonus, it has the most heavenly scent (does not smell like cooking oil, I promise) that lingers pleasantly but subtly.   I use it for massage oil, too, because it doesn&#x27;t make an oily mess all over. It is worth every penny. I love this stuff and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
    <li> The small flip top was broken when it arrived.  It was packed with other items that weren&#x27;t harmed. It made for a messy package covered in oil.</li>
    <li> I read about 100 reviews on here and they were all super positive, so I went ahead and I bought two bottles.. One for myself and one for my son..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works wonderfully... for 10 minutes, but as soon as I stepped outside I could feel my skin drying and starting to peel.. My son had a similar experience, and he thought the substance was too oily, and that he did not like the smell.</li>
    <li> When the product was opened the top was cracked and the cover was ripped off</li>
    <li> A product that my family and I have used for many years now. Excellent for all ages!!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Leaves my skin feeling like silk...</li>
    <li> very light non-gender type aroma with great moisturizing quality - natural and light enough to apply to hair without being greasy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge Neutrogena fan and was perusing their products on Amazon when I stumbled across this. I was about to run out of lotion and needed something that could handle how dry and flaky my shins and elbows tend to get - especially now when I&#x27;m flying a lot for work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle arrived with the cap broken at the hinge unfortunately. Luckily, the oil hadn&#x27;t leaked out and gotten all over, but it does make storage kind of obnoxious right now, so I&#x27;m going to have to steal a cap from an old shampoo bottle or something to replace this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That aside, the product itself is great!  If I was choosing on fragrance alone, this wouldn&#x27;t be my first pick, but the smell is very pleasant and is growing on me. Instead of rigorously toweling myself dry after my shower, I do a cursory drying, leaving my skin quite damp and then immediately use the oil. It soaks in much better and quicker that way and can proudly say my elbows haven&#x27;t been ashy in over a week! I do also use this at times on my fully dry skin, and it&#x27;s still great, just a little more oily feeling at first.&lt;br /&gt;This product is defnitely a keeper,. I just don&#x27;t know how it took me so long to realize this exists!</li>
    <li> Love the mild scent + the oil absorbs relatively quickly and does not leave behind a residue.  The perfect massage oil.</li>
    <li> Wonderful light scent. Does not stain clothes.</li>
    <li> This oil is a must have for me in the winter.  I use it daily to moisturize my skin.  It has a nice scent my husband loves.</li>
    <li> I cringed at the idea of applying oil to my skin after getting out of the shower. But I applied as directed, and I can&#x27;t tell you how well this product retains your skin&#x27;s moisture. I haven&#x27;t purchased or used lotion or any other moisturizing product since!</li>
    <li> Totally keeps skin soft - use it right out of the shower.</li>
    <li> Ordered multiple times.  It is great after swimming.  It is the only lotion/oil that eliminates the itch on my legs.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have dry extremities, from years being out in the sun. Apply this first,when damp, than  apply my regular moisturizer, made a big diff.Yaay, baby skin. But will order fragrance free next time.It has a light orange blossom scent.Not bad, but I tend to become sensitive to fragrances.</li>
    <li> I liked the weight of the oil, it wasn&#x27;t too heavy, but the scent was way too strong for me.  All day I kept catching whiffs of it and it was giving me a headache.</li>
    <li> PRODUCT HAS PARABEN IN IT. PARABENS ARE LINKED TO OPENING THE BODY TO CANCER, PER ONCOLOGISTS. DO NOT USE ANY PRODUCTS WITH PARABENS. SHAME ON NEUTROGENA FOR USING PARABENS!</li>
    <li> its great! i battle from really dry itchy skin with areas of eczema, and after getting into the shower and lathering this on in nyc winter weather..i feel amazing!! i&#x27;m not itchy..i feel warm and healthyy..my body is smooth and comfortable..my eczema is no longer red and itchy..dry patch is still there..but only to touch..visually you wouldn&#x27;t know anything was amiss because it reduced the redness..also just for a complete understanding of my skin regimen, i exfoliated with burts bess sugar scrub prior to shower and then applied the body oil; which i am sure played a role..like many of you out there with dry skin, you know no amount of moisturizer will work on dry flaky skin unless exfoliated properly. and like many have mentioned i do use lotion afterwards, i prefer Olay body cream oil for dry skin for a body lotion..and i feel great..not dreading the old inevitable itch that is associated with extremely dry skin..i couldn&#x27;t be happier! i highly recommend this product for those suffering the itch!!</li>
    <li> We use to buy this at the local store but found they don&#x27;t carry it in the 16oz size anymore which is the better buy and half the time you can only find &amp;#34;scent free&amp;#34;,  my husband loves the scent as he puts it &amp;#34;it helps me go to sleep quicker&amp;#34; for me I would describe it as a comforting scent but either way we both love it! Thanks</li>
    <li> This is not your average review.  I am happy to report that I am soon going to be able to stop relying on Neutrogena Body Oil.  But is not because I dislike.  Rather, soon I will no longer need to use it.  I do not have dry skin.  But, I do have very severe psoriasis (the clinical diagnosis is &#x27;extreme psoriasis&#x27; actually).  One of the less desirable effects is that thick plaques form over large areas of my skin.  They become very dry.  Then they crack open and the new tissue under them tears open.  Yes, it is just as miserable and painful as the description sounds.  When that is happening and nothing you&#x27;ve tried helps, you spend a lot of you waking hours just being wretchedly miserable.  Visiting with my stepmother on the phone, she suggested this body oil to me.  I had to slather me with it a couple times a day, but it allowed me to function almost as if my skin was healthy.  If you have dry skin, this will help.  I applied it as soon as I stepped out of the shower - no toweling off.  I would start at my neck and apply all the way to my toes.  Then I would go back and repeat.  Bliss.  (Happily, I am responding to a new medication for my psoriasis so I may be able to end my dependence soon.  However, I will be happy to turn to it again if it is needed.)  Oh, I almost forgot to mention the very pleasant scent of the oil.  I don&#x27;t know how to describe it except to say that it is a clean calm pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> I put this on after i wash and am still wet it locks moisture but i use something heavier for my feet i live where the winter is heavy and harsh on your skin so this stuff is suitable.If your problem  areas are your knees and elbows then use this and a cream lotion after a month just this. Its not magic just body oil so be patient and stick with it.</li>
    <li> Has replaced all my lotions, always</li>
    <li> My co-worker (male) came in smelling like this stuff a few days ago.&lt;br /&gt;Me: Are you wearing some different product?&lt;br /&gt;Him: Yeah, it&#x27;s this sesame body oil, my girlfriend had it in the shower.Why?&lt;br /&gt;Me: Because I&#x27;ve been smelling this for the past year or so, it almost makes me puke to smell it and Is usually around elderly ladies when I smell it. I wondered what it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad to know what it is. It&#x27;s one of the most awful smells....ever.</li>
    <li> I got this bottle with the cap broken off. I do not think it is the packaging since the box itself has maintained its shape and I do not see the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; (broken off) piece of the cap in the box with it. The product was already compromised before it was even boxed, which disappoints me.</li>
    <li> I do not have very dry skin, but it does need a little &amp;#34;lubrication&amp;#34; after a shower.  This is very light, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and best of all, I don&#x27;t get a rash from it.  The fragrance is very light and doesn&#x27;t stay...so it is not offensive to others.</li>
    <li> I used a previous version of this but it was obviously fragrance free. I liked it better than putting petroleum based products on my skin and the previous version worked well. I didn&#x27;t notice this wasn&#x27;t fragrance free. After three  or four times trying to get past the smell I poured the whole 15.5 ounces down the drain. It is VERY floral, reminding me of old ladies perfumes from the 1960&#x27;s. Not pretty. Be careful on ordering, I noticed that on one offer page switching from 8.5 ounces fragrance free to 16 ounces suddenly changes to this unbearable fully fragrant variety. Amazon ought to outlaw this practice of changing sizes also changes the product!</li>
    <li> Wonderful feeling after a shower. Not too oily. Very faint smell...clean.</li>
    <li> Use it in combination with 99 cent lotion from the 99 cent store, reason makes it less grease</li>
    <li> I love this stuff - use it all the time.  Has the original sesame smell (like the clear amber soap bars) that I love.</li>
    <li> No issues, thank you.</li>
    <li> This is a nice light scented oil that can be used as a massage oil or put into bathwater. Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Okay, this stuff is fabulous.  Honestly, we use it all the time.  It is light and pleasant on your skin and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  Nice neutral smell, barely noticeable.  Great product.  I use it on my tattoo, when my skin is dry in winter.  I use it on my elbows and knees.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I use this with Neutrogena body lotion light sesame lotion.</li>
    <li> There are other oils that I like but they are so thick that I go through them quickly. This is a good oil with a very light scent that my massage clients love. It lasts longer due to needing to use less for same results that I get from thicker oils. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Doesnt hydrate as much as I would expect oil to do so, but its gentle and glides on easily after a shower. I would definitely not use this in the shower or a tub as it leaves a thin film of oil everywhere and you&#x27;ll have to scrub your shower alot more often.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve switched from body lotion to this Neutrogena Body Oil. Living in AZ is pretty dry and lotions don&#x27;t rehydrate my skin after showering like this does. I&#x27;ve tried several methods from using it right in the shower to toweling off LIGHTLY and apply this afterward. That&#x27;s the method I like the best. If I dry myself off too much and wait too long to apply the oil, I just lightly dampen my skin and then apply the oil. Great product I won&#x27;t ever be without.</li>
    <li> I love this oil, it is light and smells wonderful!!  Great for after the shower !  Will be buying again!!</li>
    <li> I have tried many different moisturizers/ oils and I keep going back to this one. This is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; for moisturizing my skin. Kinda seals my skin for protection from the dry Alaskan winter.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite thing on the planet! I have been using this body oil for years and years (15+ years). I use after shower before drying off, then my regular body lotion, makes my skin super soft and leaves a nice scent behind (if you like the smell that is, also comes unscented). I recommend to everyone and I know a lot of women who use it that also love this body oil. It is a little uncomfortable to get out of towels (also leave scent behind on them) but soaking in detergent for a few hours does the trick. Just leaves a silky soft finish on your skin, not on your clothes, great for dry winter skin.</li>
    <li> Great product. Doesn&#x27;t leave skin too oily. Great for baths.</li>
    <li> Love it. I use it for massages.</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin soft for the whole day.  It smells good, but not too strong.  It can make your shower slick if you spill it</li>
    <li> Wonderful for stretch marks</li>
    <li> Stops itchy skin and great for rough hands, elbows.  Not greasy .  Love it &amp; it smells good too.  Good for men also</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell.  It sat on our bedroom counter for six months and I finally threw the entire bottle away.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just a bottle of baby oil.  I used it one time after a shower and went straight back to my Curel moisturizer.  Don&#x27;t know why people said it is not greasy, b/c it certainly is greasy.  It&#x27;s just oil!  If you&#x27;ve ever used baby oil on you skin, then you already know exactly what this will be like.  Wasn&#x27;t the wonderful after shower moisturizing experience I was hoping for (and that reviews indicted it would be), but was cheap and fine as an oil.  I might use it for sunbathing.  Or give to someone else.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again though.</li>
    <li> I have tried all kinds of oils over the years to combat dry skin.  I love this Neutrogena body oil, I love the large bottle it comes in, it has a great flip top that makes it easy to use, without making a huge oily mess.  It smells great, it goes on smoothly and is easy to blend in.  I will be ordering more of this, it works so well.  It has helped me get rid of a patch of very dry skin I had on the back of my neck.  I just put this on after a shower, when the skin is still moist.  It really moisturizes and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
    <li> I mix this with my regular lotion to make a nice silky feel</li>
    <li> Love this product. I mix it after each shower with some moisturizing lotion and my skin GLOWS the entire day without being greasy. I have used this product in the past for an extended period (6 months) and noticed considerable results on the long-term smoothness/softness of my skin.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and how light it is.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this and she must like it because I haven&#x27;t heard she doesn&#x27;t and believe me I would hear.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this formulation, but haven&#x27;t used it in many years. After trying it all over again, I&#x27;m relieved that the smell/feel hasn&#x27;t changed. I highly recommend it for those of you who live in cold weather climates, as it heals dry skin, and relieves itchiness. It also has a very gentle and subtle scent that lasts throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it but what I read so far doesn&#x27;t make me want to buy it.</li>
    <li> I love the product and have used it for many years. My store stopped carrying this size and I made my purchase online :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful!  I use it as soon as I&#x27;ve toweled off after a shower.  Makes my skin sooo smooth and moisturized (I have very dry skin) and it smells absolutely amazing!  Soaks in fairly fast, so you can get dressed soon after.  Doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling oily or sticky.  I&#x27;ve already got my daughter and sister-in-law hooked as well.  I would definitely recommend to others!!</li>
    <li> Been using this for years, love it</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil regularly since my teens (I am now in my 40&#x27;s).  The formula has never changed, because it&#x27;s perfect.  Light, absorbs quickly, moisturizes, skin looks and smells great all day, and also blends with other fragrances easily if you are a perfume wearer (I&#x27;m not, but have friends who do layer this with other scents).  Great price for the big bottle here on Amazon, and it will last a once-a-day user  a good long while - mine lasts about 3 months.</li>
    <li> Wonderfully decadent and soothing!</li>
    <li> Always a must for wonderful skin.</li>
    <li> I shower and instead of drying, rub my body all over with this oil.  It leaves my skin as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  I have been using oil on my skin for about ten years and this and coconut oil are my favorites.  This is lighter than coconut oil and is better absorbed more quickly.  I still use coconut oil on problem areas and my feet and hands.  This is a nice light oil, with a very subdued smell that is well absorbed.  I would recommend this to anyone, as long as you are not allergic to sesame.</li>
    <li> The product is good but it came with the lid broken, so I have to be careful with it or it will leak everywhere.</li>
    <li> I love this.  My legs get so dry in the winter and this helps tremendously.  It smells so good too.  I use it on my arms and chest too and the scent lasts all day.  Soft skin, great scent.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> Never a bad buy! My mom loves this stuff. I bought it on Amazon because it tends to be a little cheaper then the stores.</li>
    <li> This is so soft and just soaks into your skin and smells nice and light.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling oily.  I use my wash cloth after my bath and pour the Sesame oil onto the cloth and rub my body down with it.  I don&#x27;t put it into my bath water because I&#x27;m afraid of slipping and falling.</li>
    <li> I live on this stuff all through the winter. I get dry skin during the cold season and after a shower I go out of my mind with an itchy back or other itchy spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is a miracle. I do my normal shower routine and right before I turn off the water, I smooth a little of this on my back, arms, legs, etc..... then I just stand there for another minute and I&#x27;m done. It works all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, if you get itchy, use this stuff and keep stocked up. I swear by it.</li>
    <li> A friend suggested I buy this and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  The smell is light and delicious and it goes on so smoothly.  It isn&#x27;t a heavy oil.  Very light.  Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it will help with winter dry skin though.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this product.  Thank you Amazon for making it affordable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super lazy and hate taking the time putting lotion on after I get out of the shower. Just a little bit of Neutrogena Body Oil in the shower helps keep my skin soft without feeling oily. Because it&#x27;s a liquid formula, I don&#x27;t have to worry about rubbing it into my skin until it disappears the way I would lotion. It saves me time and helps my skin stay hydrated. The only issue I have with the product is that it smells slightly &amp;#34;old-ladyish&amp;#34;. At first, I was a little disappointed but realized it doesn&#x27;t leave a strong smell. All in all, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for years and still love it.  Very light but it smells great and absorbs quickly</li>
    <li> Smells bad. Not sure if it work because I can&#x27;t get passed the smell.</li>
    <li> Excellent for removing grease, paint and adhesives from your hands.</li>
    <li> Always a good buy! love it</li>
    <li> This is a light sesame body oil....just as it says.  Just enough to give a shine to your skin.  Nothing heavy like baby oil.  Perfect for after the beach or pool.</li>
    <li> I started using this last winter when my skin was so dry from the cold weather - and it works beautifully!  I put it on just after a shower when I&#x27;m still wet, then put lotion on over the top of it to seal it in.  I can&#x27;t recommend this strongly enough.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff it leaves my skin so smooth and Absorbs into my skin very well makes my skin look very nice and it don&#x27;t leave your skin feeling oily like other products. Ever since I started using this I don&#x27;t even use any other lotion or oils  anymore this is all I need....  very happy with this oil will alway buy :)</li>
    <li> Light weight and smells great!  Perfect after a shower and absorbs quickly!</li>
    <li> Enjoy this body oil after a shower applied to damp skin. The light fragrance is fresh and clea. This is an easy &amp; fast fix&lt;br /&gt;to dry skin.</li>
    <li> We used it for a massage lotion, it works great and didn&#x27;t stain.  Felt really good on the hands as well as the body and lasts forever.</li>
    <li> Began buying this years ago.  My husband loves it.  Use it after showering for smooth, moisturized skin.  Especially good for cold weather climates and after gym workout.  Nice light scent.  Good price.</li>
    <li> Wonderful skin smoother after a shower</li>
    <li> I highly recommed this product..I been using this over a yr. Light scent and works well.  I would buy againg and I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love it - makes skin feel silky smooth.</li>
    <li> i use this all the time to give massages.. its smells good feels good</li>
    <li> I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I use it every time after I shower and before I dry myself. Keeps my skin soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and does not stain my cloth.</li>
    <li> Soft and luminous skin effect, love this product</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that helps my constant dry skin.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this since like 2001ish and I cant seem to use anything else for longer than a week, i begin to miss this oil very quickly! It smells amazing and feels amazing and there is just no other product that I love as much.</li>
    <li> Great Product.  Costco no longer has it in stock.</li>
    <li> I heard great things about this stuff so I went to the local drugstore to get some. I wanted unscented but they didn&#x27;t have it so I got this instead. The oil itself is nice; I used it in combination with a body cream for these very dry winter months. However, the smell is truly awful and it consistently gave me headaches. Not only that, but the smell permeates through all layers of clothing and lingers until you wash them. I just could not get past the headache-inducing smell so I had to throw it out. I&#x27;m going to stick with one-ingredient, edible and non-stinky oils, like coconut or almond.</li>
    <li> This product is not sold in our stores anymore. It is the best smelling oil and it is light. Just follow the directions. The price was great.</li>
    <li> The product arrived in a box wtih no packing material.  The black cap was broken and the safety seal was ripped.  The product had leaked all over the inside of the box.  Seriously?!</li>
    <li> LOVE this body oil.  It&#x27;s super light, smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes.  Leaves me with super soft skin all day.</li>
    <li> Wish Neutrogena had kept their unscented formula.</li>
    <li> This body oil is super greasy and not really easy to wash off which makes it perfect for extra-dry skin.</li>
    <li> Smells, absorbs and is simply amazing! Purchased by word of mouth and no regrets! Worth every cent!</li>
    <li> Love this oil.  I tend to mix it with my Jergens lotion and this combination has been phenomenal on my skin.  It does not work well for me by just using it alone as I have read with some reviews.  It was suppose to be delivered between the 10th and the 15th however it came a day earlier(the 9th) so I was very happy about this.  The cost was great too considering I would have spent almost $20 for this size.</li>
    <li> I have been fanatical about my skin for over twenty years, and this is the best product I&#x27;ve tried hands down.  I use this every day, and it hydrates my skin without a greasy/oily feeling and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.  After my bath or shower, I simply use my wrung out wash cloth to dry myself, leaving my skin slightly damp.  Then I rub the oil in small amounts and my skin is in perfect condition every day.  I will say that I don&#x27;t have especially dry skin, but I drink lots of water, and I care in this way for my skin every day with few exceptions - maybe 10 days out of a year, and I have done this for over two decades.  If you do these things, they help a lot.  Take it from a nice skin junkie, this is definitely worth the try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, if you don&#x27;t like the scent, there&#x27;s an unscented version.  The scent doesn&#x27;t move me one way or the other, but people tell me I smell good, they say I have a scent and a few people have gotten attached to it, so on some subconscious level, it must be nice to get a whiff of!  :)</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! It smells great, it&#x27;s easy to use, saves me time in the morning, and keeps me moisturized all day. Neutragena Body Oil has earned a spot in my morning routine for life.</li>
    <li> I use this oil in  my bath. I have after the bath smooth touch in my skin.</li>
    <li> good nice neutral smell</li>
    <li> Makes a great massage oil. Add a blend of earth and wood synergy essential oils by earths garden.  On first day I told my husband it  smelled like turpentine.  After sitting for a day the smell turned out to be musky , sweet and very sensual.  Really a sexy blend.  Sinfully sexy.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, keeps your skin moisturized and doesn&#x27;t require a lot as a small amount works very, very well. Doesn&#x27;t leave residue and absorbs into your skin very quickly while still retaining moisture. As usual, Neutrogena knows their stuff and this product comes easily recommended.</li>
    <li> Same old great product I&#x27;ve used for decades.</li>
    <li> Use to moisturize winter (dry) skin at end of shower before drying off. Pretty much eliminates itching! Yay!</li>
    <li> I have used this for years, and now in my 50&#x27;s really need it  in the NW.  Just after a shower, rub in wet warm skin. it really works, and smells divine, but is not obnoxious, I dislike fragrance in lotions, but love this one . the price is divine also, and a lot more than I got from the local store. a bottle this size lasts me about 9 months. so it is a good buy for the quality.</li>
    <li> This oil did nothing for my dry skin. I did not appreciate the smell either. I have bumpy skin in my legs and this oil made the bumps worse. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Two days after I started using this product, which I love, I noticed that my skin was mush smoother and shinier than it had been before. I love the way it smells, and after using it and then going out, I&#x27;ve gotten complements on my perfume, even though this body oil is all that I was wearing. I put it on mysking while it&#x27;s still damp, just when I get out of the shower. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> love it!! love the smell</li>
    <li> I love this oil!  It&#x27;s light yet moisturizing. Because of allergies  I can&#x27;t handle strong scents and this is perfect because it has a light pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and I just love it. It smells great and if you put it on before you dry off after a shower or bath, it seems to seal in moisture and make you feel good because you know you smell good. I get more compliments on this product than I do many of my expensive perfumes. This has been a staple of my routine for probably 20 years now and I will continue to use it. The price is decent and it lasts a long time as you don&#x27;t need to use too much each day. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who might enjoy a new scent with their moisturizer. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Great product and fair price in comparison</li>
    <li> I like the smell, but does not leave my skin hydrated all day long.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!  I started using this product several years ago after traveling to the Virgin Islands and being bitten by no-seeums.  I read somewhere that the bugs don&#x27;t like sesame oil so thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  Well, after several more trips back to the islands and with very few bites, I continue to use this product year round.  I like the scented formula and it is not at all greasy.  Leaves skin very soft.</li>
    <li> One of best body oils on the market. Great smell and it definitely moisturizes the skin adequately. A little goes a long way so I would suggest getting a spray bottle (I use a Skin So Soft spray bottle) to prevent waste.</li>
    <li> Smells great and the price is far better than finding this product at a local retailer.</li>
    <li> Smells great, and it doesn&#x27;t leave your body feeling to oily like other products.  It gives my skin a healthy glow, and the price on here is great.  I would see this at my local drug stores all the time, but I felt it cost to much.  Finally I saw it on here and decided to try it.  I love it, but I still would not buy it at the drugstore for their price.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this.  At first I thought the smell was nice.  Now  . . . it is nauseating, everywhere, and gives me a headache.  I just ordered him the unscented.  I hope it is better.  Beware if you are sensitive to odors!</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with the Neutrogena Body Oil.  It is not greasy and makes my skin feel wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin.  This seemed to be doing wonders for my legs/arms.  But after three days, I broke out in the worse rash I&#x27;ve ever had.  The itching drove me crazy &amp; this lasted a week.  I suggest you try it first on a small area.  And, not just &#x27;one time&#x27;, but for a few days.  (Takes a while if you&#x27;re allergic).  Other wise, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a great product for those who can tolerate the ingredients.</li>
    <li> Great product. Moisturizers without an oily feel and does not clog your pores. Love this !</li>
    <li> I purchased this product due to a recommendation of a friend. She used it to help prevent stretch marks while she was pregnant. I know that stretch marks are more genetic than anything else, but so far so good. I am getting close to the end of my pregnancy and no stretch marks! I not only love the results, but I also love the feel of this body oil as well as the smell. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This oil did wonders for my eczema! I felt relief almost immediately after this stuff touched my skin, even on my worst patch. After a warm bath, blot excess water off your skin and apply a generous amount of the Neutrogena Body Oil to your skin and it really helps!    The scent is nice too :)</li>
    <li> This oil not only feels good but it helped my partner&#x27;s rash problem.  My partner does not lke creams but with this product there is no problem.  Also it helps increase sexual attraction and an overwhelming feeling of calmness and serenety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kiss your partner&#x27;s neck with your lips and breath in through your nose at the same time.  Your lips will feel extra sensitive and a combination of incense from the sesame oil and your partner&#x27;s own natural smell will combine into an intense desireable fragrance.</li>
    <li> Works like magic after a shower.</li>
    <li> Ahh smooth and silky on my skin. Great scent and dries easily.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks and my skin is more moist and is looking healthier. I also love the sme is not so strong and can go with your perfume without interrupting the perfume smell.. I LOVE THIS OIL..  It is also not oily and dries quickly.. I even i apply to my 2 year old daughter after the shower..</li>
    <li> Really good for my dry skin. And it smells good.</li>
    <li> I love it. I&#x27;ve used it for years. It&#x27;s odorless and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy like some other brands I tried.</li>
    <li> I have been using Neutrogena Body Oil for years and used to buy it at Costco and they no longer carry it.  Amazon has the best price that I have found.  The oil is better than any lotion you can find.  So if you have dry itchy skin than this is just the thing you need, it also works great for messages.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
    <li> This oil smells awful - smells like old lady perfume mixed commercial-grade air freshener.  And unfortunately, the smell is strong and lasts all day too. It&#x27;s too bad, since it is actually very moisturizing and gave my skin a nice sheen. But the smell is just horrible. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I have allergies and the scent of many products causes problems for me.  This is one of the few scented products I have been able to use.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I use this body oil after my shower every day. I didn&#x27;t like the scent of the other body oils I tried, but this is very pleasant.</li>
    <li> Much better than baby oil if you put it on Freshly dried off skin.  It soaks into the skin and gives a glow.</li>
    <li> I use this after each shower and it makes my skin feel particularly soft - even in winter months.  It is very light and non greasy.  I would highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> it smells very good; and feels light...</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t stand body lotions and creams. This is a great alternative to those heavy,heavily scented products. I also like it much better than baby oil because it is more easily absorbed (because it is sesame, and not mineral oil) I love the fresh, very light, scent. It goes on easily (I put some in a spritz bottle for those harder to reach places on my back) and is quickly absorbed.</li>
    <li> Have used this oil for about 29 years. Yes, I love it.</li>
    <li> love the scent. and it provides great lubrication for all activities.  great body lotion.</li>
    <li> I apply this immediately after drying off from the shower, and it soaks right in without feeling greasy.  Just feel nice and soft all day.  Some days I need something heavier for my feet and elbows, but for allover moisture, this is perfect.  The scent is nice going on, then fades and is very subtle, although I do think when I renew, I&#x27;ll get the unscented just to be sure it&#x27;s not competing with my perfume.</li>
    <li> The Neutrogena Body Oil has a very nice smell to it. I rub it on my body right before I&#x27;m about to get out of the shower. It seems to absorb and doesn&#x27;t feel like I have a pound of Crisco sitting on my skin.</li>
    <li> I was so pleased to find this on Amazon.com. I am English and used to be able to buy it like this and in an atomiser for easy dispersing. I live in Australia and this product is not availble at all. The size of the bottle is great value for money and it does wonders for your skin after shpwering.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this oil.  I haven&#x27;t used it in a while, so I was thrilled to get it for such a good price.  I use it on my wet skin right after a shower or bath.....it&#x27;s WONDERFUL!!!  It&#x27;s light and not greasy at all.  The smell is divine, but not overpowering; you can still wear your favorite perfume or body spray and it won&#x27;t clash.  It&#x27;s also great as a cuticle oil.</li>
    <li> good product, but it has a bad smell</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go without this for one day. Better than any lotion. Keeps your body shinning &amp; oily all day long.</li>
    <li> Super and well-priced</li>
    <li> Was a little disappointed to see that Propylparaben and BHT were listed in the ingredients.  Rather than using preservatives in the oil, would rather risk it going rancid at which time I would just toss it away and buy new.</li>
    <li> I have been using this every day for a few years.  I keep the oil right by the shower, and it keeps my skin soft.</li>
    <li> Love the oil and isn&#x27;t too &#x27;perfumey&#x27;...it&#x27;s more of natural spice scent, not flowery and obnoxious...</li>
    <li> This cured my winter dry skin.  I apply in the shower.</li>
    <li> Not an effective moisturizer (for me, anyway). It feels and smells perfectly nice. After use, my skin feels even drier and itchier than it did before I used it; it also seems to create a barrier on my skin: lotion applied after the oil (later in the day, for example) doesn&#x27;t help at all. Looks like I&#x27;ll be getting rid of this and going back to a shea butter-heavy lotion.</li>
    <li> THIS IS SUCH A GREAT BODY OIL! THE SMELL IS SO &#x27;SOFT&#x27; IT MAKES YOUR SKIN FEEL SO SILKY,I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Just a note -- this stuff is awesome.  However the listed per ounce price at $0.53 is incorrect, it is $0.83 -- so the 32 oz size is a better deal!</li>
    <li> This is great not that many stores carry this now and the ones that do sell it for alot more.</li>
    <li> I love the way this smell and feels.  Usually I use this in the summer because it&#x27;s so light, but covers well.  This past winter though, I layered it under my thicker lotions and my skin felt wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for more than a year now.  I just love the smell and how light it feels on my skin.  I&#x27;m happy, too, that it comes in big bottles.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic. I didn&#x27;t think I would like oil instead of lotion, but this is fantastic. Mild fragrance which is very pleasant.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it. It&#x27;s her go to post shower moisturizer now. The scent is unique but pleasant. Nothing more to say really, except that you should consider transferring it to a clean pump bottle to control how much you use at a time; the bottle it comes in is a little difficult to use.</li>
    <li> My favorite body oil in the whole world, it has a really great smell, it leaves your skin very soft and smooth&amp;#62; i have been using this product for years and I will definetly cotinue to buy it</li>
    <li> Works great on my dry skin in my dry climate.  Keeps me moisturized without the stickiness of lotion.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s quick easy and refreshing</li>
    <li> Great product. Arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> Loved the price and ease of getting this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years!  I apply in the shower after I turn off the water.  I have especially dry and sensitive skin, so this works well to keep my hydrated, even if I forget to put lotion on afterward.  Do not use when you are using fake tanning products as it will remove the color and make it harder for new product to adhere to your skin.  Great for winter when skin is driest!  I love the smell (sesame).</li>
    <li> Very nice, a good fix for dry skin.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both use this body oil - love the scent, it really helps keep the flaky dry skin under control.  We also use the Neutrogena Moisture Rich Body Wash (the dark blue color).  I have been using this body oil on and off for decades.  It&#x27;s a tried and true.</li>
    <li> user for years Love it</li>
    <li> I used to use baby oil, but since I came across the sesame formula I switched to this.  Feels light on your skin, smells great, and goes on easy.</li>
    <li> If I was asked to pick my favorite beauty product, Neutrogena body oil would be the hands down winner.  I love the smell, the way it softens my skin and the fact that is so easy to apply.  I highly recommend this to anyone who is wants to keep their skin looking fabulous.</li>
    <li> Alba body lotion works better for me.  My skin was still rather  dry after applying and I got painful itching and hives on back and shoulders.  Not for me.</li>
    <li> I like the oil, but it has parabens which I&#x27;m not in love with.  I like the scent and way it feels...but next time I will get straight up jojoba oil to avoid creepy preservatives.</li>
    <li> This is a great massage oil. It is light and silky smooth not heavy and greasy where the first thing the person wants is to &amp;#34;get this stuff off of me&amp;#34;. It helps the skin and can be left on. The wife love it.</li>
    <li> love love love. been using in the shower for years. light scent that fades in no time at all and no one else can smell it.</li>
    <li> This has an odd aroma. I rarely use it and it isn&#x27;t cheap!</li>
    <li> This is perfect for dryer climates. I sometimes mix this together with my regular body lotion that is in a pump dispenser for that satin smooth feel.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> One of the WORST!! My arms and lega which i applied the oil on are covered with small red pimples!! It irritated my skin. I have to mention that i have sensitive skin so if you have sensitive skin don&#x27;t buy it ..</li>
    <li> I love this. it leaves .my skin feeling soft with no oily feeling.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Hard to find in stores but moisturizers wonderfully.  Absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t leave you oily for hours.</li>
    <li> Good price for a great product !  I have tried cheaper brands, and they work well, but Neutrogena by far is my favourite.  Moisture stays with you, without being to greasy or slippery.&lt;br /&gt;Can be applied over wet, damp, or dry skin with outstanding results.&lt;br /&gt;Combats dryness, soothes legs after shaving, makes my décolletage look younger , smooths over any stretch marks, makes skin feel sexy and well taken care of.&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend. One happy customer.&lt;br /&gt; Other notes :  I actually smooth what is left on my hands into my hair after a nightly shower, to retain moisture and make hair feel silkier.  I have fragile , baby fine hair after having chemotherapy for breast cancer some years ago , and this seems like a good extra moisturizer to help protect my hair as I sleep.&lt;br /&gt;As well, as the breast and chest area, to relieve tightness after having had breast reconstruction, and help skin stay supple in that delicate area.</li>
    <li> Lightly scented. I put it on before I get out of the shower. Then blot dry. Its great for this time of year.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, just enough moisture to keep your skin from being dry.  Excellent for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I truly recommend this product. You can use it all year round.</li>
    <li> This product is great and arrived in fantastic condtion, well sealed - no spills.  love it on my skin</li>
    <li> I love Neutrogena Body Oil</li>
    <li> this is a light oil that I like to apply while I&#x27;m still wet from my shower/bath - that&#x27;s all I need for the warm months and in the colder weather I used it as a top coat after I apply a thicker body butter.  I enjoy the smell and sometimes add a little to my hair.</li>
    <li> Great! Absorbs quickly. Non-greasy feeling. Love, love, love!</li>
    <li> I buy this from Amazon, because I cannot find these bigger bottles in a store. I use alot of product for extremely dry skin and this works rather well. The oil smells wonderful and is light. It goes on smoothly and doesnt take alot of it. My only issue is that it wears off before the day is up. My skin absorbs this rather quickly so my legs begin to peel by the evening if I have shaven. I found and purchashed the lotion which I gave five stars. It stays on all day and evening and smells just as good. I continue to buy the oil to use in the bath and to use when I am sunbathing.</li>
    <li> This product is hands down, the most effective I have ever found at ruining sheets. Because I liked the texture of the oil I used it for a treatment... once. My new sheets were hideously stained after one use. This product has a fantastic ability to wick through cotton, permanently bind to the fibers, and turn yellow-brown. I&#x27;ve never used another oil like it and I&#x27;ve been in practice nearly 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ha! You say. You&#x27;re not a massage therapist. Why should you care? Because if it can do that to my sheets, it can do that to your shirts, your pants, and your bed-linen if you oil yourself up and go to bed without putting a rubber mat down first. Don&#x27;t say I didn&#x27;t warn you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the smell is... inexplicable. Why, Neutrogena. Why?</li>
    <li> Love this oil. My dry skin is a memory not a reality, no longer have to buy other lotions .</li>
    <li> My go to moisturizer straight after a shower.  Love it.  Light, absorbs quickly, no stickiness, and smells move too,  I have used it for years.  And it does keep your skin from drying out.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  Used in or out of the shower it leaves the skin feeling soft and smooth.  No greasy feeling.  A nice soft scent too.  Happily recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> The Neutrogena body oil has been an absolutely wonderful product for me.  I dealt with very dry, itchy and cracking skin on my arms and legs for several years and multiple visits to my doctor and recommended dermatologists did little to relieve the problem with diagnoses ranging from a possible mite infestation to psoriasis or eczema.  One dermatologist did say it was just dry skin and to stop taking a shower each day.  I finally ended up at an allergist who recommended I try a body oil after each shower.  Just so happened that my local warehouse club had a 40 ounce bottle of Neutrogena body oil for sale and I tried it.  That was several years and many bottles ago, and I haven&#x27;t had a dry skin problem since.  I l really like the pleasant light sesame fragrance.  The Amazon subscribe-and-save program has worked well for me with regular deliveries as I need them.  Wish the 40 ounce size was still available but I don&#x27;t find it anywhere.  I recommend this product to anyone with dry skin problems or who justs want to maintain their healthy skin with a pleasantly scented body oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and I love it.  It&#x27;s not heavy, oily nor greasy and sinks into your skin.  I use it when I&#x27;m in the shower and put it on still wet skin.  Lovely feel and nice light fragrance.</li>
    <li> Great massage oil that works well and smells great.  Easy on the hands, but will stain sheets.  Washes out nicely.  Try it heated.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and really appreciate it after shaving.  Sometimes I am in such a hurry I forget to apply lotion.  But this has been a longstanding routine of mine in the shower.  If I combine it with lotion though, the results are that much better.  Have my husband using it now too.  Huge bottle lasts a long time and is a good value as a result.  Haven&#x27;t found a better product to replace it.</li>
    <li> Nice gentle aroma, easy on skin!  It&#x27;s Neutrogena.</li>
    <li> Great for dry winter skin with out feeling greasy. Light smell. Won&#x27;t cause you to break out so great for combination skin.</li>
    <li> This oil leaves such a soft feeling and amazing smell! I highly recommend this to my fellow ladies! You will not be dissapointed.</li>
    <li> Very light oil. No discernible odor so doesn&#x27;t get in the way of other scents you might wear; non greasy so clothing is not ruined. I like it!</li>
    <li> Love it ! Leaves me skin so soft !! Quick and easy to put on after I shower.</li>
    <li> My all time favorite body oil.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin so soft and smooth. I have been using this product for many years. It is great for when you come out of the shower.</li>
    <li> Nuetrogena Body Oil is the best body oil for my skin type (dry in winter). It smells so very clean and is not heavy, absorbing without residue. This should be a staple in everyone&#x27;s shower.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite - just the right amount of scent to it.</li>
    <li> Lovely subtle scent; nice oil.</li>
    <li> Great skin care product!</li>
    <li> The product itself is really good, leaves my skin hydrated but not too oily. I am just disappointed when I received it that the cap is broken. Too much bother to return so I just use empty bottle spray and refill it with this and problem solved.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. Before I get out of the shower, it turn the water on HOT.. Let it get steamy. Then turn off the water and then apply. Great on the elbows and knees . The fragrance is ok but it is a great moisturizer and not oily.</li>
    <li> Living in cold weather most of the year (it seems anyway) I tend to have very dry skin.  I have been using this product for several years and love the product.  Package arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  Would buy from this seller again!</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my mom. She has been trying to find just the oil for a longtime. It was exactly what she was looking for and Amazon had the best price.</li>
    <li> Love this body oil for when we do back rubs, have been using this kind for years, will keep buying</li>
    <li> I love this lightly sesame oil.  It makes my skin feel like silk after a shower.  It keeps my skin smooth and f&lt;br /&gt;soft.</li>
    <li> Have used it for years.  Has a very nice smell.</li>
    <li> I love Neutrogena Body Oil.  I used to have keratosis pilarsis on the backs of my arms - those dry bumps that form, most often on the arms.  I have really always had it - but after I started putting this on after a shower they went away.  I use the body oil after every shower.  Ideally, you rub it on while you are still damp, but I refer to dry off a little bit.  It really keeps my skin from getting real dry during the winter.  I love the smell, and you can put on clothes right away.</li>
    <li> I use this right after I shower and love that it&#x27;s clear, light, and has a nice fragrance.  Great for my skin too, especially during long dry winters.</li>
    <li> Love this product... it does wonders for my skin...I now buy it for gifts to share this eith friends and family.</li>
    <li> I live in the southwest and my skin really dries out in the winter. After I shower I slather myself with this stuff and it makes my skin feel so much better. Smells good too!</li>
    <li> The product is wonderful.Keeps your skin nice and soft during all of these cold winter days and nights. Has a great scent to it, nothing too strong just subtle., But, I  found 2 for this price at Bj&#x27;s so I was disappointed to see that..</li>
    <li> I use this product daily after showering and before drying off.  It&#x27;s light and smells good, but it doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue.  It makes a big difference with my dry skin.</li>
    <li> I love the scent, my skin feels so smooth, without feeling greasy,  and it absorbs well.&lt;br /&gt;Me n my husband use it daily and fight over the last drop.</li>
    <li> It does work very well, but it gives me and anyone standing near me a headache from the smell.  No was is it &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34;.  Perhaps if is smelled nutty like sesame oil, it would be fine, but it has a perfume in it.  Those with a perfume sensitivity, beware!</li>
    <li> I love this body oil.  It is thin and makes the skin feel smooth.</li>
    <li> Applying this oil to my moist body has been a part of my shower routine for years.  The combination of this oil and lotion keeps my body very soft; especially in winter months.</li>
    <li> I really love the way it makes my skin feel.  I put it on right out of the shower and it soaks in and leaves my skin feeling so smooth, but not greasy.</li>
    <li> It does the three things I want.&lt;br /&gt;- Works as massage oil&lt;br /&gt;- Helps dry skin&lt;br /&gt;- Smells great when applying and stays consistent throughout the day (just a little less intense as the day goes on of course)</li>
    <li> I love the light smell, I was even complemented on it! Very light, soaks right in to your skin. I really love this product! I would have given it 5 stars, but the bottle really needs a pump!! The pop up top lends to the oil running down the side of the bottle and on to the vanity or other surface, and from your hands to the bottle again.&lt;br /&gt; I would recommend you purchase a pump, or another pump bottle to put it in. I added a pump to my bottle and it is more efficient and no more drips. So, Neutrogena, how about offering your oil with a pump, like your lotion has??</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product to improve the skin on my legs.  You smooth it on, towel if off, and follow up with a moisturizing cream.  Your towels get oily, but your skin feels smooth and nice.  It can be messy pouring it right out of the 16-ounce bottle, so I pour some into a smaller container that I refill after it&#x27;s used up.</li>
    <li> KEEPS SKIN SOFT AND SMELLS GREAT.</li>
    <li> Love it. Gives me a sense of luxury.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love My Neutrogena Sesame Oil</li>
    <li> Nice oil but I wasn&#x27;t too fond of the smell. Ended up giving it to my mom.</li>
    <li> I am trying to get rid of celluite on my legs and thighs...I know that it will take some time because it has been on my legs for many years.  I  love the way it smells and I just might have a chance to get rid of celluite.  It is easy to rub in and it does not stay oily when you rub it in really well. I do like this product.</li>
    <li> This is soooooo lux and the fragrance is soooooo nice. Very subtle, not greasy at all, very light. Had my grandbaby overnite and after her bath put it on her. My daughter called the next day to find out what I put on her because she loved the smell. Light enough to even use in warm weather.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a man, but I still suffer from dry skin in winter.  I&#x27;ve tried lotions and creams, but nothing really seemed to do the job right. .. and then.. I was introduced to Neutrogena Body Oil.  What a difference!!  When I finish my shower I rub a few small teaspoons into my still damp self.. then let it soak in as I squeegee the walls of the shower.  I can then dry off as usual and go about my day with hydrated skin.  I&#x27;m dropping a star from my review solely because I&#x27;d prefer an oil that wasn&#x27;t scented (the wife likes the Light Sesame smell.. but I don&#x27;t).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys, you don&#x27;t need to suffer the scratchy elbows or the dry eczema patches.. a little oil after your shower can make you more comfortable, and may draw your wife in a little closer..</li>
    <li> My skin feels so youthful and I love that it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores:)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best!  I put in my bath water and put it on my legs and arms when u want them to shine like when I wear a dress. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Would highly recommend this body oil.  Goes on easily, smells great, feels great.  Have used lots of other lotions etc., but find this extremely good.</li>
    <li> I have been using Neutrogena scented oil after every bath and shower I have taken since my teens.  I step out of the shower and immediately put a light coating all over while I&#x27;m still wet before toweling dry.  I think it seals in the moisture after bathing.  It has kept my skin baby soft and looking years younger than my age.  I have had many compliments on the softness of my skin over the years, from people who seem simply amazed that my skin can be so smooth and soft!&lt;br /&gt;I also do not like wearing perfume, so the light, shower fresh scent of this oil is the only scent I wear.  It&#x27;s a very natural scent, which I have also gotten compliments on, as people simply think I smell good naturally, so no fake , over powering perfumey smell.</li>
    <li> Soaks right in and does not get on clothes. Moisturizing lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin feel fantastic.  No more itching!</li>
    <li> I use body lotion at least once a day.  In the winter my skin gets extremely dry.  I usually buy extra thick lotion to compensate&lt;br /&gt;for the dry weather.  I saw this online and thought I would give it a try since the reviews seem to be pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dislike the smell the moment I open the bottle. I&#x27;m not allergic to any fragrance.  In fact, most of my face and body moisturizers have fragrance in them.  This oil has a very strong chemical fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the oil after my shower and it seems to work well.  It absorbs quickly and my skin feels smooth and no dryness.  I like its functionality, just not the smell.  Next time I&#x27;ll try the fragrance-free one if it&#x27;s available.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this stuff, use it every time I shower or bathe.  My skin feels softer and smells great!</li>
    <li> This body oil has replaced lotion.  Wonderful scent and is quickly absorbed.</li>
    <li> best oil you can buy. love it. the fragrance is more suited for us girls. its fabulous. buy it now</li>
    <li> I love the smell. It makes me relaxed. No sticky but smooth</li>
    <li> Use all over body after shower or bath when your body is slightly wet.  Skin is very moisturized.  Feel good all day!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Love this oil hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> A must for after a shower.</li>
    <li> A lovely, after shower addition, which leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. I love the way it glides on. It not too heavy or greasy.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I want to start by explaining that I really don&#x27;t wear perfume or body spray because I&#x27;m so sensitive to the chemical smells in almost all of them. Same goes for body wash and lotion.  I have to use all natural products including essential oils and that gets very expensive!  This body oil really helped overcome a lot of that.  It feels wonderful on my skin, it moisturizes my skin but it&#x27;s not too greasy when it dries and the smell is fabulous! I get a lot of compliments on my &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I had used Sesame oil previously but it was bought for me as a gift, so I could never find it. I stumbled across this and oh boy... found myself in hog heaven. I love it, the smell, the feel, and it works so well on my skin. Great product... get yourself some ASAP!</li>
    <li> great stuff - my daughter&#x27;s favorite.  And she is more than picky about her products, especially for skin care.  Yay!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT,  SMELLS GREAT, SKIN FEELS GREAT</li>
    <li> NICE LIGHT FRAGRANCE and NOT GREASY.</li>
    <li> Good product! Smell good! I recommend!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that this was not the fragrance free type. The smell is OK just not what I expected.  I will read more carefully next time.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Body Oil is an excellent, long lasting formula that both facilitates healing (of dry skin) and promotes skin enhancement (improvement in complexion). This bottle lasts much longer than one thinks as one only needs to use a small squirt of this for application to a small to medium region. It glides over the skin easily and is absorbed comfortable. One negative is that the oil does take a little bit of time to absorb into your skin. This leaves you with slick hands and the treated area. This product does have a slight odor that is neither bad nor overpowering. It lacks  a preferred &amp;#34;fragrance.&amp;#34; Recommended overall</li>
    <li> I purchased some Neutrogena Sesame oil many years ago and absoultely loved it!!! After I showered I would spray some on my wet body and then air dry. No only did it keep my skin from drying out, it also smelled great.&lt;br /&gt;Recentlly, I purchased more after all these years and plan to use it this fall and winter. The price has certainly has gone up since I bought it years ago...... but it is well worth it. This bottle will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, especially during winter weather.</li>
    <li> I love this body oil and use it daily.  It&#x27;s just as good if not better than the other name brand oils on the market today.</li>
    <li> Best product ever.  I&#x27;ve been using this after my bath/shower for years.  So much better than lotion.  Fast, soaks right into your skin, easy.  Love the feel and the scent.</li>
    <li> A few years ago I started getting itchy rashes on my arms that drove me crazy.  Cortizone cream helped, but then I started getting very itchy spots on my legs, back, etc.  I used to have oily skin, and whenever I&#x27;d see anything that said &amp;#34;body oil&amp;#34; I couldn&#x27;t believe people actually put that &amp;#34;greasy stuff&amp;#34; on their skin.  I finally tried Neutrogena Body Oil and I put it on right after my shower .  If your skin is still quite damp it dries even more quickly.  The point is, it worked for me, and my skin doesn&#x27;t look greasy at all.  It smells good, and I don&#x27;t have the rashes any longer.</li>
    <li> This is the best oil ever.  It&#x27;s great to use after getting out of the shower or the bath.  The mild aroma is pleasant especially for those who have allergies to strong odors.  The price is comparable to that big box store but free shipping through Amazon Prime is the best!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love for my extra dry skin!</li>
    <li> I love this product It smells so good and makes your skin feel so soft. I would definitely purchase this product again and again.</li>
    <li> THE BEST ! HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT ALL MY LIFE !!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and was happy to find it on Amazon.  It&#x27;s light yet effective with just a hint of sesame.  It&#x27;s a perfect moisturizer after bathing or anytime and never greasy or staining.  It&#x27;s also a great make up remover. I will never be without it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s light and silky with just a faint fragrance.  Makes my skin feel soft w/o being oily.</li>
    <li> great product! Not too greasy and has a nice scent. I use this after I shower and it moisturizers really well</li>
    <li> I have used Neutrogena body oil for years and it works wonders on my skin!  I put it on after every shower and I get compliments on how soft my skin is all the time!  Great product and can&#x27;t beat it for the price!</li>
    <li> Very great oil right after bath</li>
    <li> great light moisturize oil , perfect for after shower dries fast and does not stain your clothes and it has a very delicate perfume.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at Amazon for my wife after our local drug store quick carrying it.  She likes it better than the heavier weight sesame oils available at Whole Foods and other places locally.  We are very happy that it is still available at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Perfect Xmas surprise.</li>
    <li> Though the name and the description stated &amp;#34;light&amp;#34;, I guess I didn&#x27;t know what &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; meant. It is so light that it&#x27;s almost non-existent. I want a LITTLE of oil&#x27;s properties. I still have to slather on body cream.  Maybe it will be better in the summer.</li>
    <li> I use this to massage my GF after showers.  Its great because a little bit goes a long way and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  And feels nice on my hands afterwords.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin moist without oily feeling.  The light sesame scent smells so fresh.  I love this product!</li>
