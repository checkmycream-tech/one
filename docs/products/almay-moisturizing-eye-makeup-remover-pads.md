      <li>I wash my face with olive oil soap and warm water afterwards, so getting rid of the oil is no problem for me.</li>
      <li>The absolute best eyemakup remover pads ever.  </li>
      <li>It kind of removes the convenience of them being a rinse-free eye makeup remover, when you have to wash off the residue.</li>
      <li>Almay pads are by far the best.</li>
      <li>I LOVE it :)</li>
      <li>Very convenient, allergy safe, and great for travel.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several eye makeup removers, and I must say that Almay Moisturizing Eye Makeup Remover Pads are the best.    </li>
      <li>Love, love love this product.</li>
      <li>I buy this product all the time, mostly from Target, but decided to look online</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure it wasn&#x27;t supposed to be like that.</li>
      <li>Wished there had been more in the jar for the price.</li>
      <li>I love it and know soon I won&#x27;t be able to find it anywhere.</li>
      <li>Anything more</li>
      <li>Almay make-up remover towelette like  wipes are much better than these Almay pads.  </li>
      <li>I love the moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>Like it better than the non oily.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I love the oil free version of this, and I picked up the moisturizing kind by accident.</li>
      <li>The oil free version is much better.</li>
      <li>I easily get rashes from perfumes and the like.  </li>
      <li>Takes off mascara easily.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s probably why they remove that waterproof mascara so easily.  </li>
      <li>It makes it so easy remove make  up and also moisturizes the skin around your eye.</li>
      <li>However, if you don&#x27;t want oil to seep into your eyes it is best to use it first and wash your face after making sure to carefully rinse the eye area.  </li>
      <li>Keeps eyelids moisturized and ready for more makeup!</li>
      <li>all you wear is light eyeliner pencil and mascara</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and does not irritate the eye and pull the skin and eyelashes.  </li>
      <li>(Don&#x27;t get the oil free</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also fragrance free and</li>
      <li>people complain that the pads are too oily, and that&#x27;s exactly why I buy those for years!!</li>
      <li>Regardless of the time of year, I use a very mild cleanser and a washcloth after using these pads and it takes off the oil, leaving my skin mildly moisturized.  </li>
      <li>The small jar with the screw on/off lid is made excellent for travel.  </li>
      <li>No rashes and area feels clean and moisturized after use.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many different eye make-up removers for years, branded, unbranded, and this one is just perfect!!    </li>
      <li>Most oil-free makeup removing pads and wipes that I have used don&#x27;t work very well by themselves when it comes to moderate-heavy eye makeup or you have to basically scrub your eyes with them!&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;After that I use a good skin cleanser and my skin is back to the drawing board and looking great.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Super bummed about this product.</li>
      <li>I use mine in the shower every night, and am always sure to gently wipe around my eye area with a warm wet washclosh after I use the wipes, so perhaps this keeps my eyes from getting that fogging effect.    </li>
      <li>area around your eyes is very gentle so the benefit of using these is tremendous since they basically do all the work without any rubbing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>you naturally have really oily skin that requires you to use other oil-free skin products, this product might not be the best bet for you.  </li>
      <li>1.It runs out pretty quickly    </li>
      <li>They also do leave a pretty oily residue but nothing a quick wipe with a washcloth can&#x27;t take care of.</li>
      <li>But the first ingredient listed is \\&quot;mineral oil\\&quot;, so which is it?</li>
      <li>They are pretty oily but 1 pad removes all my eye make up on both eyes</li>
      <li>My eyes felt blurry after the first use</li>
      <li>I have to use a paper towel to soak up the oil first before I put these on my eyes</li>
      <li>I only got them because I love Almay make-up towellete like wipes.  </li>
      <li>Mineral Oil is the first ingredient listed.  </li>
      <li>It was very old product and nowhere near as good as the current product.</li>
      <li>I wonder if this can be safe for my eyes long term.</li>
      <li>even stubborn eyeliner pretty much feels like baby oil on a wipe</li>
      <li>First of all it took over three weeks to arrive, which is unusual for something coming from Amazon.</li>
      <li>But super oily and the pads arnt as soft as they should be for the eye area.</li>
      <li>I do add a couple of drops of water on the pad and it works just fine, staying moist enough to do both eyes.</li>
      <li>This hard to find product works better than the oil free version for me.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizer.</li>
      <li>These pads irritated my eyes because they are scratchy and they have soooooo much oil on them.  </li>
      <li>Not the real thing!&lt;br</li>
      <li>So much so that I have to take a piece of tissue to absorb the residue on my eyes.</li>
      <li>and I think the oil is actually helping because my eyes have been looking a lot more alive (as opposed to zombie eyes, haha)</li>
      <li>I tried them for about three days and then just gave up and threw the rest of them away because my whole face was oilier than it had ever been before.</li>
      <li>Cleans eye makeup off very well</li>
      <li>Too much residue remains and then I can&#x27;t see to read.</li>
      <li>I have found Almay to be more gentle than other brands you find in the supermarket.  </li>
      <li>They get the job done better than any other pad.  </li>
      <li>I figured I&#x27;d try this one since I love the other Almay Oil-Free makeup remover pads and this one was cheaper</li>
      <li>I thought this product would be better than other eye removers i have tried but not so.</li>
      <li>I am okay with this purchase, but I do plan to look for something different next time.</li>
      <li>But otherwise, I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen reviews stating that it doesn&#x27;t but unless these people are wearing concrete on their lashes, this will do the trick.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fast and gets even waterproof mascara off quickly &amp; completely.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear loads of make-up or eyeliner or anything though so for heavy make-up users, I would think you&#x27;d have to use more to get it all off.</li>
      <li>Simply, it removes all of your makeup smoothly, simply, and without having to tug at your skin, something you&#x27;re more sensitive to as you age.  </li>
      <li>I normally use the oil-free version of this product</li>
      <li>I live in NYC and Duane Reade and CVS do not sell these anymore.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s new,</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know this for a fact, but I honestly think that the aloe, cucumber, and green tea are actually helping to keep away and diminsh wrinkles around my eye area.  </li>
      <li>These remove all my makeup without an issue - I do wish they were slightly bigger however as it seems as I think I could use a little more space.</li>
      <li>Removes ALL eye makeup, completely.  </li>
      <li>But this seller sent me stock that appeared to be about 5 years old.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s keeps skin  soft and moist around my eyes.</li>
      <li>I am surprised no one else has commented about this.</li>
      <li>I have normal to oily skin in the summer, and normal to dry in the winter.  </li>
      <li>so I normally have generic oil-free makeup remover wipes to get rid of the remainder.</li>
      <li>I normally use Mary Kay mascara and it only takes 1 pad to do each eye.</li>
      <li>I normally use a different version of the product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Yes, as other users have mentioned they feel very oily.  </li>
      <li>It was very greasy and the pads were very rough.  </li>
      <li>After I wipe off my make-up, I just take a couple sheets of toilet paper and wipe/blot the excess away, leaving my skin feeling just soft and not greasy.</li>
      <li>I have very dry skin and couldn&#x27;t use these, but I have really sensitive skin.  </li>

<li> I have very dry skin and couldn&#x27;t use these, but I have really sensitive skin.  </li>
<li> I assumed it would be fine since I love the other ones so much, but it leaves a disgusting film of grease all over your eyes and in your lashes that you have to wash off.</li>
<li> Only thing ,u have to use a dry cloth or tissue to remove excess moisture.</li>
<li> My face is not oily not that dry either.</li>
<li> I wanted the oil for my old, dry skin but a little less would be preferable.</li>
<li> When I opened it the pads were rough and dry but still somehow soaked with oil.</li>
<li> It definitely does take your eye makeup off of your eyes, but it also leaves them a little oiled up.</li>
<li> The formula is extremely gentle and it does its job without irritating the eyes.</li>
<li> You could just use round cotton pads with mineral oil and would have the same thing.</li>
<li> I am really no a fan of these pads.  </li>
<li> I like the product because it removes eye makeup with far less work or accidental tugging on the delicate eye area.  </li>
<li> I use one side of the pad for one eye, turn it over and do the other eye.</li>
<li> They remove my makeup extremely well without drying my skin.</li>
<li> After removing my eye makeup with it there was an oil slick under my eyes that was still there when I woke up the next morning.</li>
<li> Under my eyes I get dark circles sometimes</li>
<li> Containers from Amazon are dry and have very little liquid to remove makeup.</li>
<li> The oil-free one, on the other hand, irritated my eyes to no end!</li>
<li> You will use less pads with this eyemakeup remover pad than others.</li>
<li> my face not clean, I have to tissue it off.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little bit messy.</li>
<li> I wear eyeliner, shadow, and mascara everyday and this leaves no trace at all.  </li>
<li> I have used these pads for a few years every night.</li>
<li> But I recommend to my daughter, she tried and didn&#x27;t like it, too messy.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll admit I wear somewhat heavy makeup; cream eyeliner, waterproof mascara, etc.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s way too oily and the pads are stiff.</li>
<li> And the small amount of oil works well with my eye moisturizer.</li>
<li> I read reviews where people complained of the &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; moisturizing part of the product</li>
<li> lately.</li>
<li> I used two or three trying to give it a chance, but it is definitely not a good product.</li>
<li> Yes it removes makeup well, and moisturizes, but I&#x27;m so disgusted by the grease that it&#x27;s not even worth it.</li>
<li> it removes liner, mascara without irritating your eyelids  </li>
<li> Came with the seal broken won&#x27;t use It&lt;br</li>
<li> The thin pads are oily which I prefer because of the dryness of my skin.</li>
<li> This one leaves a residue behind and it didn&#x27;t get rid of all my mascara.  </li>
<li> They are extremely thin and greasy; however, they do work.  </li>
<li> , that is false advertising and should not be tolerated.  </li>
<li> They have caused me to contract a painful condition called blepharitis due to being so oily in residue.</li>
<li> And it gets in my eyes and makes me unable to focus for 30 minutes.</li>
<li> Has a faint smell of mineral oil.</li>
<li> This product can be difficult to find, for reasons I don&#x27;t understand.  </li>
<li> I have tried a lot of eye makeup removers including some really expensive ones.</li>
<li> Horrible... Unusable all dried out..</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s still that bad.   </li>
<li> Highly disappointed.</li>
<li> This has a mineral-oil base so perhaps this helps too?    </li>
<li> The oil-free one was terrible.  </li>
<li> One word: Horrible!  </li>
<li> and they are DISGUSTING.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> But the first ingredient listed is \\&quot;mineral oil\\&quot;, so which is it? Oil-free or not?  I like the stuff, though. The mineral oil cuts through everything without dislodging any eyelashes. I wash my face with olive oil soap and warm water afterwards, so getting rid of the oil is no problem for me.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different eye make-up removers for years, branded, unbranded, and this one is just perfect!!    Here are the pros and cons for this product:  Pros  1.Perfect for travelers!! You will have no problem for security check!!  2.You don&#x27;t need to spend extra money on cotton pad  3.Easy application - it removes liner, mascara without irritating your eyelids  4.It doesn&#x27;t give you dryness after you use this product     Cons  1.It runs out pretty quickly    I LOVE it :)</li>
    <li> Have used these for years.  Very convenient, allergy safe, and great for travel.</li>
    <li> It worked to get make up off, but left me feeling like I rubbed a bottle of vegetable oil all over my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several eye makeup removers, and I must say that Almay Moisturizing Eye Makeup Remover Pads are the best.    Pros:  1.) Travels great!  The small jar with the screw on/off lid is made excellent for travel.  Since the pads come \\&quot;pre-soaked\\&quot; in the makeup remover liquid, there is no need to carry around cotton balls or tissues when you&#x27;re on the go.  Also great to keep in the shower!    2.) Removes ALL eye makeup, completely.  I&#x27;ve seen reviews stating that it doesn&#x27;t but unless these people are wearing concrete on their lashes, this will do the trick.  I wear eyeliner, shadow, and mascara everyday and this leaves no trace at all.  This also removes waterproof mascara as well as long-lasting lip color.  Also... some eye makeup removers leave a makeup \\&quot;residue\\&quot; around the eye area; this doesn&#x27;t.    3.) Moisturizes... I don&#x27;t know this for a fact, but I honestly think that the aloe, cucumber, and green tea are actually helping to keep away and diminsh wrinkles around my eye area.  This has a mineral-oil base so perhaps this helps too?    4.)  Some people state that the oil-based eye makeup removers \\&quot;fog\\&quot; their eyes, but I have not had an issue with this.  I use mine in the shower every night, and am always sure to gently wipe around my eye area with a warm wet washclosh after I use the wipes, so perhaps this keeps my eyes from getting that fogging effect.    5.) There are 80 pads in each container, which last me well over two months.  For the price, you just can&#x27;t beat that.    6.) Rated \\&quot;Best of Beauty\\&quot; by Allure magazine.    Cons:  NONE.    Note:  Almay has a non-oily version, which I have never used because I&#x27;ve had no luck with eye makeup removers that do not have an oil-base.</li>
    <li> Just what I always use</li>
    <li> I have used both the moisturizing and the oil-free version of this makeup remover. Now, I will only rebuy the moisturizing one. The oil-free one was terrible.  I can deal with having a bit of oil around my eyes after removing makeup, especially if it is moisturizing the area like it says it does. I end up going to sleep anyway after removing makeup, so it isn&#x27;t a big deal. The formula is extremely gentle and it does its job without irritating the eyes. And if you don&#x27;t want the oil around your eyes after removing the makeup, just take a towel and wipe it off. It is not a big deal.  The oil-free one, on the other hand, irritated my eyes to no end! I couldn&#x27;t even finish the container. My eyes became really red and bloodshot and I just couldn&#x27;t keep using them. I am going to throw these out and re-buy the moisturizing ones.</li>
    <li> It definitely does take your eye makeup off of your eyes, but it also leaves them a little oiled up. To greasy of a product to use in the morning if you are rushing to work and make an eyeliner mistake. Should only be used at night when you have plenty of time to wash your face thro-ly.</li>
    <li> Yuck. Oily. And it gets in my eyes and makes me unable to focus for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> Leaves eyes oily - made me itchy.</li>
    <li> The absolute best eyemakup remover pads ever.  They get the job done better than any other pad.  You will use less pads with this eyemakeup remover pad than others.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizer. My face is not oily not that dry either. Only thing ,u have to use a dry cloth or tissue to remove excess moisture. But that&#x27;s only if you were trying to reapply makeup.</li>
    <li> This hard to find product works better than the oil free version for me.  However, if you don&#x27;t want oil to seep into your eyes it is best to use it first and wash your face after making sure to carefully rinse the eye area.  I like the product because it removes eye makeup with far less work or accidental tugging on the delicate eye area.  And the small amount of oil works well with my eye moisturizer.</li>
    <li> this is a good remover..but the pads are sorta rough...could be softer...but it&#x27;s durable...efficient when remove makeup..i would try oil-free next time...</li>
    <li> Horrible... Unusable all dried out..</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product.  I have found Almay to be more gentle than other brands you find in the supermarket.  I easily get rashes from perfumes and the like.  No rashes and area feels clean and moisturized after use.  Removes even waterproof mascara and the all day lipstick/lipstain.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> Super bummed about this product. Read reviews thought it wouldn&#x27;t be oily. But super oily and the pads arnt as soft as they should be for the eye area. Going in the trash.</li>
    <li> I live in NYC and Duane Reade and CVS do not sell these anymore. I have friends who tried these and say that they are too greasy. But, I like the extra oil to run into my eye area. I&#x27;ve been using these for years, and am so happy I found them here at Amazon!</li>
    <li> Came with the seal broken won&#x27;t use It&lt;br /&gt; seal was tone</li>
    <li> I always use this. It&#x27;s fast and gets even waterproof mascara off quickly &amp; completely. I use one side of the pad for one eye, turn it over and do the other eye. I do add a couple of drops of water on the pad and it works just fine, staying moist enough to do both eyes.</li>
    <li> I cant even use these, they are so saturated i cant even use them. I now have to use a cotton ball along with these pads.</li>
    <li> You could just use round cotton pads with mineral oil and would have the same thing. It does the job but is not necessary. Has a faint smell of mineral oil.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and couldn&#x27;t use these, but I have really sensitive skin.  I just cannot take off my makeup before bed or my eyes get a rash.</li>
    <li> Love, love love this product. Removes makeup as promised. Keeps eyelids moisturized and ready for more makeup! I like it and will continue buying it</li>
    <li> I have given rave reviews on this product. The item pictured is a great product. But this seller sent me stock that appeared to be about 5 years old. It was very old product and nowhere near as good as the current product. It was very greasy and the pads were very rough.  I buy this product all the time, mostly from Target, but decided to look online, I love amazon!  But hey, if sellers show a picture of one product then sell you another, that is false advertising and should not be tolerated.  I just threw it in the garbage.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little bit messy. I like it.i don&#x27;t have to use night eye cream. It&#x27;s keeps skin  soft and moist around my eyes. I have used these pads for a few years every night. Now I bought it for my mother and she likes it also. But I recommend to my daughter, she tried and didn&#x27;t like it, too messy. She uses mascara I don&#x27;t. So you don&#x27;t know until you try</li>
    <li> Works great when bought from store. Containers from Amazon are dry and have very little liquid to remove makeup.</li>
    <li> I order 15 or 20 at a time. perfect for removing all kinds of makeup and leaves my eyes clean and shiny.</li>
    <li> It was like rubbing baby oil on my face and I&#x27;m sure it wasn&#x27;t supposed to be like that. Maybe next time I wont buy things like this from Amazon</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s SO oily. Enough that it leaves my fingers feeling all greasy afterwards. It does, otoh, remove my amateur-applied eye makeup.</li>
    <li> These are the best eye make up remover pads I&#x27;ve ever tried. They are pretty oily but 1 pad removes all my eye make up on both eyes so this container will last awhile.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after all of the great reviews but didn&#x27;t expect it to be this oily! My eyes felt blurry after the first use so I doubt I will ever use it again.</li>
    <li> This product can be difficult to find, for reasons I don&#x27;t understand.  The thin pads are oily which I prefer because of the dryness of my skin. They remove my makeup extremely well without drying my skin. This product works for me!</li>
    <li> I figured I&#x27;d try this one since I love the other Almay Oil-Free makeup remover pads and this one was cheaper and it&#x27;s new, but I don&#x27;t like it.  Wish I would&#x27;ve stuck to my oil-free one.  This one leaves a residue behind and it didn&#x27;t get rid of all my mascara.  Have to wash hands afterwards also cause have it all over my hands also.  Wont buy this one again.  Next time I&#x27;ll stick with the oil-free pads also from Almay.</li>
    <li> These do the job. Wished there had been more in the jar for the price.</li>
    <li> I for the life of me can&#x27;t figure out why Almay discontinued this product. I love it and know soon I won&#x27;t be able to find it anywhere.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit I wear somewhat heavy makeup; cream eyeliner, waterproof mascara, etc. This works perfectly when I need to remove all of my makeup for the day.&lt;br /&gt;I can use one side of a pad for both of my eyes so these pads last me a loooong time. I have been using these for years.&lt;br /&gt;They DO leave an oily residue so I normally have generic oil-free makeup remover wipes to get rid of the remainder. Most oil-free makeup removing pads and wipes that I have used don&#x27;t work very well by themselves when it comes to moderate-heavy eye makeup or you have to basically scrub your eyes with them!&lt;br /&gt;The area around your eyes is very gentle so the benefit of using these is tremendous since they basically do all the work without any rubbing.&lt;br /&gt;After that I use a good skin cleanser and my skin is back to the drawing board and looking great.&lt;br /&gt;If all you wear is light eyeliner pencil and mascara you might not need this. Anything more and they work wonders!</li>
    <li> Almay make-up remover towelette like  wipes are much better than these Almay pads.  These pads irritated my eyes because they are scratchy and they have soooooo much oil on them.  One word: Horrible!  I have to use a paper towel to soak up the oil first before I put these on my eyes and it&#x27;s still that bad.   I only got them because I love Almay make-up towellete like wipes.  Boy was that a big mistake.  Stay-away from these pads.</li>
    <li> These remove all my makeup without an issue - I do wish they were slightly bigger however as it seems as I think I could use a little more space. They also do leave a pretty oily residue but nothing a quick wipe with a washcloth can&#x27;t take care of.</li>
    <li> This makes my eye lids stick together. I wonder if this can be safe for my eyes long term. The oil free version is much better. I ordered this by mistake. Highly disappointed.</li>
    <li> Bought these at target. Do NOT recommend. They have caused me to contract a painful condition called blepharitis due to being so oily in residue.</li>
    <li> It did not work well to remove makeup and left my skin feeling oily. WAY too oily. I used two or three trying to give it a chance, but it is definitely not a good product. I ended up throwing away the rest.</li>
    <li> I love the moisturizing.  It goes on smoothly and does not irritate the eye and pull the skin and eyelashes.  Very effective.</li>
    <li> This product makes my eyes foggy after using it. Yes it travels great etc. but I can&#x27;t quite see after I use it.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of eye makeup removers including some really expensive ones. Almay pads are by far the best. They are a bit oily but they are supposed to be in order to protect the skin around your eye. (Don&#x27;t get the oil free they don&#x27;t work) There are 80 pads in the container but I use one pad 3 or for times so they last forever.</li>
    <li> Not the real thing!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always bought it at the store, and this is not the same. It&#x27;s way too oily and the pads are stiff. Would never buy it again.</li>
    <li> Too liquids and leaves  my face not clean, I have to tissue it off.</li>
    <li> I am really no a fan of these pads.  They take off the makeup well, but leave a lot of product on your eyes.  So much so that I have to take a piece of tissue to absorb the residue on my eyes.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of conflicting reviews on this product but decided to take a leap of faith and try it. For me, the stuff works great. I normally use Mary Kay mascara and it only takes 1 pad to do each eye. I don&#x27;t wear loads of make-up or eyeliner or anything though so for heavy make-up users, I would think you&#x27;d have to use more to get it all off. I read reviews where people complained of the &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; moisturizing part of the product but I actually like it. Under my eyes I get dark circles sometimes and I think the oil is actually helping because my eyes have been looking a lot more alive (as opposed to zombie eyes, haha) lately. I think the issue people had was that they left ALL the oil on their eyes after wiping their eyes with the pads. After I wipe off my make-up, I just take a couple sheets of toilet paper and wipe/blot the excess away, leaving my skin feeling just soft and not greasy. It reminds me of removing make up with baby oil. Hope that helps!</li>
    <li> They are extremely thin and greasy; however, they do work.  I am okay with this purchase, but I do plan to look for something different next time.</li>
    <li> Takes off mascara easily. Does not irritate eyes. Like it better than the non oily. Could no longer find in stores.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Simply, it removes all of your makeup smoothly, simply, and without having to tug at your skin, something you&#x27;re more sensitive to as you age.  It&#x27;s also fragrance free and hypoallergenic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, as other users have mentioned they feel very oily.  Mineral Oil is the first ingredient listed.  That&#x27;s probably why they remove that waterproof mascara so easily.  I&#x27;ve found a way to use that oiliness to my benefit.  I have normal to oily skin in the summer, and normal to dry in the winter.  Regardless of the time of year, I use a very mild cleanser and a washcloth after using these pads and it takes off the oil, leaving my skin mildly moisturized.  And as final bonus, I no longer have makeup stains on my washcloths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you naturally have really oily skin that requires you to use other oil-free skin products, this product might not be the best bet for you.  But otherwise, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> way way to oily  but does remove makeup even stubborn eyeliner pretty much feels like baby oil on a wipe</li>
    <li> I normally use a different version of the product. The purple one which I am thinking is oil-free or something because I bought these at the store since it was all there was and they are DISGUSTING. I am surprised no one else has commented about this. It makes everything all oily. It removes the makeup great but makes me want to vom with all the oil on my fingers and face. Do you like to rub oil on your eyes? Bleh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to see if CVS will take it back!</li>
    <li> Best eye make-up remover I have found!</li>
    <li> I normally use the oil-free version of this product but I decided to give this one a try.  First of all it took over three weeks to arrive, which is unusual for something coming from Amazon. When I opened it the pads were rough and dry but still somehow soaked with oil. After removing my eye makeup with it there was an oil slick under my eyes that was still there when I woke up the next morning. Over the course of the day my mascara transferred under my eyes until I looked like a raccoon because my skin was so oily, which has never happened before. I tried them for about three days and then just gave up and threw the rest of them away because my whole face was oilier than it had ever been before. Just stick with the oil-free ones.</li>
    <li> I have used these for years.  They work well.  The oil-free ones do not!</li>
    <li> people complain that the pads are too oily, and that&#x27;s exactly why I buy those for years!! It makes it so easy remove make  up and also moisturizes the skin around your eye. Tried multiple product but always come back to these pads!!</li>
    <li> Cleans eye makeup off very well but it is a bit too oily. Too much residue remains and then I can&#x27;t see to read. I wanted the oil for my old, dry skin but a little less would be preferable.</li>
    <li> I thought this product would be better than other eye removers i have tried but not so.</li>
    <li> I love the oil free version of this, and I picked up the moisturizing kind by accident. I assumed it would be fine since I love the other ones so much, but it leaves a disgusting film of grease all over your eyes and in your lashes that you have to wash off. It kind of removes the convenience of them being a rinse-free eye makeup remover, when you have to wash off the residue. Yes it removes makeup well, and moisturizes, but I&#x27;m so disgusted by the grease that it&#x27;s not even worth it.</li>
