      <li>okay.  </li>

      <li>The Lavender is my favorite</li>
      <li>I love the creamy lather and the scent, it&#x27;s one of my favorite body wash.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
      <li>For the price, there are better washes.</li>
      <li>Okay, I&#x27;m kidding about my eyeballs.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d better give it a good go, since I bought so much of it!</li>
      <li>overall I&#x27;ve been really happy with this body wash :-)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use in the shower and never had a problem with clogging.  </li>
      <li>I am in my 8th week of pregnancy, so sometimes it seems strong, but up until now, the smell has been fine.</li>

      <li>Light and foams well.</li>
      <li>It is gentle on hands and has a really nice yet not overpowering scent of lavender.</li>
      <li>Jason&#x27;s natural products are exceptional.</li>
      <li>thing I like best is the lavender smell - distinctive but not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>Lathers well and my skin feels clean.  </li>
      <li>It makes you feel clean without drying, yet doesn&#x27;t make you feel over-moisturized or coated in something like super-moisturizing washes do.</li>
      <li>The fragrance does not smell like true lavender, but still smells</li>
      <li>I love tea tree almost as much as lavender.</li>
      <li>My search for organic health products that are actually good to human skin continues.</li>
      <li>It lasts 1 full year for her.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed a particularly strong deodorizing power like the description says (as in I&#x27;m still using deodorant under my arms, not that the soap doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling</li>
      <li>the added multitude of different ingredients from sodium chloride and sodium sulfate to sodium lauryl Sulfo-acetates (a whole lot of sodium--not surprising to read reviews of drying out skin)</li>
      <li>I love that it is organic and has a natural lavender smell.</li>
      <li>the original first ingredient of Purified Water has been replaced with just Water as its first ingredient, tsk, tsk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among</li>
      <li>I was in a very earth-friendly grocery store and needed something quick.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not exaggerating; the sneezing fits are really quite extraordinary.</li>
      <li>I have the containers of the original product and this new product side-by-side for comparison, and even though the new label says \\&quot;New Look, Same Great Formula,\\&quot;</li>
      <li>- it makes sure I use just the right amount (as others have said, it lathers well, even enough for shaving my legs).</li>
      <li>The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I feel it could be a tad more moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>When I first got this (before surgery)</li>
      <li>One of my favorite essential oils to use is Lavender.</li>
      <li>The labels as shown here on this site are more than a bit misleading as they no longer apply to the actual product you will receive.</li>
      <li>that is blatantly NOT</li>
      <li>Jason&#x27;s body washes are known for no or low sulfides which is good for sensitive skins and the main reason I purchase.  </li>
      <li>I discovered this product purely by accident.</li>
      <li>I find it very relaxing.</li>
      <li>I really did.</li>
      <li>Also, fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Would it not be for the price (too high!)</li>
      <li>scent is absolutely amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, I definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for  more natural skin products.</li>
      <li>reading the list of ingredients, I was further surprised to find that ALL FOUR ORIGINAL certified organic ingredients, Aloe Vera GEL, LAVENDER, CHAMOMILE, and MARIGOLD have been removed!</li>
      <li>Having been a long-time user of the original JASON PURE, NATURAL &amp; ORGANIC Satin Shower Body Wash, I was very surprised when I pulled a bottle from my new order that has a new label that no longer states that it IS organic.  </li>
      <li>Love the smell, especially after a long hot shower.  </li>

      <li>Safe for my twins previous skin</li>
      <li>I love the body wash and this product tends to be more expensive in stores</li>
      <li>, I also noticed that (of course) the smell is different as well; no longer truly soothing, now more of a generic shampoo smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>High quality.</li>
      <li>A couple of pumps does the job rather well, though I&#x27;m petite, so you may need a few more.</li>
      <li>called the 800 number and was informed that the 59-year-old company has gone through changes, including new labels and \\&quot;product re-formulation.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>The price was right, and I thought the product would be natural enough for me.</li>
      <li>Now, let&#x27;s be clear: I AM mildly sensitive to chemicals and perfumes, but I can&#x27;t recall ever sneezing uncontrollably to anything NATURAL.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, when I&#x27;m done with this, I shall steer clear of the body wash of doom.</li>
      <li>It also hasn&#x27;t caused any skin irritation, which is a miracle for me, considering my reaction to the scent, and sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I use essential oils all the time (which have strong scents, though natural), as well as heavily scented natural products.</li>
      <li>Apparently not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately upon opening the box, I could smell the perfume.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I discovered this product purely by accident. I was in a very earth-friendly grocery store and needed something quick. This product seemed to be the least intimidating option so I brought it home and fell in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing I like best is the lavender smell - distinctive but not overwhelming. I find it very relaxing. I haven&#x27;t really noticed a particularly strong deodorizing power like the description says (as in I&#x27;m still using deodorant under my arms, not that the soap doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling fresh).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the pump bottle - it makes sure I use just the right amount (as others have said, it lathers well, even enough for shaving my legs). This stuff seems to last forever in my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside--and I&#x27;m not alone in this thought because others who&#x27;ve used it have said the same--is that it&#x27;s a little weird to use a product named after a man (and I have lots of friends named Jason) that looks a little bit like... well, to keep it tasteful, let&#x27;s just say a little bit like a reason you might need to take a shower. Or snot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall I&#x27;ve been really happy with this body wash :-)</li>
    <li> Been using this body wash for over a decade, glad to be able to get it delivered.</li>
    <li> The consistency makes this is a great body wash. I even use it to shave my legs!!  The fragrance does not smell like true lavender, but still smells okay.  I will order it again!</li>
    <li> Lathers well but smells awful.  I&#x27;ll stick to the tea-tree scent.</li>
    <li> I like jason products because they are free of nasty stuff, and there is a large amount within this bottle.</li>
    <li> The lavender body wash smells so good and lathers up so rich that I call it my \\&quot;affordable luxury\\&quot;.  I truly feel pampered each time I use it. The bottle is big and lasts a long time.  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I feel it could be a tad more moisturizing.  It&#x27;s not drying by any means, but I don&#x27;t feel like I can skip my post-bath lotion application either.</li>
    <li> Other soaps and body washes make my skin dry, but not Jason&#x27;s. been using it for years and still love it.</li>
    <li> Jason&#x27;s natural products are exceptional. I love the body wash and this product tends to be more expensive in stores so that&#x27;s why I purchase on amazon. If you like the smell of  lavender, this product  will tickle your fancy.  Very nice during shower time.  The soap feels great on your skin and nourishes because it contians Vitamin E, Pro-Vitamin B5 and aloe vera. Jason&#x27;s body washes are known for no or low sulfides which is good for sensitive skins and the main reason I purchase.  I think what I love the most about this product is the bottle dispenser.  It&#x27;s so easy to use in the shower and never had a problem with clogging.  It despenses down to the bottom of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a prime product which is a plus too.  Multiple purchase customer and I&#x27;ll be back again.</li>
    <li> I love Jason&#x27;s soaps.  It&#x27;s great on my skin and the size of the bottle is worth the price.  Definitely will purchase it on-line again for the price alone.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 20 years, maybe more. I&#x27;ve tried other brands thinking I&#x27;m missing out on new products but I always come back to this.  The Lavender is my favorite but I also like the Tea Tree one too.  If they made it in coconut then I would be in heaven!</li>
    <li> I love the creamy lather and the scent, it&#x27;s one of my favorite body wash. I use this everyday. I have been using this body wash for 4 years .</li>
    <li> I like the body wash.</li>
    <li> This product smells amazing and the the lather is so luxurious, I definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for  more natural skin products.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just ok. For the price, there are better washes.</li>
    <li> Needed a less expensive, yet still high quality ingredients comparable to California baby brand. This is a great option! Smells great! Safe for my twins previous skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle of this stuff.  Love the smell, especially after a long hot shower.  Lathers well and my skin feels clean.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Lathers luxuriously with a light scent. My skin always feels so good after a bath that I just have to share. Get some!</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this body wash. I really did. The price was right, and I thought the product would be natural enough for me. Apparently not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately upon opening the box, I could smell the perfume. The bottles weren&#x27;t leaking at all, either. So, very strong scent. Now, let&#x27;s be clear: I AM mildly sensitive to chemicals and perfumes, but I can&#x27;t recall ever sneezing uncontrollably to anything NATURAL. I use essential oils all the time (which have strong scents, though natural), as well as heavily scented natural products. Never a problem there. This made me sneeze like crazy when I used it. That&#x27;s not a desirable effect in a shower, with hard surfaces to knock one&#x27;s head on when you&#x27;re flailing like, well, a person who is sneezing like crazy. It&#x27;s especially not good for someone who recently had hip surgery (no, people, I&#x27;m actually only 27) because sneezing can make you nearly fall over in a slippery shower, especially when you&#x27;re already unsteady. When I first got this (before surgery) it was still making me sneeze a week later. I thought *Hmm, that might fade. I might get acclimated to it. I&#x27;d better give it a good go, since I bought so much of it!* I bought this in November. It is now April. I have NOT acclimated to it. Still sneezing, and it&#x27;s from this product. I know because I&#x27;ve made brief switches to other products (Burt&#x27;s Bees, African Black bar soaps, castile soap) and haven&#x27;t sneezed. Then I use this again. I shower, sneeze my brains out, hope I don&#x27;t crack my head or fall, almost do, and kick myself for buying this. I&#x27;m not exaggerating; the sneezing fits are really quite extraordinary. I leave the door unlocked so my husband can rescue me in the event of a sneezing catastrophe. But, well... at least you know it lasts a long time!? I wish it didn&#x27;t. Why am I still using it? \\&quot;Waste not, want not\\&quot;, with a caveat: \\&quot;Hope you don&#x27;t die in the shower.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is definitely a chemical smell to this. Lavender? HA! One of my favorite essential oils to use is Lavender. This is NOT LAVENDER! It smells (to me) like a chemical re-creation of lavender. A very poor one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have its merits, however. What I can say for the wash is this: A couple of pumps does the job rather well, though I&#x27;m petite, so you may need a few more. It lathers well for a not-so-conventional, wants-to-be-\\&quot;natural\\&quot; body wash. It makes you feel clean without drying, yet doesn&#x27;t make you feel over-moisturized or coated in something like super-moisturizing washes do. It also hasn&#x27;t caused any skin irritation, which is a miracle for me, considering my reaction to the scent, and sensitive skin. The product is a good value, if your body doesn&#x27;t give you violent reactions to it. So, three stars. I&#x27;m trying to be fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the cleansing performance of this product, some (curious or self-destructive) part of me is tempted to try the tea tree. I love tea tree almost as much as lavender. But since this smells like chemical NOT-lavender, I&#x27;m afraid of what the tea tree would smell like/do. Perhaps it will make my eyeballs bleed and fall out? Okay, I&#x27;m kidding about my eyeballs. But I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again. If there is an unscented version, I might try a sample to see if it makes me react. Otherwise, when I&#x27;m done with this, I shall steer clear of the body wash of doom.</li>
    <li> This body wash is absolutely amazing!!! Light and foams well. I love this product!</li>
    <li> Having been a long-time user of the original JASON PURE, NATURAL &amp; ORGANIC Satin Shower Body Wash, I was very surprised when I pulled a bottle from my new order that has a new label that no longer states that it IS organic.  The label now simply states \\&quot;Pure Natural Body Wash\\&quot; in place of the original trademarked \\&quot;SATIN SHOWER Body Wash.\\&quot; Must be a reason for all these words being replaced...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon reading the list of ingredients, I was further surprised to find that ALL FOUR ORIGINAL certified organic ingredients, Aloe Vera GEL, LAVENDER, CHAMOMILE, and MARIGOLD have been removed! Not to worry, they have been replaced with a lone, certified organic ingredient: Aloe Vera LEAF JUICE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the original first ingredient of Purified Water has been replaced with just Water as its first ingredient, tsk, tsk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among the added multitude of different ingredients from sodium chloride and sodium sulfate to sodium lauryl Sulfo-acetates (a whole lot of sodium--not surprising to read reviews of drying out skin), I also noticed that (of course) the smell is different as well; no longer truly soothing, now more of a generic shampoo smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called the 800 number and was informed that the 59-year-old company has gone through changes, including new labels and \\&quot;product re-formulation.\\&quot; The labels as shown here on this site are more than a bit misleading as they no longer apply to the actual product you will receive. I have the containers of the original product and this new product side-by-side for comparison, and even though the new label says \\&quot;New Look, Same Great Formula,\\&quot; that is blatantly NOT TRUE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One can&#x27;t stop Progress and it marches on...arm-in-arm with Big Business...*big sigh*. My search for organic health products that are actually good to human skin continues. But hey, now you can buy Jason in Wal-mart!</li>
    <li> We actually use this body wash as hand soap. It is gentle on hands and has a really nice yet not overpowering scent of lavender. High quality. Also, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I will use this body was the rest of my life. It smells amazing and foams unlike many organic body washes.</li>
    <li> Honestly, this is a great body wash. Would it not be for the price (too high!) I&#x27;d only use this one and never switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is absolutely amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleanses with out drying too!</li>
    <li> I buy one every Xmas for my wife. It lasts 1 full year for her.</li>
    <li> I love that it is organic and has a natural lavender smell. I am in my 8th week of pregnancy, so sometimes it seems strong, but up until now, the smell has been fine.</li>
