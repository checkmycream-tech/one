      <li>Anyway, because we don&#x27;t have dental insurance now, this did a great job of making my teeth cleaner and getting rid of tartar and removing plaque.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product that we will continue to use.  </li>
      <li>So after reading great reviews on this product I wanted to try it.</li>

      <li>With this one my teeth improved healthy and no pain.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Within weeks most of the tarter was gone.&lt;br /&gt;Went</li>
      <li>Even more came off when I used a Dental Pik.</li>
      <li>I just love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Make sure you rinse BEFORE you brush.</li>
      <li>I am ordering more of this to continue this routine to see how that works.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure I know why.</li>
      <li>It works like a charm. :)</li>
      <li>Easy to use----flavor not so overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>Great product to user in between professional dental cleanings.  </li>
      <li>If you notice in the store, many mouth washes say alcohol free for that reason.</li>
      <li>Tarter that builds up between teeth is easily removed with a toothbrush and/or scraper.  </li>
      <li>Works great even after first time makes your teeth feel smooth and clean and really does wash away gunk away brushing and or mouthwash</li>
      <li>This mouthwash is fabulous.</li>
      <li>You feel your teeth clean and smooth.</li>
      <li>This product leaves your teeth clean and smooth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never been excited to feel chips breaking off of my teeth while flossing and brushing.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t care what any ADA study says, Plax has safely and effectively aided in the removal of plaque from the back of my lower teeth.</li>
      <li>I find it has worked really well over the years - my dentist remarked on how much better my teeth and gums were after I started using it.</li>
      <li>Other than that I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
      <li>Every time I use this stuff my mouth feels clean and fresh</li>
      <li>My mouth feels clean and fresh all day.  </li>
      <li>Anyway,  if you&#x27;re looking to reduce plaque and tarter buildup this will help tremendously.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s the very first time I write a review for a product in Amazon.</li>
      <li>have been using this product for a few years TASTES GREAT and loosens up plaque on teeth and in mouth.</li>
      <li>, we both realized that our teeth even felt MUCH cleaner and SMOOTH.  </li>
      <li>It is worth it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not afraid to smile anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The right size that was needed.</li>
      <li>This product really works, my teeth never looked nor felt clean.</li>
      <li>I was told that my gums were in great shape and that I  had very little plaque build-up.  </li>
      <li>This is the exact item i was looking for.</li>
      <li>When I finally made a dentist appointment I was sure my dentist would chastise me for my lack of flossing.  </li>
      <li>first one, I think.  </li>
      <li>Since it was a while since I had my teeth cleaned at the dentist, I decided to try this first</li>
      <li>This stuff seems to really work!</li>
      <li>This stuff works pretty darned well -</li>
      <li>I always rinse first for about 30 seconds to one minute</li>
      <li>I have only been able to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>The red formula appears to be stronger and works better</li>
      <li>OK, I wanted to wait a bit before writing my review as there are some reviews that claim some pretty terrific results with Plax.  </li>
      <li>I have to say that even after the first time we tried this</li>
      <li>I had tartar buildup and by using Plax regularly and using a dental type pick, I was able to remove the plaque over a period of about a month.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really mild and won&#x27;t burn or sting and gives a nice little minty taste before you brush.</li>
      <li>The first time using it I can tell me teeth are much cleaner than brushing alone.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;**PLAX really works, however, keep in mind that this is my own results, but I wanted to let you know that I had a heavy tartar buildup and this works for</li>
      <li>However, much to my surprise</li>
      <li>Who wants to put that stuff in their body??</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d much rather go to the dentist every 6 months and get a cleaning, than use this product.</li>
      <li>It really helps with plaque control</li>
      <li>I SAW REALLY GOODS RESULTS.</li>
      <li>IT WORKS FAST AND COULD SAVE YOU A LOT OF EXPENSE AT DENTIST FFICE.</li>
      <li>My husband says that it really works.  </li>
      <li>They product really freshens the breathe and protects teeth and gums from tartar build up.</li>
      <li>There are other rinse and mouthwash products out there that have safe ingredients and are very efficient.</li>
      <li>Unlike most other brands, this is a pre-rinse.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without my morning Plax!</li>
      <li>I have less plaque and better outcomes with each dental visit.</li>
      <li>and they said my teeth looked decent for not going to dentist in 7 years.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I read many reviews from multiple sources prior to ordering Plax.  </li>
      <li>After buying it I realized one of the main ingredients is alcohol, which is linked to oral cancer.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>so I bought it, but didn&#x27;t have high hopes because I am pessimistic</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>I believe the prerinse helps me to keep my teeth cleaner than normal.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a dental rinse to aid in reduction of plaque build up and prevention of new plaque forming.  </li>
      <li>After just about 10 days, I was brushing and a big clump of tartar (seemed large to me) in my bathroom sink!</li>
      <li>I usually swish for one minute or more, then brush.  </li>
      <li>I am confident that if I do an update a month from now, there will be little if any left.</li>
      <li>This may sound like a long time, but that plaque had been there for a long time</li>
      <li>haven&#x27;t seen a dentist since I was about 10 years old</li>
      <li>/&gt;After using this product for about 3 weeks, my tartar buildup is almost completely gone.</li>
      <li>Its not some amazing plaque removing liquid like some others are making it seem but little by little</li>
      <li>It works really well, as long as you follow the directions.</li>
      <li>I suffer from dry mouth because of some medications I am taking and this really helps my teeth feel cleaner.</li>
      <li>The claims that it could completely clear tartar buildup seemed bogus to me, especially since the alternative is paying $500 at the dentist to have it removed.</li>
      <li>With prolonged swishing time, your tongue tends to be sensitive, but this abates shortly.</li>
      <li>The only downside is that it is kind of expensive</li>
      <li>I started using Plax and within a week the plaque that was once smooth and hard began feeling porous and rough when my tongue rubbed against it.</li>

<li> I typically use this daily in the morning prior to brushing as directed.  </li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t used this product in about two weeks to prevent possible damage due to overuse.</li>
<li> Look forward to next dentist visit---will have less of a target problem..</li>
<li> I am still using it and much of the thick tartar is gone!</li>
<li> A few days later it started flaking off at the toothlines where I floss.</li>
<li> I expected a product that dissolves plaque/tartar would taste like turpentine and burn like hell fire, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
<li> I am not sure why you cant find this now at the local stores.</li>
<li> And I cannot see any of the other tartar from the other teeth, so</li>
<li> about 99% of products (I&#x27;ve been disappointed too many times).</li>
<li> I have to admit that I was skeptical at first about this product.</li>
<li> We brush our teeth with regular toothpaste, then we take a small amount of Plax and swish around our mouth, then we brush again with the Plax still in our mouth.  </li>
<li> and I have a lot of hard, rough tartar buildup on the back of my bottom front teeth.</li>
<li> He has to have it and it has become hard to find locally, so I looked it up on Amazon.  </li>
<li> And I&#x27;m doing it to save other people&#x27;s teeth!</li>
<li> I actually bought Plax to get rid of a very small piece of tartar in between two of my teeth.</li>
<li> /&gt;Results for me: So I followed the instructions and did the rinsing TWICE a day due to my heavy buildup of tartar.</li>
<li> I noticed a reduction of slight plaque build up between teeth within two weeks.  </li>
<li> I am about half way through this bottle of plax and can see a very slight difference.  </li>
<li> so my next cleaning would not take so long and be so painful.</li>
<li> that is all you need, a small bit of the Plax each time.</li>
<li> Hate to get my teeth cleaned because the pick hurts my gums and makes them bleed, having to leave my mouth open so long...</li>
<li> It shouldn&#x27;t be so hard to find.</li>
<li> For me, I discovered that I had rather thick tartar on my bottom front teeth and just some tartar on the rest.</li>
<li> There I said it.&lt;br /&gt;I had build up behind my lower front teeth</li>
<li> Smiling was ugly because you could see the dark brown between my bottom teeth.</li>
<li> but I didn&#x27;t want to buy a whitening kit because one in the past caused bad tooth sensitivity.</li>
<li> The sad part is that the tartar goes away</li>
<li> I also used to go to the dentist every  6-months without fail.  </li>
<li> I tried other products and the taste was terrible.  </li>
<li> Artificial colors, SLS, Saccharin?</li>
<li> I am shocked at all the 5-star reviews.</li>
<li> A nasty brown stain on each of my teeth!</li>
<li> Ingredients are absolutely horrific.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Easy to use----flavor not so overwhelming.  Very pleased with results.  Look forward to next dentist visit---will have less of a target problem..</li>
    <li> I tried to find this product but could not find it anywhere so i thought i would look here and sure it was here. This is the exact item i was looking for. I am not sure why you cant find this now at the local stores. It was sent and recieved when they said it would be. The right size that was needed.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s the very first time I write a review for a product in Amazon. And I&#x27;m doing it to save other people&#x27;s teeth! Plax? It&#x27;s great at the first 3 days you use it. You feel your teeth clean and smooth. And you actually see some of the tartar (the white stains) going away. The sad part is that the tartar goes away BUT you get freaking stains all over your teeth!!!!! Brown stains!!! I have never had stains like that! I actually bought Plax to get rid of a very small piece of tartar in between two of my teeth. And now I have stain on ALL of my teeth! All of them! A nasty brown stain on each of my teeth! I just wanna cry! Going to the dentist and hopefully save the damage.</li>
    <li> With this one my teeth improved healthy and no pain.&lt;br /&gt;So far this is the best product and going to use it.</li>
    <li> Pretreatment that helps loosen plaque before you brush. It is a simple step but it helps with my dental cleanings. I have less plaque and better outcomes with each dental visit. Yay!!!! It may seem small, but don&#x27;t think less important step.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product twice a day for 2 weeks now and it seems to work. Its not some amazing plaque removing liquid like some others are making it seem but little by little its doing what its supposed to do, i would recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> The first time using it I can tell me teeth are much cleaner than brushing alone.  I can only see improvements to come!</li>
    <li> Plax has been discontinued in many areas, or out of availability for months, so finding it here was wonderful. I can&#x27;t live without my morning Plax! It&#x27;s fresh; it wakes you up; it&#x27;s pleasant tasting.</li>
    <li> have been using this product for a few years TASTES GREAT and loosens up plaque on teeth and in mouth. Use BEFORE you brush your teeth. Very effective.</li>
    <li> I have used Plax for years.  For some reason I can no longer buy it in my area.  I searched for it on line and found it.  I believe the prerinse helps me to keep my teeth cleaner than normal.  I tried other products and the taste was terrible.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was feeling like my teeth just weren&#x27;t quite as white as they could be but I didn&#x27;t want to buy a whitening kit because one in the past caused bad tooth sensitivity. I noticed a difference after about 3 uses. My teeth were noticeably whiter and they&#x27;ve continued to stay that way since I&#x27;ve been using it. It&#x27;s really mild and won&#x27;t burn or sting and gives a nice little minty taste before you brush.</li>
    <li> i was brushing daily but on multiple times a day... There I said it.&lt;br /&gt;I had build up behind my lower front teeth and I was embarrassed. I started using this product and within days it was just falling off. Within weeks most of the tarter was gone.&lt;br /&gt;Went to the dentist for a cleaning and they said my teeth looked decent for not going to dentist in 7 years.&lt;br /&gt;This is now part of my daily brushing 3x a day.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. During my recovery from shoulder surgery my flossing habit died. I also used to go to the dentist every  6-months without fail.  However, for a period of about 4 years I didn&#x27;t go to the dentist at all.  When I finally made a dentist appointment I was sure my dentist would chastise me for my lack of flossing.  However, much to my surprise I was told that my gums were in great shape and that I  had very little plaque build-up.  The only thing I can contribute this to is Plax.</li>
    <li> Ingredients are absolutely horrific. Who wants to put that stuff in their body?? Artificial colors, SLS, Saccharin? There are other rinse and mouthwash products out there that have safe ingredients and are very efficient. I&#x27;d much rather go to the dentist every 6 months and get a cleaning, than use this product. I am shocked at all the 5-star reviews. People need to educate themselves and read about each ingredient before using this product. And not on Wikipedia!!</li>
    <li> Seem Like it&#x27;s working , Well know on my next Dental appointment.</li>
    <li> It works. I don&#x27;t care what any ADA study says, Plax has safely and effectively aided in the removal of plaque from the back of my lower teeth. I brush, floss, use mouthwash and water pik daily, but plaque still built up on the back of my lower teeth. I started using Plax and within a week the plaque that was once smooth and hard began feeling porous and rough when my tongue rubbed against it. A few days later it started flaking off at the toothlines where I floss. Even more came off when I used a Dental Pik. Within three weeks there was a significant and measurable reduction in the amount of plaque on my teeth, and there is less and less everyday. I am confident that if I do an update a month from now, there will be little if any left. I highly recommend this product. If you use it and it doesn&#x27;t work, you are out about $10 bucks. It is worth it. I doubt Plax alone would have done anything, but combined with flossing( X2 a day), brushing( X3), and using a non-alcohol based mouth wash( X2), my oral hygiene has improved dramatically.</li>
    <li> Here are the ingredients, from the Plax website.  Now, which ingredients actually do any good?:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Water, Sorbitol Solution, Alcohol (8.7%), Tetrasodium Pyrophosphate, Benzoic Acid, Flavor, Poloxamer 407, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Sodium Saccharin, Xanthan Gum, FD&amp;C Red No. 40.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first one, I think.  Save your money?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Joe</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product and I am happy to have found this smaller bottle size. It shouldn&#x27;t be so hard to find.</li>
    <li> I just love this stuff. It works really well, as long as you follow the directions. Make sure you rinse BEFORE you brush. I use it twice daily and have noticed not only a reduction in plaque, but also whiter teeth. I will never stop buying Plax. Nothing else comes close!</li>
    <li> For me, I discovered that I had rather thick tartar on my bottom front teeth and just some tartar on the rest. Since it was a while since I had my teeth cleaned at the dentist, I decided to try this first so my next cleaning would not take so long and be so painful. Hate to get my teeth cleaned because the pick hurts my gums and makes them bleed, having to leave my mouth open so long...You probaly get the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results for me: So I followed the instructions and did the rinsing TWICE a day due to my heavy buildup of tartar. After just about 10 days, I was brushing and a big clump of tartar (seemed large to me) in my bathroom sink! After I finished brushing, I placed my dental mirror and noticed that lots of tartar was GONE! And where the tartar was, shiny white teeth showed through.&lt;br /&gt;And I am still using it and much of the thick tartar is gone! And I cannot see any of the other tartar from the other teeth, so I think all of that is gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**PLAX really works, however, keep in mind that this is my own results, but I wanted to let you know that I had a heavy tartar buildup and this works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend PLAX!</li>
    <li> My sister recommended this product to me so I bought it, but didn&#x27;t have high hopes because I am pessimistic about 99% of products (I&#x27;ve been disappointed too many times). I was pleasantly surprise that it eliminated about 95% of my tartar the very first time I used it. The only issue I have is that it didn&#x27;t dissolve the tartar between my teeth, even with flossing. I haven&#x27;t used this product in about two weeks to prevent possible damage due to overuse. So I&#x27;ll keep using it to see if it eventually dissolve the stubborn tartar in between my teeth. Another great thing about this rinse is that it has a nice mild mint flavor that doesn&#x27;t burn. I expected a product that dissolves plaque/tartar would taste like turpentine and burn like hell fire, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I read somewhere that using this Plax rinse would help loosen plaque on teeth when used before brushing.  I am about half way through this bottle of plax and can see a very slight difference.  I have been rinsing with this before I brush and rinsing for a minute or longer, flossing and brushing.  I do still have some plaque I just can&#x27;t get rid of but am hoping if I continue to use this it may loosen up at some point and I can get rid of it.  I am ordering more of this to continue this routine to see how that works.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! My teeth feel cleaner and look whiter after every use</li>
    <li> This stuff seems to really work!</li>
    <li> This product really works, my teeth never looked nor felt clean. It really helps with plaque control</li>
    <li> Product received promptly and as advertised.</li>
    <li> I USED PLAX ADVANCED FORMULA, AND I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH RESULTS.  WITHIN WEEKS I SAW REALLY GOODS RESULTS. IT WORKS FAST AND COULD SAVE YOU A LOT OF EXPENSE AT DENTIST FFICE.</li>
    <li> very effective mouthwash</li>
    <li> This stuff works pretty darned well - my teeth definitely feel cleaner with it.  However, if I use it too often it starts burning my gums so I don&#x27;t use it but 3X a week or so.  Other than that I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> This product leaves your teeth clean and smooth.</li>
    <li> Great product to user in between professional dental cleanings.  I have been using this for four days now and my teeth are visibly whiter. Every time I use this stuff my mouth feels clean and fresh just like it does after I get my cleanings. Tarter that builds up between teeth is easily removed with a toothbrush and/or scraper.  I always rinse first for about 30 seconds to one minute then I leave some in my mouth and begin brushing work my whitening toothpaste. Then,  I floss and rinse again with a regular mouthwash for protection throughout the day.  My mouth feels clean and fresh all day.  I have never had a dentist or hygienist mention this product to me and I&#x27;m sure I know why. Because it works! I didn&#x27;t buy it here because it&#x27;s way more expensive than one of the local stores in my area. Anyway,  if you&#x27;re looking to reduce plaque and tarter buildup this will help tremendously.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this.  He has to have it and it has become hard to find locally, so I looked it up on Amazon.  My husband says that it really works.  His dental hygienist told him about it.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash is fabulous. I could feel the plaque disappearing. I suffer from dry mouth because of some medications I am taking and this really helps my teeth feel cleaner.</li>
    <li> They product really freshens the breathe and protects teeth and gums from tartar build up. I have only been able to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I was skeptical at first about this product. The claims that it could completely clear tartar buildup seemed bogus to me, especially since the alternative is paying $500 at the dentist to have it removed. I saved $489 because of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t seen a dentist since I was about 10 years old and I have a lot of hard, rough tartar buildup on the back of my bottom front teeth. Smiling was ugly because you could see the dark brown between my bottom teeth. I&#x27;m not afraid to smile anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for about 3 weeks, my tartar buildup is almost completely gone. The brown calculus that ringed the bottom of my teeth and stuck between them is gone and all I have is the coating to scrape off of the back planes. I&#x27;ve never been excited to feel chips breaking off of my teeth while flossing and brushing. Just some inside info: I did rinse my mouth with this product for 1 minute instead of the recommended 30 seconds, would then floss and brush with a baking soda toothpaste before rinsing with mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to keep this on my shelf. It works like a charm. :)</li>
    <li> The red formula appears to be stronger and works better so I would go with that one.</li>
    <li> I read many reviews from multiple sources prior to ordering Plax.  I was looking for a dental rinse to aid in reduction of plaque build up and prevention of new plaque forming.  I typically use this daily in the morning prior to brushing as directed.  I usually swish for one minute or more, then brush.  I noticed a reduction of slight plaque build up between teeth within two weeks.  Overall whiteness of teeth also improved.  I highly recommend this product.  With prolonged swishing time, your tongue tends to be sensitive, but this abates shortly.</li>
    <li> Works great even after first time makes your teeth feel smooth and clean and really does wash away gunk away brushing and or mouthwash</li>
    <li> Seems to really work as plaque remove, unfortunately, it&#x27;s so harsh that I can&#x27;t use it as often as I would like.</li>
    <li> OK, I wanted to wait a bit before writing my review as there are some reviews that claim some pretty terrific results with Plax.  Both my hubby and I using this every day.  We brush our teeth with regular toothpaste, then we take a small amount of Plax and swish around our mouth, then we brush again with the Plax still in our mouth.  I have to say that even after the first time we tried this, we both realized that our teeth even felt MUCH cleaner and SMOOTH.  I had tartar buildup and by using Plax regularly and using a dental type pick, I was able to remove the plaque over a period of about a month.  This may sound like a long time, but that plaque had been there for a long time (I didn&#x27;t know it was there until my dentist pointed it out).  Anyway, because we don&#x27;t have dental insurance now, this did a great job of making my teeth cleaner and getting rid of tartar and removing plaque.  This is a great product that we will continue to use.  The only downside is that it is kind of expensive so we try to use sparingly - but to be honest that is all you need, a small bit of the Plax each time.</li>
    <li> So after reading great reviews on this product I wanted to try it. After buying it I realized one of the main ingredients is alcohol, which is linked to oral cancer. If you notice in the store, many mouth washes say alcohol free for that reason. I would never have bought this product if I knew that.</li>
    <li> Unlike most other brands, this is a pre-rinse. Use before you brush. I find it has worked really well over the years - my dentist remarked on how much better my teeth and gums were after I started using it.</li>
