    <li> This product keeps my hands from cracking in the winter and keeps my nose from chapping when I have a cold.  If used sparingly it is non-greasy.  I like the tubes because the unused product stays clean; the jars always get contaminated.  The stores in my area only cary the Eucerin Original in jars, so I was glad to find it online in tubes.  My only complaint is that I had to buy a 6-pack, which is a 2-3 year supply.</li>
    <li> I listen to doctors.  Sometimes they are right.  In this case, my dry skin was very taken with this cream.  Well done doctor.</li>
    <li> This product is nothing short of miraculous!  I have used a number of moisterizers, both commercial and prescribed to keep my moderate facial exzema at bay. This is the only product that delivered for me. Really delivers as a moisterizer and greatly helos in healing exzema. I cannot be without it. A word of caution: use a small amount and dab onto face and then work it in.  Too much and you may have a reaction in that your pores can become clogged. I always recommend this product to people needing help with a moisterizer for their Exzema.</li>
    <li> I have been using Eucerin cream since I was a teenage. My dermatologist started me on it. I love Eucerin because it moisturizes my very sensitive skin without clogging pores.</li>
    <li> Love it and use it regularly!</li>
    <li> I have mild eczema and this cream (recommended by my doctor) works as well as any prescription cream I have tried.</li>
    <li> for dry cracked skin.... GET THIS NOW</li>
    <li> I have used this for at least 10 years and it is the very best of anything on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was recommended by my dermatologist and I have used nothing else since. I have been given other kinds of hand and body creams and lotions to try, but none of them can compaire with Eucerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I do want to note that I only use the cream and not the lotion. The lotion does not seem to be the same and I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> Hard to squeeze out of the tube and also hard to smooth onto the skin.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly and the size of the tubes are great for handbags, pockets, or to carry on a plane.  My daughter loves the repair creme. She is a nurse, and keeps it all the time it is really great for the dry hand she gets from all the antiseptic use.</li>
    <li> Cold, dry winters + paper &#x3D; papercuts. I put a stop to them long ago with Eucerin. You don&#x27;t need to use much, and it really helps to use it right after washing your hands so the moisture is sealed in. Now my hands remain soft and cut-free!</li>
    <li> Eucerin is my favorite repair creme, but, i must confess, it is not the only product&lt;br /&gt;I use.  I have severely dry skin and have not been able to find anything that works&lt;br /&gt;better than Eucerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, there is a reason I use other products as well.  Eucerin is a thick paste&lt;br /&gt;that can be difficult to soften up - particularly in the winter.  Sometimes I need&lt;br /&gt;something that can act quickly with little effort.  There are a number of cremes&lt;br /&gt;on the market that meet that need.  The issue with the other cremes is that the&lt;br /&gt;effects are limited (in my case) to a few hours.  Whereas Eucerin will last 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the most convenient way to use Eucerin on the go.</li>
    <li> Work with my hands a lot, helps them to heal. Extremely thick. Not a body lotion or glider at all.</li>
    <li> I love this hand cream, and these tubes are the perfect size to carry in my purse.  As you might anticipate, some of the product gets wasted with this packaging, but given the benefits it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> This is great for popping into ones purse, pocket, or glovebox. Eucerin was recommended to me in 1974 by a dermotologist. I&#x27;ve used it with integrity all these 39 years. WOW!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product, it gave me before the due date and is just as it was in the pictures, I recommend it to all</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t get enough of this product have been using for 30 years. a thick cream, and it does the trick</li>
    <li> it works!  it&#x27;s thick and hard to squeeze tube.  didn&#x27;t want to put my long nails into the jar.  so delivery is a problem, but the creme works wonders on dry skin.</li>
    <li> love this stuff. super thick. I put it on my hand or feet before bed with cotton gloves and socks. When I wake up my raw hands feel so much better and my heals are better. I have a connective tissue disorder which includes my skin chaffing really easy (especially if dry) and this stuff really helps with that too on my inner thighs and inner knee areas where my pants rub. Helps better than other stuff I have tried in the past.</li>
