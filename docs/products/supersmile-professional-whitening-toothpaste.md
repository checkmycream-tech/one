      <li>tastes good and leaves teeth feeling so clean</li>
      <li>Dealing with amazon is so nice and easy.  </li>
      <li>I was not at all pleased with Supersmile.</li>
      <li>I have tried many whitening toothpastes before, but they didn&#x27;t help.</li>
      <li>Have been usimg Supersmile for years and love it.  </li>
      <li>Most products do not.</li>
      <li>I love the Supersmile toothpaste and hope to get some more when I run out.  </li>
      <li>The toothpaste is okay</li>
      <li>always love this toothpaste</li>
      <li>I am hoping in more time to start seeing a difference.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Hopefully produces bright smile.</li>
      <li>So I was using the toothpaste and saw more change from it than from the trays and with no soreness</li>
      <li>that was top of the list...</li>
      <li>When I have my teeth cleaned, DDS always comments on how healthy my gums are.</li>
      <li>I really love supersmile toothpaste.</li>
      <li>This toothpaste is okay</li>
      <li>but I was expecting more.</li>
      <li>Perhaps it will take more than a month.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for many years.  </li>
      <li>Love this toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>but I love the taste and the way my teeth look.</li>
      <li>Like it because it is not gloppy like most toothpastes; my teeth feel the cleanest they have every felt, not &amp;#34;sweaters&amp;#34; ever.</li>
      <li>Love this toothpaste makes my mouth and teeth feel so nice and clean after each use.  </li>
      <li>I liked how fresh my mouth felt after using it!</li>
      <li>However, I don&#x27;t feel like my teeth get very clean</li>
      <li>remember use a dry tooth brush its perfect to maintain your whitened teeth twice a day</li>
      <li>I do like to get the check ups though to make sure my teeth are sound.</li>
      <li>I love original mint because it tastes like toms,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the strips and other toothpastes and this is the best product I&#x27;ve found to date.</li>
      <li>And the cleaning itself is so easy.</li>
      <li>Clean and healthy.</li>
      <li>Easily pays for this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I was kind of leary of the claims about this toothpaste when I first saw this product on the \\&quot;Joan Rivers</li>
      <li>I was delighted with my new smile--brighter and whiter, without that unnaturally bleached look.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use whitening toothpaste that makes a huge difference if you are a coffee drinker.</li>
      <li>Fine.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a huge savings if you do not have dental insurance.  </li>
      <li>It does help to keep the teeth white and tastes great too.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product&lt;</li>
      <li>Thank you Dr. Smigel for such a great product.</li>
      <li>But if you want to feel like you love yourself, this is something worth trying.</li>
      <li>Makes your teeth feel so clean &amp; smooth.</li>
      <li>Still looking into professional whitening, but for a quick fix it seems to work fairly well.  </li>
      <li>I originally bought this toothpaste from my cosmetic dentist in Scottsdale.</li>
      <li>so far very satisfied</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t feel that my teeth are clean after I use it, so I have to use another brand of toothpaste after I brush with Supersmile.</li>
      <li>how clean my mouth feels after using it.</li>
      <li>They just stay clean with this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I would recommend it to anyone looking to present a great smile and protect their investment.  </li>
      <li>Makes my teeth feel clean and look whiter.</li>
      <li>so I am going to order 2 tubes right now so that I am stocked up!</li>
      <li>It is so far the best teeth whitener that I have ever used and is definitely worth the price in the overall scheme of teeth products and services that could be used to remove stains.</li>
      <li>bit\\&quot;, but not significantly enough for me to say that it was a good investment.</li>
      <li>Good after taste, not really gritty, and tube will last a good while.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m getting ready to order more now.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t explain it, Of all the toothpastes I&#x27;ve ever used my mouth feels amazingly clean when I use super</li>
      <li>It is also a good acne remedy if you mix it with a little neosporin : )</li>
      <li>The purchase came quickly and I would buy it again when needed.</li>
      <li>Would love a Kindle, but they are still too high, even on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Or try Himalayan brand whitening, it did more than any other kind i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>In my opinion, this toothpaste&#x27;s effectiveness increases if you use it at night before going to bed as you will have had a full day&#x27;s worth of meals and activities.</li>
      <li>I had used the Super Smile system since January.</li>
      <li>My teeth feel and look great after just a few days.</li>
      <li>Either way, I am satisfied so far.</li>
      <li>I do like it&#x27;s fresh taste and</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with my Neways/Modere more natural stuff.</li>
      <li>I just spent a good deal of money on my teeth.</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t want a  dull,scratched looking smile.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pricey but worth it for me.  </li>
      <li>It gives you immediate brightness, and the longer it&#x27;s used the brighter your smile becomes.  </li>
      <li>I HONESTLY see a big difference in the color of my teeth.</li>
      <li>... been looking so long to find something easy, tastes great, and actually works....</li>
      <li>We tried other whitening products but none worked as good as this one.&lt;br /&gt;u.</li>
      <li>Seems to be doing the trick, my teeth have not had a drastic change, but look good none the less.  </li>
      <li>I previously ordered it on TV channel show and loved it.  </li>
      <li>I have mild periodontal disease and my gums seem much healthier looking too.</li>
      <li>Leaves my teeth feeling so smooth and clean and white.</li>
      <li>I guess the best thing about the product is that a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>I love coffee and red wine</li>
      <li>/&gt;Personally, I saw results after two weeks of consistent use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I really see a great difference in whitening of my teeth...</li>
      <li>It really works wonders in teeth whitening!  </li>
      <li>Very thankful for finding this toothpaste!</li>
      <li>People always comment on how pretty my teeth are, and I credit that to SuperSmile toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>It has helped brighten my teeth and  also works on my veneers, which is why I bought it for a try in the first place.  </li>
      <li>It works, but the consistently of the product does take some getting used to.</li>
      <li>I then purchased Colgate Optic white and achieved much better results.</li>
      <li>have been using it since the product first launched.</li>
      <li>I looked closely again, and my teeth are uniformly white and stain free!  </li>
      <li>Overall a good product, need to be used with regular toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive teeth and can&#x27;t use a lot  of tooth pastes that contain whitening properties but have been using this one for 6 months and haven&#x27;t had any issues but a much whiter smile!</li>
      <li>The ingredients seem to be very strong, so I try to mix up with other toothpastes.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to use on a dry toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I have used super smile on and off for years, in short it works!</li>
      <li>I use a little of this with my regular toothpaste and together they seem to work great.  </li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>It does not have an offensive taste and really makes my teeth whiter.  </li>
      <li>you should know that using whitening toothpastes can take away the protective glaze of your teeth and then stains can happen faster then real enamel, like from berries or coffeeeeeeeee.....</li>
      <li>so, this supersmile whitens without scrubbing off any layers, just absorbing stains.....</li>
      <li>I was really hoping this toothpaste would work, based on all the reviews.  </li>
      <li>It really does the job of cleaning before whitening.</li>
      <li>What the dentist had him use did not help much.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t seen much improvement after 5 weeks use as directed ...</li>
      <li>I really like this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>It shows a difference with a much lower price.  </li>
      <li>I really like this tooth paste.</li>
      <li>Really like this whitening toothpaste and have used it for years.  </li>
      <li>fast shipping...</li>
      <li>I really like this tooth paste.</li>
      <li>works very well with vaneers</li>
      <li>I have used it for years because my dentist recommended it and because it really does work to maintain tooth whiteness.  </li>
      <li>Took a couple of weeks until I started to see a real whitening difference.</li>
      <li>Makes my teeth smooth &amp; kept white used every day.</li>
      <li>Not noticing much difference for the money.</li>
      <li>It really does whiten.</li>
      <li>The real reason I keep using it is that it has eliminated plaque build-up between my lower front teeth.</li>
      <li>I liked it but not sure it made that much of a difference in my teeth color!</li>
      <li>I expected more from this product particularly considering the cost.  </li>
      <li>as most other toothpastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live with out this product!</li>
      <li>It is worth the extra cost, absolutely.</li>
      <li>highly recommend</li>
      <li>Only drawback is the price, but it is definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>but it definitely helps and is worth it.</li>
      <li>For that reason alone, I think it is worth 3 times the price of regular tooth paste.</li>
      <li>My FAVORITE toothpaste EVER----Just wish it cost LESS!</li>
      <li>You actually notice a difference after the first time.</li>
      <li>so I can honestly say it simply does as much or less than any regular whitening toothpaste.</li>
      <li>It really does keep your teeth white.</li>
      <li>Yes, it did help whiten my natural and bonded teeth \\&quot;a</li>
      <li>I used toms natural toothpase spearmint for 20 years on my veneers</li>
      <li>Wow.  </li>
      <li>Fixed the spots on my veneers from mouth wash the dentist gave me.</li>
      <li>I had developed staining on my teeth from prescription Peridex.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;i have sensitive teeth</li>
      <li>You only use a little bit of it, so it lasts as well or better than regular toothpaste.</li>
      <li>You only need a small pea-sized amount and a dry toothbrush to use it effectively.</li>
      <li>Last a long time because you don&#x27;t have to use much.</li>
      <li>I have used this toothpaste for years, since the early to mid 90&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I have only used this twice so far, but this morning I woke up</li>
      <li>Supersmile Whitening Toothpaste delivers on its promise  not only  to whiten teeth several shades, but to keep them white is the absolute truth.  </li>

<li> I have sensitive teeth and can&#x27;t use a lot  of tooth pastes that contain whitening properties but have been using this one for 6 months and haven&#x27;t had any issues but a much whiter smile!</li>
<li> The ingredients seem to be very strong, so I try to mix up with other toothpastes.  </li>
<li> Be sure to use on a dry toothbrush.</li>
<li> I have used super smile on and off for years, in short it works!</li>
<li> I use a little of this with my regular toothpaste and together they seem to work great.  </li>
<li> Fast delivery.</li>
<li> It does not have an offensive taste and really makes my teeth whiter.  </li>
<li> you should know that using whitening toothpastes can take away the protective glaze of your teeth and then stains can happen faster then real enamel, like from berries or coffeeeeeeeee.....</li>
<li> so, this supersmile whitens without scrubbing off any layers, just absorbing stains.....</li>
<li> I was really hoping this toothpaste would work, based on all the reviews.  </li>
<li> It really does the job of cleaning before whitening.</li>
<li> What the dentist had him use did not help much.</li>
<li> Haven&#x27;t seen much improvement after 5 weeks use as directed ...</li>
<li> I really like this toothpaste.</li>
<li> It shows a difference with a much lower price.  </li>
<li> I really like this tooth paste.</li>
<li> Really like this whitening toothpaste and have used it for years.  </li>
<li> fast shipping...</li>
<li> I really like this tooth paste.</li>
<li> works very well with vaneers</li>
<li> I have used it for years because my dentist recommended it and because it really does work to maintain tooth whiteness.  </li>
<li> Took a couple of weeks until I started to see a real whitening difference.</li>
<li> Makes my teeth smooth &amp; kept white used every day.</li>
<li> Not noticing much difference for the money.</li>
<li> It really does whiten.</li>
<li> The real reason I keep using it is that it has eliminated plaque build-up between my lower front teeth.</li>
<li> I liked it but not sure it made that much of a difference in my teeth color!</li>
<li> I expected more from this product particularly considering the cost.  </li>
<li> as most other toothpastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t live with out this product!</li>
<li> It is worth the extra cost, absolutely.</li>
<li> highly recommend</li>
<li> Only drawback is the price, but it is definitely worth it.</li>
<li> but it definitely helps and is worth it.</li>
<li> For that reason alone, I think it is worth 3 times the price of regular tooth paste.</li>
<li> My FAVORITE toothpaste EVER----Just wish it cost LESS!</li>
<li> You actually notice a difference after the first time.</li>
<li> so I can honestly say it simply does as much or less than any regular whitening toothpaste.</li>
<li> It really does keep your teeth white.</li>
<li> Yes, it did help whiten my natural and bonded teeth \\&quot;a</li>
<li> I used toms natural toothpase spearmint for 20 years on my veneers</li>
<li> Wow.  </li>
<li> Fixed the spots on my veneers from mouth wash the dentist gave me.</li>
<li> I had developed staining on my teeth from prescription Peridex.  </li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;i have sensitive teeth</li>
<li> You only use a little bit of it, so it lasts as well or better than regular toothpaste.</li>
<li> You only need a small pea-sized amount and a dry toothbrush to use it effectively.</li>
<li> Last a long time because you don&#x27;t have to use much.</li>
<li> I have used this toothpaste for years, since the early to mid 90&#x27;s.</li>
<li> I have only used this twice so far, but this morning I woke up</li>
<li> Supersmile Whitening Toothpaste delivers on its promise  not only  to whiten teeth several shades, but to keep them white is the absolute truth.  </li>
<li> If you use a pee size daily it will last a long time.</li>
<li> I used this toothpaste exclusively for the past 6 months (with a sonicare) and exactly as directed (with a dry toothbrush) and noticed no change whatsoever.  </li>
<li> Peridex can really stain teeth, but I can already see a difference after a few days of using it!  </li>
<li> Haven&#x27;t really seen results, but that&#x27;s hard to do when you&#x27;re checking daily!</li>
<li> Brushing in a circular motion for two mins morning and night is not a big deal and when I used it 3-4 times daily due to having forgotten to take my other toothpaste on a short trip, the extra brushings made a difference, too.  </li>
<li> Well excuse me for ordering by phone.</li>
<li> up on Supersmile products, only for a big let down.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using supersmile for the last 4 or 5 years and will not use any other brand.</li>
<li> Then the other day, someone my age asked how I keep my teeth so white!  </li>
<li> but I didn&#x27;t use it very long.</li>
<li> Remember to use a dry toothbrush.  </li>
<li> Remember to use with a dry toothbrush.</li>
<li> Whitening strips had worked for years, but had stopped working, so I had spent the money for trays from the dentist and used these for a couple of weeks.  </li>
<li> several shades after I used it for a few months.  </li>
<li> This is a big waste of money.  </li>
<li> I have veneers and this is one of the few products that will help keep veneers white and help with coffee stains.</li>
<li> teeth looked whiter, literally... but then seemed more susceptible to staining... and got worse and worse...</li>
<li> With all the positive reviews I was hopeful, but unfortunately it wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
<li> I only purchased the toothpaste so not sure that makes a difference.  </li>
<li> but I found no difference in the effects of this toothpaste than other paste I&#x27;ve used.</li>
<li> but I needed to stop due to sore gums.  </li>
<li> I also didn&#x27;t notice any tooth sensitivity after my usage (as I have with other whitening products).</li>
<li> My teeth feel cleaner after using this toothpaste and any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
<li> Other whitening toothpastes irritate my gums, but this one does not.</li>
<li> just like other products out there, it does not work AT ALL.  </li>
<li> very spearmint and not burning fake mint.</li>
<li> Absolutely not worth it.</li>
<li> I am concerned about one reviewer&#x27;s comment that the teeth re-discolor when one stops using the toothpaste, but will wait until something unavoidable happens to provide the test...meanwhile just continuing to brush at least twice daily and appreciate the fact that something does seem to work with minimal expense and trouble.....</li>
<li> The downside like any other teeth whitening products it is not permanent, hence four star rating and cause little to no sensitivity issue.</li>
<li> so when his big-boy teeth came in, they were typically stained.  </li>
<li> It goes quickly, no poking, almost no scraping.</li>
<li> Item received was runny compared to my previous tube.  </li>
<li> I drink tea and coffee, and this toothpaste seems to remove that stains that typically come from those types of beverages.</li>
<li> I just wish that it would product the results in less time.  </li>
<li> Worked to whiten my teeth slightly.  </li>
<li> For the cost of this product, I thought I would see a little improvement.  </li>
<li> Little by little, the product is making my teeth whiter.  </li>
<li> It did a little</li>
<li> but not really better that other whitening toothpaste</li>
<li> I think it helps whiten my teeth a little</li>
<li> We&#x27;re not impressed so far, but he will continue to use it until the tube is gone.</li>
<li> After a few months I went to my dentist for a whitening session.  </li>
<li> I flossed everyday, and I still used to get a yellowy build up between cleanings.</li>
<li> Its not a strong toothpaste with the smell and taste of mint.  </li>
<li> Although it is expensive, it is the only toothpaste I use.</li>
<li> Arrived quickly as usual.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure why this didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
<li> but now that I have 16 brand new porcelain crowns that were very expensive</li>
<li> I was very skeptical of this claim to whiten veneers, but it works even on my 20 yr old veneers which had become discolored just with age.  </li>
<li> For some reasons, I find it difficult to remember not to wet the brush before applying the paste.</li>
<li> No more!</li>
<li> And it&#x27;s way less expensive than Supersmile.  </li>
<li> I would try over the counter, less expensive before using this.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t like to texture (I know that&#x27;s a little weird).</li>
<li> I am so sorry that I wasted my money on this product.</li>
<li> I have been using it for approximately three weeks and have not seen any difference in stain removal.  </li>
<li> This was an expensive experiment, that turned into a failure.  </li>
<li> a little disappointed with this toothpaste.</li>
<li> Sorry</li>
<li> /&gt;It was totally weird.</li>
<li> I realize it&#x27;s quite expensive</li>
<li> It is very expensive.</li>
<li> After one week of continuous use, I was disappointed.  </li>
<li> I hate to say this</li>
<li> It sticks to your teeth even after your rinse, so don&#x27;t be too shocked!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this all the time.  It did whiten my teeth.  You do have to continue using it to keep the results.</li>
    <li> My son had lots of antibiotics when he was a baby so when his big-boy teeth came in, they were typically stained.  This helped to whiten his teeth, not remove all the staining but a big improvement.</li>
    <li> I was not at all pleased with Supersmile. I saw no difference whatsoever in the color of my teeth. I ordered by phone, and was not told that the 30 day supply came with an automatic shipment in 30 days for a 90 day supply and a charge to my card of over $114. When I called to protest, I was told that if I had ordered through their website, I would&#x27;ve seen the details of the 30 day offer. Well excuse me for ordering by phone. I threatened to contact the AG--that&#x27;s when the operator told me to do what I need to do and hung up on me. I don&#x27;t trust this company and would not recommend it to anyone. Did I mention that I was dissatisfied with the product?</li>
    <li> My wife and I both use Supersmile.  It really does keep your teeth white.</li>
    <li> Seems to be doing the trick, my teeth have not had a drastic change, but look good none the less.  I only purchased the toothpaste so not sure that makes a difference.  Either way, I am satisfied so far.</li>
    <li> This is a third Supersmile what we are using. I am recommending to everyone. I have tried many whitening toothpastes before, but they didn&#x27;t help. My dentist recommended Supersmile and my teeth are really white in a very short time.  This toothpaste is really very very very very good for smokers, as well. This is the best toothpaste so far what we have use. Fast delivery. Good price. Happy for my purchase.</li>
    <li> By far the best whitening toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried.  It does not have an offensive taste and really makes my teeth whiter.  Only drawback is the price, but it is definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Have been usimg Supersmile for years and love it.  It does help to keep the teeth white and tastes great too.</li>
    <li> I believe this product is working on the staining problem.  Most products do not.</li>
    <li> I hate to say this but I found no difference in the effects of this toothpaste than other paste I&#x27;ve used. Yes, it did help whiten my natural and bonded teeth \\&quot;a bit\\&quot;, but not significantly enough for me to say that it was a good investment. I will not be purchasing this product again. Sorry</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already written a review, but I&#x27;ll do it again for you.  Dealing with amazon is so nice and easy.  Every purchase I&#x27;ve done with you has been great.  I love the Supersmile toothpaste and hope to get some more when I run out.  Just hope the price is low for me!    Thank you for your follow-up.  Would love a Kindle, but they are still too high, even on Amazon.  Any last minute sales, let me know on anything.    Donna Grubbs</li>
    <li> Have used for 8 years. I have porcelain veneers. My veneers were to last 10 years. They look perfect after 20!!!</li>
    <li> The toothpaste is okay, I don&#x27;t feel that my teeth are clean after I use it, so I have to use another brand of toothpaste after I brush with Supersmile. Maybe I should have gotten the accelerator to use with it.</li>
    <li> I used toms natural toothpase spearmint for 20 years on my veneers but now that I have 16 brand new porcelain crowns that were very expensive I switched to supersmile. I love original mint because it tastes like toms, very spearmint and not burning fake mint. If you have porcelain teeth you should know that using whitening toothpastes can take away the protective glaze of your teeth and then stains can happen faster then real enamel, like from berries or coffeeeeeeeee.....so, this supersmile whitens without scrubbing off any layers, just absorbing stains.....so it is a must!!</li>
    <li> I originally bought this toothpaste from my cosmetic dentist in Scottsdale. It is the BEST. You actually notice a difference after the first time. Its the only whitening toothpaste that has the same ingredients as the pros use in the whitening trays. I can&#x27;t live with out this product!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product&lt;br /&gt;So great to be able to ordef on line instead of waiting for my dentist to order it. Have and will continue to use for years</li>
    <li> I have used super smile on and off for years, in short it works! The downside like any other teeth whitening products it is not permanent, hence four star rating and cause little to no sensitivity issue. Overall a good product, need to be used with regular toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Like this product immensely. Would recommend to othets</li>
    <li> always love this toothpaste</li>
    <li> I have been using it for approximately three weeks and have not seen any difference in stain removal.  I am hoping in more time to start seeing a difference. I do like it&#x27;s fresh taste and how clean my mouth feels after using it.</li>
    <li> I used the system for 30 days with no results or improvemsnts in the whiteness of my teeth..  I bought the 30 day supply then found out that they automatically sign you up for a 90 supply. Tried to cancel and was told I have to take all the shipments or reurn them.  What a hassle.  Would not recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Need an electric toothbrush yo get optimum results</li>
    <li> Love this paste!  I previously ordered it on TV channel show and loved it.  But they don&#x27;t offer paste alone!  You have to buy rinse, pretreatment, etc.  So, I bought it here!  Works great for me!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite toothpaste. I&#x27;ve used it for years. Makes your teeth feel so clean &amp; smooth. Be sure to use on a dry toothbrush. Just takes a pea-size amount. Amazon has best price!</li>
    <li> But it has made some difference. I guess the best thing about the product is that a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, your mouth feels like you just came from the dentist ! I have been using this product for about 2 years.</li>
    <li> Nice taste.  Hopefully produces bright smile.</li>
    <li> My FAVORITE toothpaste EVER----Just wish it cost LESS!</li>
    <li> LOVE! I love this tooth paste and use it all the time! I like to use it at night because I feel in the am I want something a tad stronger but this does wonders to keep teeth white! I love coffee and red wine so I like all the help I can get! I used to use the accelerator but don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s totally necessary anymore!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dental hygienist and I approve the his paste! It works great after professional bleaching to maintain optimum results! I recommend it to all my patients!</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical of this claim to whiten veneers, but it works even on my 20 yr old veneers which had become discolored just with age.  Whitening strips had worked for years, but had stopped working, so I had spent the money for trays from the dentist and used these for a couple of weeks.  They would probably have worked (from the back side of the teeth according to my dentist) but I needed to stop due to sore gums.  So I was using the toothpaste and saw more change from it than from the trays and with no soreness (and I do not have tender gums at all) so stopped the trays and do not plan to use them.  Brushing in a circular motion for two mins morning and night is not a big deal and when I used it 3-4 times daily due to having forgotten to take my other toothpaste on a short trip, the extra brushings made a difference, too.  I am concerned about one reviewer&#x27;s comment that the teeth re-discolor when one stops using the toothpaste, but will wait until something unavoidable happens to provide the test...meanwhile just continuing to brush at least twice daily and appreciate the fact that something does seem to work with minimal expense and trouble.....I do drink tea and coffee daily, but not red wine.....</li>
    <li> I read the different reviews and this was the &amp;#34; Whitening&amp;#34; toothpaste  that was top of the list...&lt;br /&gt;Guess what? It works...</li>
    <li> Another good product and price to order through Amazon.  We tried other whitening products but none worked as good as this one.&lt;br /&gt;u. magyar</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this twice a day, for several weeks.  We see no improvement on his beige teeth.  He doesn&#x27;t smoke, or drink alochol, yet his teeth are beige.  I was really hoping this toothpaste would work, based on all the reviews.  We&#x27;re not impressed so far, but he will continue to use it until the tube is gone.</li>
    <li> Easy to use whitening toothpaste that makes a huge difference if you are a coffee drinker. In my opinion, this toothpaste&#x27;s effectiveness increases if you use it at night before going to bed as you will have had a full day&#x27;s worth of meals and activities. The flavor of this toothpaste isn&#x27;t overpowering (I used the mint) and the consistency of this toothpaste is as most other toothpastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I saw results after two weeks of consistent use. I also didn&#x27;t notice any tooth sensitivity after my usage (as I have with other whitening products).</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste makes my mouth and teeth feel so nice and clean after each use.  Its not a strong toothpaste with the smell and taste of mint.  It really does the job of cleaning before whitening.</li>
    <li> This product seemed to work... but only if you DON&#x27;T drink wine or coffee or smoke again EVER!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth looked whiter, literally... but then seemed more susceptible to staining... and got worse and worse...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was totally weird. I will never buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with my Neways/Modere more natural stuff.</li>
    <li> I feel like this product is great.  I could tell a difference in the color of my teeth just after about 2 weeks.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Supersmile whitening tooth paste is the best.  I have tried others but none of them compares to Supersmile.  Thank you Dr. Smigel for such a great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I really see a great difference in whitening of my teeth...a little disappointed with this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t work at all!  For the cost of this product, I thought I would see a little improvement.  Not so.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste! Actually made my teeth noticeably whiter in just a couple weeks</li>
    <li> I have used this toothpaste for years, since the early to mid 90&#x27;s. When I have my teeth cleaned, DDS always comments on how healthy my gums are. And the cleaning itself is so easy. I always ask if that is it. It goes quickly, no poking, almost no scraping. They just stay clean with this toothpaste. Clean and healthy. I go for cleaning one time a year. I have gone longer which made no difference. I do like to get the check ups though to make sure my teeth are sound. I wish they made this without fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband would not use it untill about 3 years ago. He was having gum issues. What the dentist had him use did not help much. Finally he gave in and started using it and has had rave reviews on his improvement. Instead of going for cleanings 3 times a year he goes twice. He may be on his way to one time per year. That&#x27;s a huge savings if you do not have dental insurance.  Easily pays for this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I used Supersmile for a couple of months.  I was delighted with my new smile--brighter and whiter, without that unnaturally bleached look.  Fine.  I was a bit worried about Supersmile&#x27;s efficacy as a toothpaste, but my teeth looked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I discovered the Crest 3D line.  Wow.  Not only did 3D whiten my teeth beyond Supersmile, I trust Crest for dental hygiene.  The Supersmile is cosmetic, the Crest is great toothpaste.  I kept the Supersmile I already has for emergencies, but I&#x27;m sold on Crest 3D.  And it&#x27;s way less expensive than Supersmile.  Win all around!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just for the record, I used Supersmile a couple of years before Crest came out with the 3D.  My dentist  never commented on any problems nor did I develop any cavities.  I am not connected with Crest, its parent company or any affiliates, either</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste ever for crowns!  Doesn&#x27;t matter if you drink coffee or wine, the stains are gone.</li>
    <li> nope, didn&#x27;t work. i&#x27;m sticking with Organic Tumeric powder for whitening</li>
    <li> It really works wonders in teeth whitening!  Peridex can really stain teeth, but I can already see a difference after a few days of using it!  It is so far the best teeth whitener that I have ever used and is definitely worth the price in the overall scheme of teeth products and services that could be used to remove stains.</li>
    <li> Fixed the spots on my veneers from mouth wash the dentist gave me. Very thankful for finding this toothpaste!</li>
    <li> appears good...but using on bonded teeth...so unsure just &#x27;how&#x27; it affects same.</li>
    <li> I have only used this twice so far, but this morning I woke up and my teeth were whiter! Good after taste, not really gritty, and tube will last a good while. I use a sonic care essence toothbrush. Good buy.</li>
    <li> Item received was runny compared to my previous tube.  Hope it works as well but don&#x27;t feel very confident it will.</li>
    <li> People always comment on how pretty my teeth are, and I credit that to SuperSmile toothpaste.  I drink tea and coffee, and this toothpaste seems to remove that stains that typically come from those types of beverages.</li>
    <li> If you have veneers you know that even though they stay white they will stain some in between teech.&lt;br /&gt;I use this once a week to keep that from happening.</li>
    <li> so far very satisfied</li>
    <li> The only toothpaste I use! Leaves my teeth feeling so smooth and clean and white. Even after whitening does not create any sensitivity whatsoever. My teeth feel cleaner after using this toothpaste and any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Supersmile\\&quot; exceeded my expectations. I just spent a good deal of money on my teeth. I didn&#x27;t want them damaged again and I didn&#x27;t want a  dull,scratched looking smile. With \\&quot;Supersmile\\&quot; my teeth feel clean and look great. I would recommend it to anyone looking to present a great smile and protect their investment.  And the best part was that I was able to find and purchase it at a great deal on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this toothpaste for years.  Found it at my chemist shop in NYC. After a few months I went to my dentist for a whitening session.  She looked at my teeth and told me that they didn&#x27;t need whitening and what was I doing to keep them so white.  Well worth the money.  Last a long time because you don&#x27;t have to use much.</li>
    <li> Supersmile Whitening Toothpaste delivers on its promise  not only  to whiten teeth several shades, but to keep them white is the absolute truth.  I have used this toothpaste for 15 years, and I receive compliments on my teeth on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> This was an expensive experiment, that turned into a failure.  I am a wine/tea/coffee drinker and chronic blueberry smoothie consumer, so my teeth could use some lightening and brightening.  I used this toothpaste exclusively for the past 6 months (with a sonicare) and exactly as directed (with a dry toothbrush) and noticed no change whatsoever.  It functions as toothpaste, in that it cleaned my teeth, but they are definitely not any whiter than when I started.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement in my teeth.</li>
    <li> I really love supersmile toothpaste. I&#x27;ve used it for over 2 years now and wont change. i&#x27;m getting ready to order more now.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is okay but I didn&#x27;t use it very long. I didn&#x27;t like to texture (I know that&#x27;s a little weird).</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really seen results, but that&#x27;s hard to do when you&#x27;re checking daily!</li>
    <li> excellent tooth paste</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t imagine using anything else.  Using this for years. Best out there</li>
    <li> I am so sorry that I wasted my money on this product. My grandson, my husband and myself have all been using this product, along with the accelerator; however, they don&#x27;t work. All our teeth have remained the same. I have wasted so much money on various sites&lt;br /&gt;stocking up on Supersmile products, only for a big let down. Never, Ever Again.</li>
    <li> I want to believe! Haven&#x27;t seen much improvement after 5 weeks use as directed ... But everytime I use it I want to believe it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> best whiter I have tried... been looking so long to find something easy, tastes great, and actually works.... even my husband will use it lol : ) highly recommend</li>
    <li> I was kind of leary of the claims about this toothpaste when I first saw this product on the \\&quot;Joan Rivers Show\\&quot; (years ago) but I will tell you right now, this is the best toothpaste I have ever used &amp; you will love the way it makes your teeth feel when you use it! Nothing compares to it, not even a cleaning at the dentist office! It is so good &amp; this price is great so I am going to order 2 tubes right now so that I am stocked up!</li>
    <li> Great product if you have cosmetic dentistry.</li>
    <li> Leaves mouth feeling clean, whitening iffi!!!</li>
    <li> Little by little, the product is making my teeth whiter.  I just wish that it would product the results in less time.  For some reasons, I find it difficult to remember not to wet the brush before applying the paste.</li>
    <li> Love it! Will be buying again! Patience needed, as this doesn&#x27;t work overnight. But it does work!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth and can&#x27;t use a lot  of tooth pastes that contain whitening properties but have been using this one for 6 months and haven&#x27;t had any issues but a much whiter smile!</li>
    <li> I really like this toothpaste. It&#x27;s pricey but worth it for me.  Other whitening toothpastes irritate my gums, but this one does not. You only use a little bit of it, so it lasts as well or better than regular toothpaste. I like the taste also.  It has helped brighten my teeth and  also works on my veneers, which is why I bought it for a try in the first place.  I&#x27;ve used the strips and other toothpastes and this is the best product I&#x27;ve found to date.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste whitened my teeth several shades after I used it for a few months.  The ingredients seem to be very strong, so I try to mix up with other toothpastes.  It is also a good acne remedy if you mix it with a little neosporin : )</li>
    <li> I have been using supersmile for years. Once you try it you cant use anything else. Makes your mouth feel like you just had a cleaning at the dentist and whitens your teeth.</li>
    <li> been using this toothpaste for years. I won&#x27;t be without it. Makes my teeth feel clean and look whiter. Recommend!</li>
    <li> I use this toothpaste once a day for 2 weeks and my teeth are bright and shiny! However, I don&#x27;t feel like my teeth get very clean so I use regular toothpaste in the evenings to avoid cavities and plaque build up. I have bought this product before and I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> I brushed with Supersmile for 2 weeks and saw no difference in the brightness of my teeth.  By comparison, I recently purchased Sensodyne Pro-Enamel with Whitening.  It shows a difference with a much lower price.  I will not purchase Supersmile again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about a month, I use it twice a day. I was hoping it would make my teeth whiter. It did a little but I was expecting more. Perhaps it will take more than a month. I would try over the counter, less expensive before using this.</li>
    <li> Have ben using this for a couple weeks and there is a noticeable difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
    <li> We can that it is whitening our teeth, nothing drastic but it helps</li>
    <li> I noticed no difference in the whitening of my teeth and didn&#x27;t like the consistence of the paste. On the up side, it did no harm.</li>
    <li> Absolutely not worth it. The product did not whiten my teeth after almost 3 months of using it religiously. I followed the instructions step by step so I can honestly say it simply does as much or less than any regular whitening toothpaste. AVOID.</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste for whitening.</li>
    <li> I really like this tooth paste.</li>
    <li> Really like this whitening toothpaste and have used it for years.  It gives you immediate brightness, and the longer it&#x27;s used the brighter your smile becomes.  It&#x27;s a great product for at-home tooth whitening.</li>
    <li> This is a big waste of money.  just like other products out there, it does not work AT ALL.  Save your money.  Or try Himalayan brand whitening, it did more than any other kind i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> My teeth feel and look great after just a few days. Not just whiter, but Supersmile also removed (or mitigated) stains.</li>
    <li> fast shipping...great product</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste!  I am very pleased with it!  I have veneers and this is one of the few products that will help keep veneers white and help with coffee stains.</li>
    <li> Brush your teeth with this stuff regularyly and it will help whiten your teeth.  It won&#x27;t may your teeth pearly white but it definitely helps and is worth it.</li>
    <li> Works great!!!  This is the best product ever!!!  I absolutely love it!!!  I recommend it to all who want white teeth!</li>
    <li> As described. Prompt delivery. Thank you.</li>
    <li> It works, but the consistently of the product does take some getting used to. It sticks to your teeth even after your rinse, so don&#x27;t be too shocked!</li>
    <li> Did not seem to affect the color of my teeth after 2 months of dedicated using 3x per day with my sonicare toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I had developed staining on my teeth from prescription Peridex.  I had researched potential products to treat this.  I expected more from this product particularly considering the cost.  After one week of continuous use, I was disappointed.  I then purchased Colgate Optic white and achieved much better results.</li>
    <li> best toothpaste out there.  have been using it since the product first launched.</li>
    <li> Meh... Didn&#x27;t notice any results.</li>
    <li> i think this worked great</li>
    <li> I liked it but not sure it made that much of a difference in my teeth color! I liked how fresh my mouth felt after using it!</li>
    <li> tastes good and leaves teeth feeling so clean</li>
    <li> I really like this tooth paste. I would recommend it</li>
    <li> Remember to use a dry toothbrush.  I only use once/day at night and regular toothpaste in the AM.  No sensitivity!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this toothpaste for years.  It&#x27;s the best whitening toothpaste I&#x27;ve found. I don&#x27;t have any sensitivity from it either.</li>
    <li> I had used the Super Smile system since January. I HONESTLY see a big difference in the color of my teeth. I bought this to use ans an &#x27;upkeep&#x27;. Remember to use with a dry toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice an appreciable difference in my teeth.  They were not brighter and the stains are still there.  But again, maybe it is because I have years and years of stains.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years.  Although it is expensive, it is the only toothpaste I use.</li>
    <li> works very well with vaneers</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste.  I have used it for years because my dentist recommended it and because it really does work to maintain tooth whiteness.  You only need a small pea-sized amount and a dry toothbrush to use it effectively.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using supersmile for the last 4 or 5 years and will not use any other brand. I realize it&#x27;s quite expensive but I love the taste and the way my teeth look.I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Took a couple of weeks until I started to see a real whitening difference. Did not use the acuator (?) just the paste from the gitgo. Like it because it is not gloppy like most toothpastes; my teeth feel the cleanest they have every felt, not &amp;#34;sweaters&amp;#34; ever. I have mild periodontal disease and my gums seem much healthier looking too.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t explain it, Of all the toothpastes I&#x27;ve ever used my mouth feels amazingly clean when I use super smile.&lt;br /&gt;What am I comparing it against? Colgate, Toms, and Blanx.&lt;br /&gt;I used to be a blanx user, but they don&#x27;t distribute the artic moss blanx into the states anymore. I switched to supersmile and I wouldn&#x27;t look back if they did.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Clean mouth feel&lt;br /&gt;subtle mint flavor&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Price... It is very expensive. But if you want to feel like you love yourself, this is something worth trying. Go on indulge yourself. even for just one tube.</li>
    <li> remember use a dry tooth brush its perfect to maintain your whitened teeth twice a day no sesitivity&lt;br /&gt;i have sensitive teeth</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Makes my teeth smooth &amp; kept white used every day. This is my 3 order. If you use a pee size daily it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about six weeks.  I noticed some improvement after a couple of weeks, then stopped paying attention.  Then the other day, someone my age asked how I keep my teeth so white!  I looked closely again, and my teeth are uniformly white and stain free!  It is worth the extra cost, absolutely.</li>
    <li> o.k. but not really better that other whitening toothpaste</li>
    <li> Not noticing much difference for the money.</li>
    <li> Seems to work. Will have to update as I go.</li>
    <li> Worked to whiten my teeth slightly.  Still looking into professional whitening, but for a quick fix it seems to work fairly well.  I use a little of this with my regular toothpaste and together they seem to work great.  Using both separate doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as when you combine a regular toothpaste with this.</li>
    <li> There is a noticeable difference using this toothpaste. It really does whiten.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this for years.  My dentist recommended.  Arrived quickly as usual.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my mother who doesn&#x27;t order on line. She was very happy I was able to find this product for her. She was happy with the price.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this (and sold it at cost--$12), so I tried it. I think it helps whiten my teeth a little (I don&#x27;t use the companion whitening product), but not enough to justify the price. The real reason I keep using it is that it has eliminated plaque build-up between my lower front teeth. I flossed everyday, and I still used to get a yellowy build up between cleanings. No more! For that reason alone, I think it is worth 3 times the price of regular tooth paste.</li>
    <li> this was a good product and good value. The purchase came quickly and I would buy it again when needed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this didn&#x27;t work for me.  With all the positive reviews I was hopeful, but unfortunately it wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
