      <li>the smell is fresh too.  </li>
      <li>The 7.5oz size is just right.</li>
      <li>This is great hand soap and the only one we&#x27;ve found that actually smooths my husband&#x27;s hands</li>

      <li>do recommend this Dial Soap, really!</li>
      <li>When we use this soap consistently in the winter</li>
      <li>Not too much to say, however, I will confirm that this soap does feel nice on the hands after rinsing and does not leave it too dry.  </li>
      <li>Loved it for a little while...read about triclosan (the main ingredient) before you buy to see if you&#x27;re still interested.  </li>
      <li>Most soaps dry my hands out, but this soap helps to keep them moisturized</li>
      <li>Most soaps will dry my hands to the point where the skin is cracking and bleeds.</li>
      <li>The only reason I don&#x27;t give this 5 stars is that I wish the large jug was still available, rather than the 12 7.5 ounce bottles.  </li>
      <li>and I wash my hands a whole lot.  </li>
      <li>so I have to use gentle products.</li>
      <li>Keeps my hands in better shape than any other hand soap out there.</li>
      <li>I tend to wash my hands constantly because of having to wipe and clean after a toddler.</li>
      <li>Very standard, and nothing really special about it besides the price, antibacterial, and moisturizer.</li>
      <li>i highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>You might alternate with another soap to keep your scents fresh, though.</li>
      <li>Do not like the soft soaps, love this product because it cleans well and doesn&#x27;t have a heavy smell that haunts you like some soaps do.  </li>
      <li>moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Since dial has brought back the product in the. 7.5 oz pump, does anyone know how to purchase the large 90 oz refill?&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;Gerry in Wisconsin</li>
      <li>The only anti-bacterial soap that is gentle to my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I have to wash my hands a lot because I have a medically fragile daughter, so this really helps in keeping my hands moisturized.  </li>
      <li>I have a highly sensitive nose and my skin is sensitive as well.</li>
      <li>This Dial hand soap with moisturizer and aloe completely eliminates that problem.  </li>
      <li>I bought the soap because of all the other stellar reviews on it.</li>
      <li>Apparently they changed it and didn&#x27;t bother telling me.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately, none of our local stores are carrying this soap, so I am glad to find it here on Amazon!</li>
      <li>so I always need to have my hands clean because I get sick easy.</li>
      <li>I see it in stores again, so I looked at their website and apparently they brought it back.</li>
      <li>It is very difficult to find in stores because most people prefer the soaps that stink to high hell.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The bottle looks as good as on the website. It has a pleasant, mild scent while washing and after washing. I wash my hands many times a day, and it is not too drying. It rubs well during washing and rinses okay. Only a tiny bit is needed per use. The 7.5oz size is just right. I estimate it&#x27;ll take me 11 months to use up my 12 bottles.</li>
    <li> The only reason I don&#x27;t give this 5 stars is that I wish the large jug was still available, rather than the 12 7.5 ounce bottles.  This is great hand soap and the only one we&#x27;ve found that actually smooths my husband&#x27;s hands and they don&#x27;t get dry and rough from frequent handwashing.</li>
    <li> I have four kiddos, three who are currently in diapers and I wash my hands a whole lot.  Most soaps dry my hands out, but this soap helps to keep them moisturized and it smells great without an overwhelming scent (I have respiratory allergies and can&#x27;t handle most perfumes but this soap doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies at all).  Even my teenage nephew who hates to wash his hands will use this stuff.  Unfortunately, none of our local stores are carrying this soap, so I am glad to find it here on Amazon!</li>
    <li> This is a nice large pack of 12 handsoap bottles. I love the smell. The fact that its antibacterial as well as moisturizing just adds to the value of this soap.  Very standard, and nothing really special about it besides the price, antibacterial, and moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I bought the soap because of all the other stellar reviews on it. But I don&#x27;t find it to be the miracle worker that other people said it was. Although the soap isnt as drying as some of the other soaps we&#x27;ve used, it still leaves my winter hands cracking.</li>
    <li> This cleans my hands, and leaves them smelling great.  Also, I think in my head this moisturizes better than Dial Gold.  Had to order from Amazon because can&#x27;t find in stores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who washes their hands a hundred times a day. Not OCD but borderline I guess. I touch my face and eyes a lot so I always need to have my hands clean because I get sick easy. Most soaps will dry my hands to the point where the skin is cracking and bleeds. I like this soap a lot because it cleanses well and a little goes a long way. Keeps my hands in better shape than any other hand soap out there. Even better than those fufu high priced ones. Will never fall for the hype of those PHI-LIES-OPHY type soaps and gels again. What a waste of money those were! Good to know I can always come back to good old trusty dial. I grew up using fresh aloe for cuts, scrapes, and burns, so I know of it&#x27;s moisturizing and healing properties. Am glad Dial makes this with aloe. Definitely brought me back as a customer. Not only does it save me money on soap but also on moisturizer. I only have to put lotion on at bedtime unlike before where I had to every time after I washed. I hope they keep selling it because I will definitely be back for more.</li>
    <li> I use this plus some soft soap with lotion into working these together is a very good plan your hands will never dry out and always be Almost germ free!!</li>
    <li> like this soap a lot.  hit and miss finding it at the grocery store, so decided to get a bunch of it</li>
    <li> It smells great and it helps keep my hands soft.  I have to wash my hands a lot because I have a medically fragile daughter, so this really helps in keeping my hands moisturized.  doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands like some other hand soaps.  the smell is fresh too.  Would purchase over and over again</li>
    <li> These bottles of Dial Soap were given to the Ronald McDonald House as a donation to help them with all the families they host.  They loved them!</li>
    <li> I love the smell and it really washes my hands well. Plus the bulk pack ensures I stay stocked for a while.</li>
    <li> It is really nice for anyone with dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is really nice too.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this Dial Soap, really!</li>
    <li> The only anti-bacterial soap that is gentle to my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I always order this product by the box. It is very difficult to find in stores because most people prefer the soaps that stink to high hell.You&#x27;ll find this one to be non-offensive and very good at cleaning your hands.</li>
    <li> only hand soap we use</li>
    <li> Getting the bulk pack is great, I keep a supply in my bathroom and just replaces the bottles as needed. Good quality soap, cheap, and always have a bottle when I need it. Don&#x27;t have to worry about running out again.</li>
    <li> Nice scent. Convenient size.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hands from cracking in the winter, smells great and gets comments from my guests. You might alternate with another soap to keep your scents fresh, though.</li>
    <li> Not too much to say, however, I will confirm that this soap does feel nice on the hands after rinsing and does not leave it too dry.  I tend to wash my hands constantly because of having to wipe and clean after a toddler.</li>
    <li> Must have Dial with Aloe.  I looked all over but could not find it!</li>
    <li> Great soap, fair price.  Love getting things in bulk on Amazon.</li>
    <li> THIS WAS A REVIEW FOR THE ALOE HAND SOAP NOT THE SOOTHING CARE. Apparently they changed it and didn&#x27;t bother telling me.  I love the Aloe hand soap. I have a highly sensitive nose and my skin is sensitive as well. Also I have psoriasis so I have to use gentle products. This hand soap is wonderful for me.  And it smells great! I had a hard time finding it in stores so I contacted dial. They said the discontinued it (this was last year) so I had my husband buy me a case on amazon. I see it in stores again, so I looked at their website and apparently they brought it back. I am so excited as I said it is great for sensitive skin and the scent is pleasant and the soap is gentle enough for constant washing. I hope this helps anyone if they are unsure about this product.  THE SOOTHING CARE IS TERRIBLE. THE SCENT IS VERY STRONG. IT DRIED OUT MY HANDS AND IRRITATED THEM. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE SOOTHING CARE DIAL.</li>
    <li> I would like to purchase the large refill jug of this great antibacterial aloe soapworts moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Since dial has brought back the product in the. 7.5 oz pump, does anyone know how to purchase the large 90 oz refill?&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;Gerry in Wisconsin</li>
    <li> We were looking for an anti-bacterial hand soap. Dial was the perfect answer. It is gentle on the hands, and has a wonderful fragrance afterwards. Not overwhelming, just a clean great smell.</li>
    <li> The soap is a 5 star product, but one bottle had the spout popped up and leaked about half of its contents.  A mess!</li>
    <li> Smells nice and does not overdry your hands.</li>
    <li> This is the best household hand soap I have ever used.  It has a silky feel that is not too thick, not too thin and isn&#x27;t sticky.  The scent is pleasant, but very mild.  We use this soap all year around, but it is especially fantastic in the winter.  Other hand soaps we have used in the winter have left everyone in my family with dry/cracked hands.  This Dial hand soap with moisturizer and aloe completely eliminates that problem.  When we use this soap consistently in the winter no one in the family has a problem with dry/cracked hands.  It&#x27;s fantastic soap. I can&#x27;t think of any way that this product could be improved.</li>
    <li> Cleans and smells fine. Won&#x27;t dry out your skin. Easy to use. Comes in a pack of 12 which I think that is the best way to buy such a great product.</li>
    <li> this liquid hand soap is also anti bacterial. plus it has aloe vera to soften your hands and keep them from drying out. i highly recommend this product. happy shopping. aloha. haleiwa jon</li>
    <li> I love how smooth this soap feels.  I had bought another brand before this one, and will stick to this one from now on.  Feels better and its easier to pump out as well.</li>
    <li> Do not like the soft soaps, love this product because it cleans well and doesn&#x27;t have a heavy smell that haunts you like some soaps do.  However it&#x27;s hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> My wife loves how it makes her hands feel.</li>
    <li> Loved it for a little while...read about triclosan (the main ingredient) before you buy to see if you&#x27;re still interested.  I decided to go with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s hand soap as I felt it was just safer for me &amp; my family.</li>
    <li> Great scent --- not too strong. We use it daily in the kitchen and bathrooms. Great to have a stock pile on-hand so we never run out.</li>
