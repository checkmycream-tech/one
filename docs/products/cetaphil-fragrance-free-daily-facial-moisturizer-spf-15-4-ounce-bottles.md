### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best moisturizer!</li>
      <li>I am a Cetaphil cleanser fan and also thought this would be perfect.  </li>
      <li>so it is not an absolutely perfect product</li>
      <li>very good to ues for sunscreen</li>
      <li>It works great on some parts of my face</li>
      <li>skin looks great.</li>
      <li>love it!!</li>
      <li>Good balance.</li>
      <li>Good moisturizer, not greasy.</li>

      <li>And my skin has never felt so good.</li>
      <li>Love This Product!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Glad that i bought this here!</li>
      <li>AMAZING.  </li>
      <li>So, if you want to walk around with that kind of stink of your face all day then by all means, purchase this.</li>
      <li>it at your own expense, but this is my warning.</li>
      <li>but it still goes on nicely and lighter than most moisturizers with sunscreen.    </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hypoallergenic, best for kids and women with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Cetaphil is an okay moisturizer...</li>
      <li>I like the consistency of this lotion and think it does ok as a moisturizer</li>
      <li>My two teenage daughters have been using it for a year now and their skin looks flawless.</li>
      <li>Best to use with cetaphil facial cleanser.</li>
      <li>many things do that I have tried.</li>
      <li>I needed to wear it during the day and because it caused redness I tried to put makeup on top.</li>
      <li>Okay.  </li>
      <li>I know the label specifically states not to use around the eye, but I think most people who buy face lotion expect to apply liberally to the face.  </li>
      <li>I love</li>
      <li>truth is, I like it way more - and it&#x27;s 1/4 the cost.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t necessarily believe this is the BEST product</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I excepted more our of Cetaphil.</li>
      <li>Love this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Not to mention the fact that it made my oily skin even oilier (surprising, given that it does feel pretty light).</li>
      <li>very nice product, doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin,  my skin is extremely sensitive</li>
      <li>I have used other Cetaphil products before and was very happy with them.</li>
      <li>and then it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>I like it just fine, the skin gets velvety.</li>
      <li>This is important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>has stayed light with discoloration.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>Used this product daily for 6-8 years and works great.  </li>
      <li>I know it burns if you get it in the eyes, so I dab there lightly.</li>
      <li>I contacted the company and they gave me a full refund.  </li>
      <li>Finally, I found the moisturizer that works for me with a good sunblock in it.</li>
      <li>daily use, my skin is supple and provides a good foundation for a bit of concealer or powder.</li>
      <li>I used to get Dermarest because of mild rosacea but they trippled the price.</li>
      <li>I have dry skin - slightly fair and freckled.  </li>
      <li>But if I have more reactions I&#x27;ll stop using it completely.</li>
      <li>I kept trying to use this, convincing myself that because it is made by Cetaphil it will not bother my sensitive skin...</li>
      <li>However I wasn&#x27;t able to get that far because one night of trying this moisturizer first proved to be a \\&quot;miss\\&quot; with my skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a variety of their other products and have been very satisfied with them (ie.</li>
      <li>And around my mouth feels warm like the warmth of icy hot.</li>
      <li>This moisturizer is fragrance free and not heavy or oily....</li>
      <li>&quot; keeping my t-zone from being extra oily... while hoping to be able to find an acne solution on the side with oral medication or birth control.</li>
      <li>It also seems to have softened my skin a bit more than my last moisturizer, but not drastically.  </li>
      <li>Okay, I love the daily facial cleanser</li>
      <li>So far i liked this daily moisturizer, but i will love it only if they increased the SPF</li>
      <li>Every morning, after I brush my teeth, I always put 2 pumps worth in my palm, as a moisturizer, and I smooth it across my entire face.</li>
      <li>I do believe that keeping your face moisterized dramatically helps with appearance and along side with a good daily facial routine keeps zits at bay.</li>
      <li>really?</li>
      <li>Anyways, I expected more out of Cetaphil.  </li>
      <li>The smell is minimal and not over-perfumed like many products.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>One reviewer here mentions some ingredient that sensitive skin folk are most likely to have a reaction to/issue with...</li>
      <li>I am a fan of other Cetaphil products, and normally have to drive 30 minutes to get to a store that carries my other moisturizer, so I was happy to find this at a store nearby.  </li>
      <li>Most products leave your skin dry and red, whereas the Cetaphil line is very gentle.  </li>
      <li>I also have blackheads on my nose and chin, a lightly oily t-zone with dry cheeks/mouth area.</li>
      <li>I definitely feel like my skin can \\&quot;breathe\\&quot; better, which is a big plus.</li>
      <li>I still use the cleanser and would highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>eventually was referred to a dermatologist who recommends cetaphil cleanser, which is non comedogenic and gentle for my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer, SPF 15, Fragrance Free - 4 fl oz is a very moist, fragrant lotion.  </li>
      <li>I love the cleanser which has never made my skin better, but it is the only one that hasn&#x27;t made my skin worse.</li>
      <li>Burning, bright red, tight and itchy, I figured I could bare it until it settled like</li>
      <li>youre better off using a different moisturizer, don&#x27;t waste your money on this one... doesn&#x27;t moisturize AT ALL, and feels very greasy on the skin!</li>
      <li>On the one hand I find that it&#x27;s pretty light weight and sinks in to my skin after a short time.</li>
      <li>Holy grail moisturizer for my very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>After the first day I suddenly remember:  I have purchased this product before, years ago.  </li>
      <li>The first time she put it on it was stinging for only a minute.</li>
      <li>My skin is not too sensitive but this made my face(especially my eyes) feel like they were on fire!</li>
      <li>but, it also kept my skin smooth for the little time I used it.</li>
      <li>though I will personally never use this again, I&#x27;m giving it three stars because everything else about it is fine, and I think not everyone can taste the bitter taste.</li>
      <li>when I made the switch to cetaphil and subsequently other mild products for my skin, my face has cleared dramatically.</li>
      <li>A great alternative for expensive facial moisturizers.</li>
      <li>and i cant help but get it near my eyes and when it does it burns like ALL HELL just spit in my eyes.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and have never had that reaction from a product.  </li>
      <li>It stings my skin when applied (and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin), it smells of bug spray and by the end of the day it had somehow crept into my eyes, making them burn and water.</li>
      <li>At 23 years old, I have struggled with mild/moderate acne since about 12 years old.</li>
      <li>Not messy.</li>
      <li>she doesn&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Oh and to add a cherry on top, I have unknown allergies where some creams, detergents, dyes, fabrics and other things will result in swollen eyes and hives with itchy burning skin.</li>
      <li>This item works really well with my skin, which is pretty sensitive usually.</li>
      <li>#34;feel it&amp;#34; on my face, it has a low goo factor - which is important to me, because I wear foundation everyday as well.</li>
      <li>but just so you know there will still be an odor to the very sensitive individual.  </li>
      <li>Deeply Moisturizes And Leaves Skin Soft To The Touch,</li>
      <li>I know that everyone&#x27;s taste buds are different, and there are certain chemicals that taste very bitter to some people, but have no taste to others.  </li>

<li> I&#x27;ve used Cetaphil cleansers with no problem before, but this product is a huge disappointment.</li>
<li> I know I&#x27;m not the only person with the same complaint.  </li>
<li> But, alas, it feels sticky on my face when I put it on and in the morning it really feels sticky.  </li>
<li> I did not have any burning but the product feels heavy and you can feel it on your face for a short while after applying.</li>
<li> few days for the same reason I&#x27;m going to stop using it now:  </li>
<li> It has a smell akin to sunscreen if you&#x27;re curious.</li>
<li> Live in Minnesota where in the summer where it is very humid and other products are greasy and in the winter it is very cold and very dry  (especially in Jan/Feb)</li>
<li> This may be due to the sunscreen.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just me, but why would anyone create a face lotion that makes your eyeballs feel like they&#x27;ve been to the fiery Pits of Mordor and back?  </li>
<li> Cleansing bar, and other lotions and cremes).  </li>
<li> I switched from Eucerin because it was starting to feel a little heavy.  </li>
<li> Plus, it has AVOBENZONE 3%, which is one of the active ingredients to look for.</li>
<li> my regular cetaphil doesnt have SPF, but this stuff just sucks.  </li>
<li> I get the odd ones on my cheeks.</li>
<li> But I too have had a slight reaction to it.</li>
<li> Even when I purposefully avoid applying it within a half inch of my lips, I still manage to end up with that bitter taste in my mouth, usually after licking  my lips.  </li>
<li> It leaves a horrible taste in my mouth, for pretty much</li>
<li> I still get a little shine</li>
<li> It broke my face out with little bumps.</li>
<li> I guess I put the cream a little too close to my eyes.</li>
<li> Because it has the sunscreen there will be that whitish hue and feel a bit heavy</li>
<li> My powder brush doesn&#x27;t get gooped up and my pressed powder isn&#x27;t dark, hard or oily as a result.</li>
<li> if you rubbed your face raw with exfoliant, it tingles a bit but does not \\&quot;burn\\&quot;</li>
<li> and there&#x27;s very little to complain about.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had no problem like this with my usual moisturizer (a neutrogena product) which I apply liberally without concern, and</li>
<li> (On me at least.)</li>
<li> And I uses cold, wet cloths to sooth but it will continue to burn for HOURS!!!</li>
<li> Keeps face well-moisturized without irritating.</li>
<li> This is one of them.&lt;br /&gt;For years I have struggled for a solution, while never having the option for anything dramatic because my acne isn&#x27;t \\&quot;bad enough\\&quot; for extreme options.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Not sure why the moisturizer is so BAD.</li>
<li> Sorry I bought it.</li>
<li> It smells so bad I am nauseated.</li>
<li> A half hour after putting this on, keeping it well away from my lips, I get a horrible metallic taste in my mouth.</li>
<li> This product is expensive and feels like bad sunscreen.</li>
<li> This product stinks.</li>
<li> BAD idea, the minute I put it on my face it felt like acid was on it.  </li>
<li> HOWEVER it smells bad...</li>
<li> I need a moisturizer badly though because I had Dot Laser done 5 days ago.</li>
<li> I also have about 1 painful cystic zit every month.</li>
<li> however, I hate this moisturizer.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t tolerate this sickening smell!</li>
<li> It feels awful and stings.</li>

    <li> Cetaphil is an okay moisturizer...It works great on some parts of my face but i have oily forehead issues and sweat and i cant help but get it near my eyes and when it does it burns like ALL HELL just spit in my eyes. And I uses cold, wet cloths to sooth but it will continue to burn for HOURS!!! And around my mouth feels warm like the warmth of icy hot. It&#x27;s not for me, it&#x27;s actually caused my face to feel like chemical burns are on my face after every application of any other moisturizers. I don&#x27;t recommend, rather uses something else.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is fragrance free and not heavy or oily....love it!!</li>
    <li> Love This Product! Deeply Moisturizes And Leaves Skin Soft To The Touch, Not To Mention It Has SPF!</li>
    <li> So far i liked this daily moisturizer, but i will love it only if they increased the SPF</li>
    <li> very good to ues for sunscreen</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer! I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years. It is non-greasy and never irritates my skin.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and this will not clog your pores.    Because it has the sunscreen there will be that whitish hue and feel a bit heavy but it still goes on nicely and lighter than most moisturizers with sunscreen.    I still get a little shine so I blot my face later.    There is a \\&quot;pure\\&quot; smell to it as there is no fragrance but just so you know there will still be an odor to the very sensitive individual.  This may be due to the sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I am a Cetaphil cleanser fan and also thought this would be perfect.  But, alas, it feels sticky on my face when I put it on and in the morning it really feels sticky.  Sorry I bought it.</li>
    <li> I have used Cetaphil cleanser for years and years.  So I thought I would give the facial moisturizer and try. BAD idea, the minute I put it on my face it felt like acid was on it.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and have never had that reaction from a product.  I contacted the company and they gave me a full refund.  I still use the cleanser and would highly recommend it.  Not sure why the moisturizer is so BAD.</li>
    <li> Keeps face well-moisturized without irritating.</li>
    <li> I like the consistency of this lotion and think it does ok as a moisturizer HOWEVER it smells bad... sorta like bug spray. So, if you want to walk around with that kind of stink of your face all day then by all means, purchase this.</li>
    <li> Feels greasy and makes your face look like an oil stick. I got this in a sample trial package. I decided to give it a try and it makes my skin feel sticky and slimy. I didn&#x27;t get a reaction like some other people, but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone. I couldn&#x27;t wait to go home and wash this off my face. I have combination-oily skin</li>
    <li> This product is expensive and feels like bad sunscreen. I did not have any burning but the product feels heavy and you can feel it on your face for a short while after applying. I can not believe cetaphil made such a poor product and is still charging so much for it.</li>
    <li> Like to use a spf 15, facial moisturizer under my makeup. This Cetaphil moisturizer,does not give my skin a flakey look, when putting makeup over the product.</li>
    <li> youre better off using a different moisturizer, don&#x27;t waste your money on this one... doesn&#x27;t moisturize AT ALL, and feels very greasy on the skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Cetaphil cleansers with no problem before, but this product is a huge disappointment. It stings my skin when applied (and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin), it smells of bug spray and by the end of the day it had somehow crept into my eyes, making them burn and water. Not to mention the fact that it made my oily skin even oilier (surprising, given that it does feel pretty light). Would not recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this as my daily moisturizer.  I am a fan of other Cetaphil products, and normally have to drive 30 minutes to get to a store that carries my other moisturizer, so I was happy to find this at a store nearby.  After the first day I suddenly remember:  I have purchased this product before, years ago.  I stopped using it then after I few days for the same reason I&#x27;m going to stop using it now:  It leaves a horrible taste in my mouth, for pretty much the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know what you&#x27;re thinking:  &amp;#34;How the hell are you getting it in your mouth?&amp;#34;  My answer is: I DON&#x27;T KNOW.  Even when I purposefully avoid applying it within a half inch of my lips, I still manage to end up with that bitter taste in my mouth, usually after licking  my lips.  I&#x27;ve had no problem like this with my usual moisturizer (a neutrogena product) which I apply liberally without concern, and I know I&#x27;m not the only person with the same complaint.  I know that everyone&#x27;s taste buds are different, and there are certain chemicals that taste very bitter to some people, but have no taste to others.  I guess this must have one of those chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I will personally never use this again, I&#x27;m giving it three stars because everything else about it is fine, and I think not everyone can taste the bitter taste.</li>
    <li> A great alternative for expensive facial moisturizers. It&#x27;s hypoallergenic, best for kids and women with sensitive skin. You&#x27;ll see results overnight. My two teenage daughters have been using it for a year now and their skin looks flawless. Best to use with cetaphil facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> At 23 years old, I have struggled with mild/moderate acne since about 12 years old. I have the type of acne where I will have about 15 tiny colourless bumps all over my forehead, and some around the frame of my face. I get the odd ones on my cheeks.In time they eventually surface and are red and irritated. I also have about 1 painful cystic zit every month. I also have blackheads on my nose and chin, a lightly oily t-zone with dry cheeks/mouth area. Oh and to add a cherry on top, I have unknown allergies where some creams, detergents, dyes, fabrics and other things will result in swollen eyes and hives with itchy burning skin. This is one of them.&lt;br /&gt;For years I have struggled for a solution, while never having the option for anything dramatic because my acne isn&#x27;t \\&quot;bad enough\\&quot; for extreme options.&lt;br /&gt;I eventually was referred to a dermatologist who recommends cetaphil cleanser, which is non comedogenic and gentle for my sensitive skin. I love the cleanser which has never made my skin better, but it is the only one that hasn&#x27;t made my skin worse. I figured that the moisturizer would do the same, allowing sun protection for my skin and some extra hydration where needed with the \\&quot;oil free\\&quot; keeping my t-zone from being extra oily... while hoping to be able to find an acne solution on the side with oral medication or birth control. However I wasn&#x27;t able to get that far because one night of trying this moisturizer first proved to be a \\&quot;miss\\&quot; with my skin. Burning, bright red, tight and itchy, I figured I could bare it until it settled like many things do that I have tried. However it never really stopped and to my delight, the next morning I had hives and a swollen face. Stupid me, I always give things a second chance just to be sure it wasn&#x27;t one of my other allergies acting up. So 2 weeks later I tried again. I needed to wear it during the day and because it caused redness I tried to put makeup on top. The sticky moisturizer ended up \\&quot;peeling off\\&quot; as I would rub onfoundation, and looked like I had lint all over my face. So I washed it off and tried instead at night again, and same thing the next morning. Hives and swollen face, after the burning, itching, redness, etc. Don&#x27;t even get me started on what happens if you get it in your eyes... really? If it burns and itches you are bound to touch your face, and it is only a matter of time before you accidentally get dust or something in your eyes, or rub your eyes in the morning when you get up.&lt;br /&gt;Try it at your own expense, but this is my warning.</li>
    <li> Okay.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just me, but why would anyone create a face lotion that makes your eyeballs feel like they&#x27;ve been to the fiery Pits of Mordor and back?  I know the label specifically states not to use around the eye, but I think most people who buy face lotion expect to apply liberally to the face.  Anyways, I expected more out of Cetaphil.  I&#x27;ve tried a variety of their other products and have been very satisfied with them (ie. Cleansing bar, and other lotions and cremes).  But this bottle of Mount Doom Lava, I cannot recommend.</li>
    <li> I have to give this product 3 stars overall. I switched from Eucerin because it was starting to feel a little heavy.  I&#x27;ve been using Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer SPF 15 twice a day for about a week now with mixed results. On the one hand I find that it&#x27;s pretty light weight and sinks in to my skin after a short time. I definitely feel like my skin can \\&quot;breathe\\&quot; better, which is a big plus. It also seems to have softened my skin a bit more than my last moisturizer, but not drastically.  But I too have had a slight reaction to it. A few times I&#x27;ve had a reaction where my skin feels hot and turns a little reddish. It only lasts for about a minute and then it&#x27;s fine. Sometimes I have no reaction at all, which is why I haven&#x27;t discontinued it all together. But if I have more reactions I&#x27;ll stop using it completely.</li>
    <li> Holy grail moisturizer for my very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love this - Cetaphil gifted it to me with another purchase, and I only started using it when I ran out of my expensive face lotion...&lt;br /&gt;the truth is, I like it way more - and it&#x27;s 1/4 the cost.  I have dry skin - slightly fair and freckled.  I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;feel it&amp;#34; on my face, it has a low goo factor - which is important to me, because I wear foundation everyday as well. It wears well under my foundation, and I like not feeling cake or greasy.  Good balance.</li>
    <li> A half hour after putting this on, keeping it well away from my lips, I get a horrible metallic taste in my mouth.</li>
    <li> Okay, I love the daily facial cleanser however, I hate this moisturizer. It broke my face out with little bumps. It also made my face itchy but, it also kept my skin smooth for the little time I used it.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer, not greasy.</li>
    <li> Every morning, after I brush my teeth, I always put 2 pumps worth in my palm, as a moisturizer, and I smooth it across my entire face. I pledged, at the start of the spring, that I would do this every single day. I put make-up over it, (sometimes blush only, or powder and blush, sometimes nothing etc) and there are no undesirable effects. My powder brush doesn&#x27;t get gooped up and my pressed powder isn&#x27;t dark, hard or oily as a result. This is important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we&#x27;re into August and I have had no sunburns and my skin has stayed light with discoloration. If I am out on the water for extended periods I put something heavier on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks great. It looks as though it&#x27;s been well-protected and I have no problems with blemishes or reactions. Finally, I found the moisturizer that works for me with a good sunblock in it. Plus, it has AVOBENZONE 3%, which is one of the active ingredients to look for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product several times and every time I get repulsed by the odor.  I&#x27;m going to stick to [[ASIN:B001JJIRVA Kirkland Signature by Borghese Age-Defying Protective Moisture Lotion SPF 15 (3.4 fl oz)]]</li>
    <li> very nice product, doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin,  my skin is extremely sensitive</li>
    <li> I wish I had read these reviews before buying this product. This product stinks. It smells so bad I am nauseated. I need a moisturizer badly though because I had Dot Laser done 5 days ago. My eyes are bothering me a bit. They are burning. I guess I put the cream a little too close to my eyes. I plan to go to the store pronto and buy something else. I can&#x27;t tolerate this sickening smell! Gross.</li>
    <li> If you remember to moisturize daily, the product works. The smell is minimal and not over-perfumed like many products. It has a smell akin to sunscreen if you&#x27;re curious. It does make my eyes water if it is accidentally applied too closely to my eyes and if you rubbed your face raw with exfoliant, it tingles a bit but does not \\&quot;burn\\&quot; as someone else has suggested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With daily use, my skin is supple and provides a good foundation for a bit of concealer or powder. Having acne growing up, I tried a lot of products to no avail. Most products leave your skin dry and red, whereas the Cetaphil line is very gentle.  when I made the switch to cetaphil and subsequently other mild products for my skin, my face has cleared dramatically. I do believe that keeping your face moisterized dramatically helps with appearance and along side with a good daily facial routine keeps zits at bay. I don&#x27;t necessarily believe this is the BEST product but it won&#x27;t break the bank and there&#x27;s very little to complain about.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth. Not greasy. Not messy. I really like it.</li>
    <li> A good product with spf 15</li>
    <li> I kept trying to use this, convincing myself that because it is made by Cetaphil it will not bother my sensitive skin... but it ALWAYS did! One reviewer here mentions some ingredient that sensitive skin folk are most likely to have a reaction to/issue with... this must be the culprit.  I tried to use it b/c my regular cetaphil doesnt have SPF, but this stuff just sucks.  It feels awful and stings. (On me at least.)</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter to use on her face and she likes it she doesn&#x27;t have sensitive skin so it doesn&#x27;t bother her. The first time she put it on it was stinging for only a minute. Then after that, you get used to it!</li>
    <li> arrived to me expired stuff  !!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. After years of using Day creams &amp; Night creams and then a sunblock. I now just use Cetaphil Facial facial Moisturiser 15 And my skin has never felt so good.</li>
    <li> I have used other Cetaphil products before and was very happy with them. My skin is not too sensitive but this made my face(especially my eyes) feel like they were on fire! I excepted more our of Cetaphil.</li>
    <li> Used this product daily for 6-8 years and works great.  Not at all greasy.  Live in Minnesota where in the summer where it is very humid and other products are greasy and in the winter it is very cold and very dry  (especially in Jan/Feb) and I sometimes have to use it twice daily (only reason I gave it 4 stars vs. 5 stars so it is not an absolutely perfect product and maybe there is no such thing??? so may deserves 5 starts).  The SPF-15 is a plus but not why I use it but does make a difference when in the sun.</li>
    <li> I used to get Dermarest because of mild rosacea but they trippled the price. So I went to try Cetaphila as I&#x27;m already using the cleansers. I like it just fine, the skin gets velvety. I know it burns if you get it in the eyes, so I dab there lightly. Any product that has SPF anything will burn.</li>
    <li> AMAZING.  Nontoxic.  Doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes.  Love this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer, SPF 15, Fragrance Free - 4 fl oz is a very moist, fragrant lotion.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Glad that i bought this here! This item works really well with my skin, which is pretty sensitive usually. Thanks. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This burns your eyes !!</li>
