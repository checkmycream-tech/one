      <li>The best thing about the CCR2 clean &amp; charge refills isn&#x27;t the product itself but the product that it&#x27;s used with.</li>

      <li>Amazing.</li>
      <li>Also, I signed up for the subscription to get it shipped for free, and am so happy with not having to worry about buying it.</li>
      <li>I also own a Norelco Quadra electric shaver and it works well also</li>
      <li>Now, the razor seems to catch a good deal of the shaved whiskers, but many fall onto the sink or floor.  </li>
      <li>Use at your own risk.</li>
      <li>fill the cartridge with some warm water.</li>
      <li>These cartridges are great for maintaining a healthy machine and they are sold by many vendors.</li>
      <li>you make you own .</li>
      <li>Was just refills, but shipped fast and arrived perfect</li>
      <li>Product works great, I need it to clean my Braun Shaver.  </li>
      <li>Great pricing on the \\&quot;auto-ship\\&quot; option for this, hopefully I picked the correct term, 2-pack every 6 months, I clean it every time and do that twice a week.</li>
      <li>When I factor in the convenience of the electric razor and benefits of keeping it clean, this seems like a great product for me.</li>
      <li>Clean and charge refills are great.  </li>
      <li>This system of keeping shaver clean &amp; lubricated is great.</li>
      <li>Happy with replacement Clean and renew.  </li>
      <li>The solution was easy to install, has a nice odor, and does a good job cleaning the shaver.    </li>
      <li>The new Braun shaver, which I&#x27;ve reviewed also, is an excellent device, and the shave is quite comparable to a blade.</li>
      <li>, these things are very easy to spill when installing.  </li>
      <li>Very easy to use refills.  </li>
      <li>love having a clean razor when I shave and these Braun cleaners work great.</li>
      <li>It would be nice if there was more of a cycle</li>
      <li>Great product, easy to install and is cheap.  </li>
      <li>I make my own aftershave lotion by mixing rubbing alcohol + baby oil + water, mostly alcohol (17 parts), oil (3 parts), water (1 part), more oil if you want your skin to be softer, but it will shine.</li>
      <li>All in all, I&#x27;m always happy with the consistent performance with this product.  </li>
      <li>and I am delighted to finally be able to clean my razor again.</li>
      <li>It was great being able to go to Amazon and find exactly what I needed and order it.  </li>
      <li>price was good and service was quick.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to make it on your own</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased many replacement refill cartridges over that time.  </li>
      <li>I have read the reviews of these replacement cartridges for a razor that, in my opinion, shaves better than a blade and the biggest gripe seemed to be the cost.  </li>
      <li>This razor can be used without the &amp;quot;clean and charge&amp;quot; system but everyone seems to love that feature and wouldn&#x27;t want to give it up.  </li>
      <li>They are not the most reliable delivery service but sometimes all one can afford.</li>
      <li>so I am glad Amazon stocks it.</li>
      <li>OK, so are you one of those people who would just rather not spend any time cleaning your electric razor?  </li>
      <li>Every morning when I finish shaving, I just put the shaver in the attachment, and it does its magic.</li>
      <li>I have had my Syncro Shaver System for about a year now and love it.  </li>
      <li>I have owned a Braun 8595 shaving system for about a year and am well pleased with its performance and value.  </li>
      <li>Anything more than</li>
      <li>What more can I say?  </li>
      <li>This was the best price I could find at the time of purchase, but I recommend you shop around, including locally.  </li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t much more to say.</li>
      <li>I love the lemon scent.  </li>
      <li>Totally satisfied with product.</li>
      <li>with better results.  </li>
      <li>My husband is pleased with the refills -- they work well.</li>
      <li>I love getting them from Amazon because they are cheaper</li>
      <li>Do this by taking the cartridge out of the cleaning station and then look through the holes on the top of the cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
      <li>Place the cleaned and refilled cleaning cartridge in to the cleaning station and start using and enjoying the savings.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My husband asked for a better quality electric shaver.  </li>
      <li>This is more convenient.</li>
      <li>also has a interesting smell (fruit and loops).</li>
      <li>Seems to work OK.</li>
      <li>This product met my expectations however I should have purchased a four or more pack.</li>
      <li>Replacing the razor head every 18 months also helps keep razor performance top notch.</li>
      <li>It cleans, lubricates and makes your shave experience much better.</li>
      <li>I am sure I am getting better shaves and longer life out the shaver because of it.  ...</li>
      <li>I have used a Braun razor for many years and sometimes cannot find the cleaner</li>
      <li>My life is so much better from using Braun shavers and this Braun cleaner.  </li>
      <li>They are a better buy here than at wallmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>for sure purchase again.</li>
      <li>This stuff keeps my electric razor nice and clean.  </li>
      <li>Keeps my shaver clean and also maintains the foil blades quite nicely.</li>
      <li>I use this over and over since I clean my shaver before I run it through the cleaner for the nice smell and oil they put in it to keep the razor head sharpened.</li>
      <li>After using Norelco for 30+ years I switched to Braun mainly because of the cleaning system and am happy with the change.</li>
      <li>I wish these things did not smell like lemon dish soap, but they do keep my razor very clean.</li>
      <li>They already comand a pretty good price for the razor.  </li>
      <li>The cartridges were received promptly, in good condition and work exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>I love my Syncro Shaver and these refills are easy to install.</li>
      <li>amazing price and arrived quick.</li>
      <li>wish you many more close, clean,and comfortable shaves using your Braun Syncro Shaver System.</li>
      <li>good for large cooler</li>
      <li>I am, and since I started using the Braun Clean and Renew refills, I have learned  how easy cleaning a razor could be!  </li>
      <li>Hopefully I will get 2 or 3 more weeks from it since the \\&quot;Half\\&quot; light hasn&#x27;t come on yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Braun 7526 shaver and cleaning stand for 5+ years, and have found it to be the best balance of close shave with minimal irritation.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been doing this for 3 years and have not seen any damage to the shaver, the cardle, or most importantly to my skin.</li>
      <li>So glad to have these available through Amazon.com.  </li>
      <li>Nevertheless I keep using it because it really does do a good cleaning and lube job on the shaver.</li>
      <li>Does it really matter if your shaver smells good?</li>
      <li>Does what its supposed to with that nice lemony fresh scent.</li>
      <li>I really like my Braun shaver and these cleaning cartridges are easy to install and keep the shaver in good shape.</li>
      <li>I suppose the problem here is that this solution isn&#x27;t the most environmentally friendly stuff ever...</li>
      <li>After a good cleaning cycle, the razor works like it&#x27;s brand new!  </li>
      <li>Easy to install, and they do the job.</li>
      <li>I must have thrown away 20-30 containers which could easily be washed out and refilled with the cleaner.  </li>
      <li>I love these clean and renew cartridges.</li>
      <li>, you have to clean the razors and these cartridges are what most require in some form.</li>
      <li>it was easy to find refills for my braun ccr2 syncro shaver at amazon.com.</li>
      <li>love Braun Clean &amp; Renew merchandise product</li>
      <li>easy item to use</li>
      <li>the clean &amp; shave system saves me time, but costs more.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to install</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s easy to throw out.  </li>
      <li>I just think Braun did us all a great service in being innovative and constantly improving its products.  </li>
      <li>It makes my shaving easy</li>
      <li>something produced by braun for their machines, should work, dont wash your razors with water, the washing stand takes more time to clean it</li>
      <li>Easy to deal with</li>
      <li>and it is much quicker and more effective.  </li>
      <li>The good news is that since these cleaning refill cartridges are made by the manufacturer, they are an exact fit, and they work just the way the original cartridge does.  </li>
      <li>Make your shaver as good a a brand new ones each time.</li>
      <li>New origional Braun cleaning solution at a good price.  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s fine for me to wait 3-5 days between cleanings.  </li>
      <li>The order was handled and shipped fine.</li>
      <li>the refills that are available make cleaning so easy.  </li>
      <li>This Cleaning system was designed to preserve the micro fine \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; on the razor&#x27;s blades.</li>
      <li>The home made solution worked fine.</li>
      <li>I guess I should have read the fine print on the listing.</li>
      <li>They work fine of course, but your shaver will smell like you cleaned it with Pledge.</li>
      <li>It works just fine.</li>
      <li>The packaging also was fine since the liquid should not be under pressure.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My husband says they work fine and cost about $0.25 per refill.  </li>
      <li>The order was handled and shipped fine.</li>
      <li>They worked just fine.</li>
      <li>They fit cleaning unit and work fine</li>
      <li>These work fine, but after these ran out, I started making my own with straight rubbing alcohol.  </li>
      <li>All 4 could have easily fit into just one of these boxes.</li>
      <li>and I enjoy the shaving results after using the cartridge.</li>
      <li>They have a lemon-alcohol kind of scent to them which I have grown to really like.</li>
      <li>I have found that the green rubbing alcohol works great!  </li>
      <li>I have had quite a few Braun electric shavers over the years, and this one is the best.  </li>
      <li>Free usage.</li>
      <li>but when it&#x27;s at your door two days after ordering for free.</li>
      <li>Sure, it is a bit pricey, but worth the money if you value your time.</li>
      <li>The refills are not ultra cheap but neither is the razor.  </li>
      <li>Is there any sense in buying a razor which is cleanable if you&#x27;re going to cheap out on the cleaner?  </li>
      <li>You wouldn&#x27;t put cheap tires on a race car</li>
      <li>This razor makes my husband face smooth and fabulous.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a hunk of plastic filled with alcohol and a touch of fragrance.  </li>
      <li>They should be available this way for some persons.</li>
      <li>The thing&#x27;s got alcohol to clean and disinfect (for the face that is important) and lubricant which makes the blades strong longer.  </li>
      <li>seem to be original Worked fine</li>
      <li>Better fit and do the job right.</li>
      <li>like the other braun products this is also very good quality and durable.</li>
      <li>Also only use auto clean once or twice a week, this system works great for me.</li>
      <li>They totally take away the hassle of having to fix and clean your shaver and they do a great job at it.</li>
      <li>Much as I enjoyed the thorough cleaning and fresh lemon scent, don&#x27;t believe the hype about \\&quot;special cleaning agents\\&quot; and \\&quot;blade lubricants\\&quot;; these cartridges don&#x27;t contain either.  </li>
      <li>A cheap solution to keep the blade clean for every shave</li>
      <li>I received the Braun clean and renew packet with no base.  </li>
      <li>The Clean &amp; Renew cartridges help keep my shaver smooth running and lubricated.  </li>
      <li>No other price is fair.</li>
      <li>The Clean &amp; Renew System is a very useful feature, and these refills are required to use it.  </li>
      <li>We weren&#x27;t able to find the refills in the store and this was so easy and fast.  </li>
      <li>I am pleased that this does exactly what it is supposed to do...and my shaver is always in tip-top condition being cleaned with this solution automatically.  </li>
      <li>Between cleans, remove the cartridge from the cleaning machine and reseal the cartridge with the original plastic tab.  </li>
      <li>There shoud be a way to obtain the fluid in bulk at a much reduced price would make the product much more attractive.  </li>
      <li>Factory replacement for the original cleaning solution.</li>
      <li>Based on the pictures on Amazon&#x27;s web site, I was expecting to receive an unboxed item, but the refills were in its original retail packaging.  </li>
      <li>Once a week, remove head and rinse it and top of shaver under hot water.  </li>
      <li>This product works as well with my shaver system as did the original.  </li>
      <li>Works very good wish it was less cheaper</li>
      <li>Product is original manufacturer&#x27;s replacement for Braun Clean &amp; Renew Electric</li>
      <li>He liked it so well, he asked for a new one this Xmas.</li>
      <li>You can still clean it with the brush if you like...</li>
      <li>It does what it is sold to do-keep your razor clean.  </li>
      <li>Keeps your electric razor clean and lubricated.</li>
      <li>I also use the brush that came with my razor and clean off anything I can before putting it in for a cleaning.  </li>
      <li>the auto clean do</li>
      <li>This product is used to clean and lubricate your Braun electric razors.</li>
      <li>Besides cleaning your shaver it also lubricates your shaver&#x27;s mechanical parts after each clean, which extend the life of your shaver&#x27;s blade.</li>
      <li>Although it stated that you have to clean it after every shaves.</li>
      <li>the Braun system, you need to purchase the Clean &amp; Renew refills and change them about every 2 months.</li>
      <li>Without this cleaning solution for your Braun 85xx series shaver you&#x27;ll have to clean it by hand with the brush.</li>

      <li>It is nice to start fresh with new clean solution.</li>
      <li>Great price and item as expected</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;d really like to see more thought put into this (</li>
      <li>good enough for 6 months.</li>
      <li>Braun Clean &amp; Renew Refills seem adequate in performance.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think its worth the money - these things aren&#x27;t cheap and,</li>
      <li>The polish remover is good at removing the oils left on the cutter/foil, and the non-drying formula leaves a trace of oily ingredient that seems to help lube the shaver as well.</li>
      <li>have used one for a full year already.</li>
      <li>After 45 days or so, the fluid started to darken and by about 60 days, it was too full of debris to continue to use in good conscience.  </li>
      <li>You have to decide if $5/month is worth your time and effort to clean your shaver (even once a week) plus knowing that the cleaning solution has removed the oil and bacteria off the head and foil to minimize infection or in-grown wiskers.</li>
      <li>That way the bits of hair come out and the fresh alcohol rinses the filter clean.  </li>
      <li>It also leaves a fresh &amp; clean smell.</li>
      <li>The shaver stays clean and fresh.  </li>
      <li>Keeps your shaver clean and fresh.  </li>
      <li>It provides a fresh and clean shave every morning.</li>
      <li>All arrived quickly with each in a separate oversized box.</li>
      <li>though they go quick.  </li>
      <li>that next shave feels so good and smells fresh.  </li>
      <li>and they come quickly.</li>
      <li>Need to clean every week for best shaving, so they don&#x27;t last long.  </li>
      <li>It pays to purchase these refill cartridges for this great Electric Razor rather then the original and save a few dollars.</li>
      <li>There is no noticeable difference if you clean the shaver more frequently.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think husband could live without it now.  :-)</li>
      <li>Glad I found the subscribe and save option; now new ones are always on the way just in time.</li>
      <li>Below is the Easy Eight Step System to saving money you need to look inside the cartridge to see how much dirt, grease, and hair is in there.  </li>
      <li>This system is perfect for lazy people, and it does get the shaver much cleaner then running it under water.</li>
      <li>The next morning the shaver is ready for use again, and there&#x27;s a pleasant lemony smell to it, which I like.</li>
      <li>Does a great job but a little expensive-probably the container.</li>
      <li>It was used a lot since he has a heavy beard and he traveled a great deal.</li>
      <li>Great product all round.</li>
      <li>If it uses the Intense setting, it will use the liquid more and will probably have a greater tendency to last for a shorter period of time.  </li>
      <li>Or, buy the Braun Refills if you think the lemon fragrance is worth $10 a month...</li>
      <li>They are reasonably priced and last a good amount of time.</li>
      <li>but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>rather disappointingly, I&#x27;m not a millionaire, so</li>
      <li>Amazon offers a much better price.  </li>
      <li>So convenient, worth it.</li>
      <li>It leaves it lemony fresh.</li>
      <li>Nice that it was the same price as in store without the hassle of having to go into a store!</li>
      <li>Make the blades cut smoother, and smell fresh.</li>
      <li>.. now it makes everything so useful</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>I know it&#x27;s about $10 per 2 to 2 and 1/2 months, but it is worth it.  </li>
      <li>THE PHILADELPHIA EAGLES ARE ALL A DIS TASTE FULL ORGANIZATION OF STREET THUG MENTALITITY TO CONDONE THE SOCIAL BEHAVIOR OF WATCHING, PROMOTING, ENJOYING AND ENCOURAGING</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing how much bacteria-attracting goop can collect in an electric razor, even if you brush it clean daily.  </li>
      <li>As some other reviewers have suggested, this is possibly the world&#x27;s greatest shaver system.  </li>
      <li>By removing most of the debris, the fluid stays clean for 3 months.  </li>
      <li>this is a simple refill, easy in and easy out.</li>
      <li>This fluid sure works wonders with the clean n charge machine.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend these to anyone that could use them and the price was right.</li>
      <li>, I had to purchase it right on the spot.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>and it comes right to your door.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>These things are very pricey; if you clean every day, and if a cartridge lasts about 30 cleanings, you&#x27;ll spend about $60 per year.  </li>
      <li>It is a very convenient way to clean and lubricate the shaving head.</li>
      <li>Between my brush cleaning and use of the cleaning system after every use of the razor, my razor is always clean and ready.</li>
      <li>I wash thoroughly with water after every use, and do an economic clean once or maybe twice a week.</li>
      <li>the refills last about a month and are very easy to replace.  </li>
      <li>I own a Braun Series 7 and use the Clean &amp; Renew feature every other time I shave.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth a few bucks a month to keep it in the best condition possible.</li>
      <li>having the &#x27;new shaver&#x27; feel every day isn&#x27;t justified.</li>
      <li>They make the shaver feel new each time I use it, and there is a light lemon scent that helps invigorate me each morning.    </li>
      <li>He really likes the razor -- very much!</li>
      <li>Very fast service.</li>
      <li>When the indicator light on the cradle shows low fluid level, top the cartridge off with rubbing alcohol - 70% isopropyl - readily available at every pharmacy.  </li>
      <li>They keep your razor extremly clean which keeps the cutting blades at their best.  </li>
      <li>Better than going to local Target which doesn&#x27;t carry them anymore anyway.</li>
      <li>I would rather pay the same price for something representing a higher order of thought even if the solution and materials cost me more than this plastic-packaged monstrosity.</li>
      <li>Thanks Braun!</li>
      <li>These refills do exactly what they are supposed to do, as you can read in the product description.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is a necessary item that would be better off at a lower price.</li>
      <li>First is the cost.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise, if you just leave the top open it will evaporate in a month whether you use it or not.</li>
      <li>But that&#x27;s all a bit too much effort for me...!</li>
      <li>I got the first generation Syncro shaver cleaning systems when they first came out.</li>
      <li>The second generation systems are intelligent enough to automatically decide how intense a cleanning session your shaver needs.</li>
      <li>After cleaning-- the razor smells and operates like the first time I took it out of the box.  </li>
      <li>On trips ,I just wash the shaver head out with water but the cleaning cartridge is better for the shaver in daily use.</li>
      <li>most of the annoyance of owning an electric razor is cleaning it, but this takes the work of cleaning and makes it a simple task.  </li>
      <li>It is exactly as described in the product description.</li>
      <li>At 5 bucks or more a cartridge that last a matter of a couple of weeks</li>
      <li>The alcohol in the fluid removes most of the tap water preventing corrosion of the shaver.</li>
      <li>These are the first cartridges I&#x27;ve purchased in months.</li>
      <li>Third one over many years.</li>
      <li>Still on my first cartridge.</li>
      <li>You can go online and make your own cleaning solution using an empty Braun cleaning solution cartridge.</li>
      <li>It really begs the question of how people on Catalina Island keep their electric razors hygienic!?</li>
      <li>As for the \\&quot;advice\\&quot; of do-it-yourself adding alcohol, if you&#x27;re gonna do that, why buy this \\&quot;system\\&quot; in the first place?  </li>
      <li>, why not just buy any generic electric shaver and just throw the blade and netting into a cup with the alcohol to save more money??  </li>
      <li>Some people refill these, to me there is nothing like the fresh lemon scent these real braun cartridges.  </li>
      <li>Produce exactly as promoted.</li>
      <li>Several purchases ,the product has kept my Braun razor in tip top shape price &#x3D; value</li>
      <li>Product seems to be an exact replacement for my shaver.</li>
      <li>I find the braun shaver I bought to be quite good if I shave everyday rather than let my beard grow and cleanup is easier with this system.</li>
      <li>Anyhow, I&#x27;m all for saving money and finding a good substitute for trivial expenses such as this, but you&#x27;ll miss the \\&quot;lubricant\\&quot; ingredient and the other fine Braun contents.  </li>
      <li>I know lots love the conventional blade from Gillette or Schick, but electric razors are so convenient and easy and fast, I just save minutes using the electric shaver.  </li>
      <li>The shaver head remains sharp for greater than the recommend replacement period of 18 months, undoubtedly facilitated by the clean and renew solution.</li>
      <li>the cartridge if completely full of hair and dirt, most likely you will have no option but to purchase a new cartridge.</li>
      <li>I originally doubted that bathing my razor in a special fluid would help at all, but it really works!</li>
      <li>Also, my razor unit indicates that an \\&quot;Eco\\&quot; clean is needed after one shave, so I only clean the razor every two shaves.  </li>
      <li>thank you very much it helped me very much and fast safe delivery will definitly use this again especially when i have to refill</li>
      <li>If you have a Braun Electric Razor with Cleaning Station, these are a must to keep it clean and fully charged with no trouble.</li>
      <li>Also, I do enjoy the fresh lime smell of the fluid used in the process.  </li>
      <li>With the subscribe and save discount, I am pleased with these, even though I am not completely convinced they do a thorough cleaning.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s pretty straight forward.  </li>
      <li>I would be far more satisfied cleaning out the old one and refilling it with new solution from a simple canister.</li>
      <li>Braun ought to offer refills for the plastic fluid containers and design them to be easily cleaned and refilled.</li>
      <li>If Braun would get smart and sell a refill kit which came with a quart or two of solution and replacement filters, I&#x27;d buy that.  </li>
      <li>Smart idea for Braun to make a product that will keep bringing money in until the product breaks.</li>
      <li>Do this until you are satisfied with the level of cleanliness or conclude only a new replacement cartridge in needed.</li>
      <li>There is not much about this refill product you can say much except that it does keep your Braun nice &amp; clean and ready for the next run.</li>
      <li>In any event, regardless of the actual congestion of the foil razor after shave, these cleaning cartridges do a fine job a rinsing them away.  </li>
      <li>The refills are a little pricey and I have found that alcohol works as well - without the nice smell however.</li>
      <li>was several years ago when I first saw the &lt;b&gt;Braun 7525 Syncro Shaver System with Clean &amp; Charge Refills&lt;/b&gt;</li>
      <li>All in all, a very easy and simple way to keep your blades clean and sharp, and ready to use whenever the beard calls.</li>
      <li>Then turn the cartridge upside right and let sit for a day or two until full dry on the inside&lt;BR&gt;, Fill the dry cleaning cartridge with Isopropyl alcohol between ¨ø and ¨ú up to the top.</li>
      <li>Product came fast, works as advertised.</li>
      <li>So my hats off to Amazon for reading the comments here and making the shipping reasonable.  </li>
      <li>I hope they can keep prices low and shipping free with this inefficiency.</li>
      <li>It has a reasonable cartridge life</li>
      <li>These really work too.</li>
      <li>A very convenient method of cleaning.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m much happier now with my Norelco razor.</li>
      <li>but they evaporate kinda fast.</li>
      <li>(you get used to is fast) &lt;br</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t feel like cleaning my razor after a shave.  </li>
      <li>BestBuy.com sells it for the same price with free shipping.  </li>
      <li>It is so much easier ordering from Amazon than going to the store</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s too much.  </li>
      <li>$15.00 shipping for 2 refills is really too much.</li>
      <li>Much needed cleaning cartridges for Braun shaver.  </li>
      <li>Shake out as much water as you can, then rinse head with alcohol from drug store.  </li>
      <li>Removing, resealing, opening and reinserting cartridge is way too much hassle for me.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>and I think they work very well.</li>
      <li>Thanks RX America</li>
      <li>/&gt;The life time is reasonable considering the price</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use the alcohol cleaning function much.</li>
      <li>t product &amp; fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I always fill it up with 70% ethanol and it works very well</li>
      <li>Much cheaper than buying at the store.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Worth a few bucks at the most.  </li>
      <li>i&#x27;m still not convinced of the proper attitude to have toward this whole system that braun has to clean my razor everyday - is it a great way to maintain my razor and get a superior shave, or is it expensive overkill?</li>
      <li>To preserve the life of these refill cartridges I highly suggest to pop off the top of shaver and brush out loose hair trimmings before you have</li>
      <li>first save with my new Braun Syncro Shaving System</li>
      <li>can to the razor to get it extra clean.</li>
      <li>Another way to make it last longer is not to clean your shaver after every use, but rather just once or twice a week.</li>
      <li>It saves fluid and the shaver still keeps clean using this method.</li>
      <li>I only clean when I charge the battery, about once every 1 - 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>Another poster mentioned that the \\&quot;lubricant\\&quot; remains and is always in the cartridge, but I guess it&#x27;s not necessary to clean out the residues and what&#x27;s inside the cartridge BEFORE filling with your homemade alcohol??  </li>
      <li>fast shipping and will reorder it later especially with such good price ($7.30).</li>
      <li>I get clean, close and comfortable shaves, even when I&#x27;m half asleep in the early morning.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Having said all of that, though, the fact is that if you want to use the Braun shaver to its full potential, you have to buy these cartridges.  </li>
      <li>it is readily available at most hardware stores, but is far more expensive tthere than to buy these refills! &lt;</li>
      <li>For what appears to be a plastic tub full of alcohol (and blue dye) I think these should be cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that</li>
      <li>Lightly shake excessive alcohol from head, reassemble and then clean.  </li>
      <li>Just about the time that I need a new one, there is a package waiting at my front door!</li>
      <li>Every other clean and renew cartridge i&#x27;ve purchsed has contained blue liquid with a strong alcohol smell to it.  </li>
      <li>It is smoother than previous models and I love the self-cleaning feature.  </li>
      <li>This refill arrived very quickly and exactly as expected.  </li>
      <li>They are good at properly cleaning the blades and filtering out the dead, shaved skin cells as well.</li>
      <li>I am glad the refill cartridges are the same for the second generation systems.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure the regular use of this fluid has helped.</li>
      <li>, these refills do a decent job of the cleaning the razor for me.  </li>
      <li>The refills themselves are decently priced (compared to buying them in a store like Walmart).  </li>
      <li>only runs it 1-2 times per week as he often travels and brings the razor with him, so the cartridges last us longer than most people.</li>
      <li>Cost too much and is not good for very many cleanings.</li>
      <li>Really this is a non-issue, most razors I have had that cost well over $200 dont even seem to last that long</li>
      <li>However the price of the refills is amazingly high.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this system.</li>
      <li>You do not have to clean the shaver after every use as long as you take the head off and blow the stubble off...</li>
      <li>I am not even sure if it is really necessary or worth the mess it causes sometimes.</li>
      <li>It appears to just be alchohol with a little oil, but I wonder who has figured it out more acurately.</li>
      <li>Yes, seemingly a bit pricey but, after shaving with a Mach 3 Turbo prior to this, I am certain that I spent much more in a year on blades.  </li>
      <li>Manufacturers need to be a little more reasonable when they sell a product that requires a fairly frequent replacement.  </li>
      <li>My Braun is an older unit, but performs like new when you use&lt;br /&gt;these cartridges.</li>
      <li>Normally I&#x27;d be at Target or Wal-Mart purchasing these</li>
      <li>OEM, about the same price as local, easy to order.</li>
      <li>Definitely the right way to maintain a shaver.</li>
      <li>Good fast service, product is manufacturer quality, only thing missing is external packaging which is not needed for this type of product.</li>
      <li>Skin acids and oils, if left to linger on the razor&#x27;s edge, will eat away the micro fine teeth that give us such a close shave.</li>
      <li>The Lubricant is just as important as the alcohol and without it, the blades will not be as sharp.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like using a new shaver.  </li>
      <li>My razor cuts like it&#x27;s still brand new</li>
      <li>should Braun discontinue the offering of new cleaning cartridges.</li>
      <li>keeps my razor like new</li>
      <li>It clearly states that it is denatured alcohol!  </li>
      <li>Sure, you have to buy cartridges of cleaning solution, but I&#x27;m lazy, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
      <li>(I got a small funnel at a hobby store), add a tablespoon (15 mL) of polish remover, slosh to mix, then add alcohol to the mark being sure the container is on a level surface.</li>
      <li>I was hoping it would last longer, but it appears the only way to do that is to manually clean out the head before you drop it into the charger for auto-cleaning.</li>
      <li>Sometimes when I don&#x27;t get a chance to order extras and don&#x27;t clean my razor for a few days I can really feel the difference.</li>
      <li>Since I only clean the shaver only two or three times a month, the solution that came with the shaver lasted one year.  </li>
      <li>(I run the clean cycle about every other shave).  </li>
      <li>You can use it like any other shaver and clean it with a brush.  </li>
      <li>NEVER use anything other that water to clean the dirt collector&lt;BR&gt;, Once cleaned, shake the cartridge to remove any remaining water from inside.  </li>
      <li>Just remove the old one and put the new one in.  </li>
      <li>No muss, no fuss, and no little brush!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m finding it more convenient to use the cleaning system as it charges and cleans at the same time and requires less effort than cleaning the shaver manually.  </li>
      <li>Then I realised it contained pure water and no cleaning fluid!</li>
      <li>For the Braun cleaning solution, be aware that the red light comes on due to the level dropping low; it has nothing to do with the amount of hair debris in the solution.</li>
      <li>A refill will last me about 2 months or a little more.</li>
      <li>I finally had a chance to use one when the cartridge that originally came with the unit went dry.  </li>
      <li>Shaving is much more painful because the razor starts to pull your hair more instead of clipping it.     </li>
      <li>This product contained a clear liquid with no smell, I hope this isn&#x27;t a refilled/repackaged</li>
      <li>I came here for the price that Amazon offers.  </li>
      <li>As far as I am concerned it&#x27;s one of the benefits of the Braun shaver.</li>
      <li>However, since there is no competitive commercial product available to my knowledge, an objective comparison isn&#x27;t possible.  </li>
      <li>The Braun razor was quite loud as well.</li>
      <li>These do, however, make the area around them smell like alcohol during and after cleaning so if you are sensitive, be forewarned.  </li>
      <li>So far, no problems with these units.  </li>
      <li>Needed these to replace my old ones</li>
      <li>probably spend as much in Mach 3 Turbo blades and shaving gel over the time I expect the cleaner to last.  </li>
      <li>Since the fluid evaporates, you might as well use it as much as you want.</li>
      <li>It gives a very close shave, especially if used every day..</li>
      <li>they last much longer.</li>
      <li>This handy little item, of course, solves my other pet peeve, the claeaning part.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and small in sace.</li>
      <li>Not much that I can say other than the price of these is much better on Amazon</li>
      <li>/&gt;You could just clean the Braun with the little cleaning brush.  </li>
      <li>I have yet to use the spare cartridges I purchased as I still have the original cartridge that came with the Braun electric razor I purchased at Amazon a few months ago.  </li>
      <li>Shaving with a clean razor everyday spoils you...</li>
      <li>I like the idea of using a clean shaver everyday.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve replaced the cleaning fluid since mid.</li>
      <li>I installed the first one of the two cartridges sent and it is working as it was expected by me</li>
      <li>Item is necessary in order to keep your shaver operating as new.  </li>
      <li>It is nice to have the shaver clean itself, unfortunately if you run out and neglect to manually clean your shaver it will get a really weird hair film all over the inside.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the less than $9 it costs to get a set of these.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So, Braun - stop charging so much for a simple alcohol solution and design the cleaner to automatically &#x27;plug&#x27; the solution when its not in use to prevent evaporation, and you&#x27;ll earn that last star! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;</li>
      <li>Four months later I was still getting the same level of closeness as the very firsts have.  </li>
      <li>These are the standard refills for this rasor, no big surprise either way.&lt;br /&gt;Order fulfilled in reliable, fast manner.</li>
      <li>That being said, I had a crate of these I had to get rid of, but apparently shipping to some locations was prohibited!</li>
      <li>The item can get a little pricey but seems to be worth the product considering the value I receive.</li>
      <li>The refills are a little pricey, but the shaver is well worth it.  </li>
      <li>As long as I can continue to get these refills (and they tend to be hard to find at times), I will continue to use this shaver, and continue to love it.</li>
      <li>Cleaning daily with alcohol helped clear up my skin, but was time-consuming.</li>
      <li>, it looks like Amazon has fixed the shipping problem someone noted earlier.  </li>
      <li>Not much you can do really</li>
      <li>I found that the first cartridge I used lasted nearly 60 days even with everyday cleaning.  </li>
      <li>Replace the screen firmly and put the shaver into the cradle for cleaning right away.</li>
      <li>The refills are a small price to pay for the convenience of not having to open up your shaver every day to clean out the hairs.</li>
      <li>My order arrived ontime, however, one of the product boxes was taped with double side tape, one was from an older stock and appeared to have been wet from setting in water at some time.  </li>
      <li>But I think it is ok to clean it base on your preference.</li>
      <li>I keep pondering mixing my own solution, but I would hate to screw up my razor, which I do like very much.</li>
      <li>I think it is high due to the process and packaging.</li>
      <li>One of these end up lasting me 3-4 months easy; I didn&#x27;t have any evaporation issues like other people have mentioned, not sure why that is.</li>
      <li>Like the other reviews, the shaver feels brand new after each cleaning.</li>
      <li>Once again I have replaced my Braun Clean &amp; Renew 2 Cartridges for my shaver, when I stretched the past cartridges as long as possible.  </li>
      <li>Does a good job of cleaning, but is a little expensive for the amount of time that it last.</li>
      <li>Although the refills are expensive, they do keep the Braun shaver clean, sanitary and running like new.</li>

<li> I am always very happy with this Braun Clean @ Renew Refills.  </li>
<li> The clean and renew cartridges function flawlessly -</li>
<li> The best thing is your shaver feels renew after each clean.</li>
<li> The best thing about the CCR2 clean &amp; charge refills isn&#x27;t the product itself but the product that it&#x27;s used with.</li>
<li> Braun&#x27;s clean and renew is awesome.  </li>
<li> The price on this item appeared to good to be true, but it came in just as described and worked perfectly!</li>
<li> Very easy to switch out great buy</li>

<li> I was very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
<li> No need to describe - just works perfectly and worth the money when you buy in bulk and consider the time savings.</li>
<li> Great seller.  :-)</li>
<li> Very satisfied.</li>
<li> It was perfect and did the job just right.</li>
<li> So make sure to save the cap so that you can reseal the cartridge!</li>
<li> i love sloth!  </li>
<li> Excellent product to clean a top of the line shaver.</li>
<li> Amazing.</li>
<li> Also, I signed up for the subscription to get it shipped for free, and am so happy with not having to worry about buying it.</li>
<li> I also own a Norelco Quadra electric shaver and it works well also</li>
<li> Now, the razor seems to catch a good deal of the shaved whiskers, but many fall onto the sink or floor.  </li>
<li> Use at your own risk.</li>
<li> fill the cartridge with some warm water.</li>
<li> These cartridges are great for maintaining a healthy machine and they are sold by many vendors.</li>
<li> you make you own .</li>
<li> Was just refills, but shipped fast and arrived perfect</li>
<li> Product works great, I need it to clean my Braun Shaver.  </li>
<li> Great pricing on the \\&quot;auto-ship\\&quot; option for this, hopefully I picked the correct term, 2-pack every 6 months, I clean it every time and do that twice a week.</li>
<li> When I factor in the convenience of the electric razor and benefits of keeping it clean, this seems like a great product for me.</li>
<li> Clean and charge refills are great.  </li>
<li> This system of keeping shaver clean &amp; lubricated is great.</li>
<li> Happy with replacement Clean and renew.  </li>
<li> The solution was easy to install, has a nice odor, and does a good job cleaning the shaver.    </li>
<li> The new Braun shaver, which I&#x27;ve reviewed also, is an excellent device, and the shave is quite comparable to a blade.</li>
<li> , these things are very easy to spill when installing.  </li>
<li> Very easy to use refills.  </li>
<li> love having a clean razor when I shave and these Braun cleaners work great.</li>
<li> It would be nice if there was more of a cycle</li>
<li> Great product, easy to install and is cheap.  </li>
<li> I make my own aftershave lotion by mixing rubbing alcohol + baby oil + water, mostly alcohol (17 parts), oil (3 parts), water (1 part), more oil if you want your skin to be softer, but it will shine.</li>
<li> All in all, I&#x27;m always happy with the consistent performance with this product.  </li>
<li> and I am delighted to finally be able to clean my razor again.</li>
<li> It was great being able to go to Amazon and find exactly what I needed and order it.  </li>
<li> price was good and service was quick.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s easy to make it on your own</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve purchased many replacement refill cartridges over that time.  </li>
<li> I have read the reviews of these replacement cartridges for a razor that, in my opinion, shaves better than a blade and the biggest gripe seemed to be the cost.  </li>
<li> This razor can be used without the &amp;quot;clean and charge&amp;quot; system but everyone seems to love that feature and wouldn&#x27;t want to give it up.  </li>
<li> They are not the most reliable delivery service but sometimes all one can afford.</li>
<li> so I am glad Amazon stocks it.</li>
<li> OK, so are you one of those people who would just rather not spend any time cleaning your electric razor?  </li>
<li> Every morning when I finish shaving, I just put the shaver in the attachment, and it does its magic.</li>
<li> I have had my Syncro Shaver System for about a year now and love it.  </li>
<li> I have owned a Braun 8595 shaving system for about a year and am well pleased with its performance and value.  </li>
<li> Anything more than</li>
<li> What more can I say?  </li>
<li> This was the best price I could find at the time of purchase, but I recommend you shop around, including locally.  </li>
<li> There isn&#x27;t much more to say.</li>
<li> I love the lemon scent.  </li>
<li> Totally satisfied with product.</li>
<li> with better results.  </li>
<li> My husband is pleased with the refills -- they work well.</li>
<li> I love getting them from Amazon because they are cheaper</li>
<li> Do this by taking the cartridge out of the cleaning station and then look through the holes on the top of the cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
<li> Place the cleaned and refilled cleaning cartridge in to the cleaning station and start using and enjoying the savings.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> My husband asked for a better quality electric shaver.  </li>
<li> This is more convenient.</li>
<li> also has a interesting smell (fruit and loops).</li>
<li> Seems to work OK.</li>
<li> This product met my expectations however I should have purchased a four or more pack.</li>
<li> Replacing the razor head every 18 months also helps keep razor performance top notch.</li>
<li> It cleans, lubricates and makes your shave experience much better.</li>
<li> I am sure I am getting better shaves and longer life out the shaver because of it.  ...</li>
<li> I have used a Braun razor for many years and sometimes cannot find the cleaner</li>
<li> My life is so much better from using Braun shavers and this Braun cleaner.  </li>
<li> They are a better buy here than at wallmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> for sure purchase again.</li>
<li> This stuff keeps my electric razor nice and clean.  </li>
<li> Keeps my shaver clean and also maintains the foil blades quite nicely.</li>
<li> I use this over and over since I clean my shaver before I run it through the cleaner for the nice smell and oil they put in it to keep the razor head sharpened.</li>
<li> After using Norelco for 30+ years I switched to Braun mainly because of the cleaning system and am happy with the change.</li>
<li> I wish these things did not smell like lemon dish soap, but they do keep my razor very clean.</li>
<li> They already comand a pretty good price for the razor.  </li>
<li> The cartridges were received promptly, in good condition and work exactly as advertised.</li>
<li> I love my Syncro Shaver and these refills are easy to install.</li>
<li> amazing price and arrived quick.</li>
<li> wish you many more close, clean,and comfortable shaves using your Braun Syncro Shaver System.</li>
<li> good for large cooler</li>
<li> I am, and since I started using the Braun Clean and Renew refills, I have learned  how easy cleaning a razor could be!  </li>
<li> Hopefully I will get 2 or 3 more weeks from it since the \\&quot;Half\\&quot; light hasn&#x27;t come on yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using the Braun 7526 shaver and cleaning stand for 5+ years, and have found it to be the best balance of close shave with minimal irritation.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been doing this for 3 years and have not seen any damage to the shaver, the cardle, or most importantly to my skin.</li>
<li> So glad to have these available through Amazon.com.  </li>
<li> Nevertheless I keep using it because it really does do a good cleaning and lube job on the shaver.</li>
<li> Does it really matter if your shaver smells good?</li>
<li> Does what its supposed to with that nice lemony fresh scent.</li>
<li> I really like my Braun shaver and these cleaning cartridges are easy to install and keep the shaver in good shape.</li>
<li> I suppose the problem here is that this solution isn&#x27;t the most environmentally friendly stuff ever...</li>
<li> After a good cleaning cycle, the razor works like it&#x27;s brand new!  </li>
<li> Easy to install, and they do the job.</li>
<li> I must have thrown away 20-30 containers which could easily be washed out and refilled with the cleaner.  </li>
<li> I love these clean and renew cartridges.</li>
<li> , you have to clean the razors and these cartridges are what most require in some form.</li>
<li> it was easy to find refills for my braun ccr2 syncro shaver at amazon.com.</li>
<li> love Braun Clean &amp; Renew merchandise product</li>
<li> easy item to use</li>
<li> the clean &amp; shave system saves me time, but costs more.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s easy to install</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s easy to throw out.  </li>
<li> I just think Braun did us all a great service in being innovative and constantly improving its products.  </li>
<li> It makes my shaving easy</li>
<li> something produced by braun for their machines, should work, dont wash your razors with water, the washing stand takes more time to clean it</li>
<li> Easy to deal with</li>
<li> and it is much quicker and more effective.  </li>
<li> The good news is that since these cleaning refill cartridges are made by the manufacturer, they are an exact fit, and they work just the way the original cartridge does.  </li>
<li> Make your shaver as good a a brand new ones each time.</li>
<li> New origional Braun cleaning solution at a good price.  </li>
<li> so it&#x27;s fine for me to wait 3-5 days between cleanings.  </li>
<li> The order was handled and shipped fine.</li>
<li> the refills that are available make cleaning so easy.  </li>
<li> This Cleaning system was designed to preserve the micro fine \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; on the razor&#x27;s blades.</li>
<li> The home made solution worked fine.</li>
<li> I guess I should have read the fine print on the listing.</li>
<li> They work fine of course, but your shaver will smell like you cleaned it with Pledge.</li>
<li> It works just fine.</li>
<li> The packaging also was fine since the liquid should not be under pressure.&lt;br</li>
<li> My husband says they work fine and cost about $0.25 per refill.  </li>
<li> The order was handled and shipped fine.</li>
<li> They worked just fine.</li>
<li> They fit cleaning unit and work fine</li>
<li> These work fine, but after these ran out, I started making my own with straight rubbing alcohol.  </li>
<li> All 4 could have easily fit into just one of these boxes.</li>
<li> and I enjoy the shaving results after using the cartridge.</li>
<li> They have a lemon-alcohol kind of scent to them which I have grown to really like.</li>
<li> I have found that the green rubbing alcohol works great!  </li>
<li> I have had quite a few Braun electric shavers over the years, and this one is the best.  </li>
<li> Free usage.</li>
<li> but when it&#x27;s at your door two days after ordering for free.</li>
<li> Sure, it is a bit pricey, but worth the money if you value your time.</li>
<li> The refills are not ultra cheap but neither is the razor.  </li>
<li> Is there any sense in buying a razor which is cleanable if you&#x27;re going to cheap out on the cleaner?  </li>
<li> You wouldn&#x27;t put cheap tires on a race car</li>
<li> This razor makes my husband face smooth and fabulous.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a hunk of plastic filled with alcohol and a touch of fragrance.  </li>
<li> They should be available this way for some persons.</li>
<li> The thing&#x27;s got alcohol to clean and disinfect (for the face that is important) and lubricant which makes the blades strong longer.  </li>
<li> seem to be original Worked fine</li>
<li> Better fit and do the job right.</li>
<li> like the other braun products this is also very good quality and durable.</li>
<li> Also only use auto clean once or twice a week, this system works great for me.</li>
<li> They totally take away the hassle of having to fix and clean your shaver and they do a great job at it.</li>
<li> Much as I enjoyed the thorough cleaning and fresh lemon scent, don&#x27;t believe the hype about \\&quot;special cleaning agents\\&quot; and \\&quot;blade lubricants\\&quot;; these cartridges don&#x27;t contain either.  </li>
<li> A cheap solution to keep the blade clean for every shave</li>
<li> I received the Braun clean and renew packet with no base.  </li>
<li> The Clean &amp; Renew cartridges help keep my shaver smooth running and lubricated.  </li>
<li> No other price is fair.</li>
<li> The Clean &amp; Renew System is a very useful feature, and these refills are required to use it.  </li>
<li> We weren&#x27;t able to find the refills in the store and this was so easy and fast.  </li>
<li> I am pleased that this does exactly what it is supposed to do...and my shaver is always in tip-top condition being cleaned with this solution automatically.  </li>
<li> Between cleans, remove the cartridge from the cleaning machine and reseal the cartridge with the original plastic tab.  </li>
<li> There shoud be a way to obtain the fluid in bulk at a much reduced price would make the product much more attractive.  </li>
<li> Factory replacement for the original cleaning solution.</li>
<li> Based on the pictures on Amazon&#x27;s web site, I was expecting to receive an unboxed item, but the refills were in its original retail packaging.  </li>
<li> Once a week, remove head and rinse it and top of shaver under hot water.  </li>
<li> This product works as well with my shaver system as did the original.  </li>
<li> Works very good wish it was less cheaper</li>
<li> Product is original manufacturer&#x27;s replacement for Braun Clean &amp; Renew Electric</li>
<li> He liked it so well, he asked for a new one this Xmas.</li>
<li> You can still clean it with the brush if you like...</li>
<li> It does what it is sold to do-keep your razor clean.  </li>
<li> Keeps your electric razor clean and lubricated.</li>
<li> I also use the brush that came with my razor and clean off anything I can before putting it in for a cleaning.  </li>
<li> the auto clean do</li>
<li> This product is used to clean and lubricate your Braun electric razors.</li>
<li> Besides cleaning your shaver it also lubricates your shaver&#x27;s mechanical parts after each clean, which extend the life of your shaver&#x27;s blade.</li>
<li> Although it stated that you have to clean it after every shaves.</li>
<li> the Braun system, you need to purchase the Clean &amp; Renew refills and change them about every 2 months.</li>
<li> Without this cleaning solution for your Braun 85xx series shaver you&#x27;ll have to clean it by hand with the brush.</li>
<li> Here&#x27;s how:  Clean your razor once a week instead of every day.  </li>
<li> I got these Clean and Renew refills for my Braun shaver.  </li>
<li> They keep my shaver clean and oiled.  </li>
<li> I ordered 2 boxes or the Braun CCR2 Syncro Shaver System Clean &amp; Renew Refills.  </li>
<li> Yep, a product I have to buy in order to clean my electric razor.</li>
<li> It does what it is suppose to, which is to clean the Braun razor.</li>
<li> i do have a clean razor to use every morning</li>
<li> With a touch of a button I can go into the bathroom and clean the thing, which helps keep all the hair off the sink and counter.  </li>
<li> They are the cartridges to clean the Brun shaver.</li>
<li> razor clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I just clean out the foil after every shave .Helps makes for an absolutely clean shave.</li>
<li> They keep my shaver clean and oiled.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried to clean my Braun without using this system.  </li>
<li> Works well to clean and lubricate.</li>
<li> Works as advertised, no problems, keeps the shaver clean and nicer to use.</li>
<li> you can use many different things to make your own</li>
<li> Clean the shaver once a week.</li>
<li> Braun Clean &amp; Renew Cartridges&lt;br</li>
<li> They keep my shaver clean.</li>
<li> the clean and renew cartridges work well</li>
<li> I love the blades, the shaver&#x27;s head, and most of all, I like the fresh new razor feel every time I need to shave.  </li>
<li> It is nice to start fresh with new clean solution.</li>
<li> Great price and item as expected</li>
<li> but I&#x27;d really like to see more thought put into this (</li>
<li> good enough for 6 months.</li>
<li> Braun Clean &amp; Renew Refills seem adequate in performance.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think its worth the money - these things aren&#x27;t cheap and,</li>
<li> The polish remover is good at removing the oils left on the cutter/foil, and the non-drying formula leaves a trace of oily ingredient that seems to help lube the shaver as well.</li>
<li> have used one for a full year already.</li>
<li> After 45 days or so, the fluid started to darken and by about 60 days, it was too full of debris to continue to use in good conscience.  </li>
<li> You have to decide if $5/month is worth your time and effort to clean your shaver (even once a week) plus knowing that the cleaning solution has removed the oil and bacteria off the head and foil to minimize infection or in-grown wiskers.</li>
<li> That way the bits of hair come out and the fresh alcohol rinses the filter clean.  </li>
<li> It also leaves a fresh &amp; clean smell.</li>
<li> The shaver stays clean and fresh.  </li>
<li> Keeps your shaver clean and fresh.  </li>
<li> It provides a fresh and clean shave every morning.</li>
<li> All arrived quickly with each in a separate oversized box.</li>
<li> though they go quick.  </li>
<li> that next shave feels so good and smells fresh.  </li>
<li> and they come quickly.</li>
<li> Need to clean every week for best shaving, so they don&#x27;t last long.  </li>
<li> It pays to purchase these refill cartridges for this great Electric Razor rather then the original and save a few dollars.</li>
<li> There is no noticeable difference if you clean the shaver more frequently.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think husband could live without it now.  :-)</li>
<li> Glad I found the subscribe and save option; now new ones are always on the way just in time.</li>
<li> Below is the Easy Eight Step System to saving money you need to look inside the cartridge to see how much dirt, grease, and hair is in there.  </li>
<li> This system is perfect for lazy people, and it does get the shaver much cleaner then running it under water.</li>
<li> The next morning the shaver is ready for use again, and there&#x27;s a pleasant lemony smell to it, which I like.</li>
<li> Does a great job but a little expensive-probably the container.</li>
<li> It was used a lot since he has a heavy beard and he traveled a great deal.</li>
<li> Great product all round.</li>
<li> If it uses the Intense setting, it will use the liquid more and will probably have a greater tendency to last for a shorter period of time.  </li>
<li> Or, buy the Braun Refills if you think the lemon fragrance is worth $10 a month...</li>
<li> They are reasonably priced and last a good amount of time.</li>
<li> but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
<li> rather disappointingly, I&#x27;m not a millionaire, so</li>
<li> Amazon offers a much better price.  </li>
<li> So convenient, worth it.</li>
<li> It leaves it lemony fresh.</li>
<li> Nice that it was the same price as in store without the hassle of having to go into a store!</li>
<li> Make the blades cut smoother, and smell fresh.</li>
<li> .. now it makes everything so useful</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
<li> I know it&#x27;s about $10 per 2 to 2 and 1/2 months, but it is worth it.  </li>
<li> THE PHILADELPHIA EAGLES ARE ALL A DIS TASTE FULL ORGANIZATION OF STREET THUG MENTALITITY TO CONDONE THE SOCIAL BEHAVIOR OF WATCHING, PROMOTING, ENJOYING AND ENCOURAGING</li>
<li> It&#x27;s amazing how much bacteria-attracting goop can collect in an electric razor, even if you brush it clean daily.  </li>
<li> As some other reviewers have suggested, this is possibly the world&#x27;s greatest shaver system.  </li>
<li> By removing most of the debris, the fluid stays clean for 3 months.  </li>
<li> this is a simple refill, easy in and easy out.</li>
<li> This fluid sure works wonders with the clean n charge machine.  </li>
<li> I would recommend these to anyone that could use them and the price was right.</li>
<li> , I had to purchase it right on the spot.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
<li> and it comes right to your door.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
<li> These things are very pricey; if you clean every day, and if a cartridge lasts about 30 cleanings, you&#x27;ll spend about $60 per year.  </li>
<li> It is a very convenient way to clean and lubricate the shaving head.</li>
<li> Between my brush cleaning and use of the cleaning system after every use of the razor, my razor is always clean and ready.</li>
<li> I wash thoroughly with water after every use, and do an economic clean once or maybe twice a week.</li>
<li> the refills last about a month and are very easy to replace.  </li>
<li> I own a Braun Series 7 and use the Clean &amp; Renew feature every other time I shave.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s worth a few bucks a month to keep it in the best condition possible.</li>
<li> having the &#x27;new shaver&#x27; feel every day isn&#x27;t justified.</li>
<li> They make the shaver feel new each time I use it, and there is a light lemon scent that helps invigorate me each morning.    </li>
<li> He really likes the razor -- very much!</li>
<li> Very fast service.</li>
<li> When the indicator light on the cradle shows low fluid level, top the cartridge off with rubbing alcohol - 70% isopropyl - readily available at every pharmacy.  </li>
<li> They keep your razor extremly clean which keeps the cutting blades at their best.  </li>
<li> Better than going to local Target which doesn&#x27;t carry them anymore anyway.</li>
<li> I would rather pay the same price for something representing a higher order of thought even if the solution and materials cost me more than this plastic-packaged monstrosity.</li>
<li> Thanks Braun!</li>
<li> These refills do exactly what they are supposed to do, as you can read in the product description.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> /&gt;It is a necessary item that would be better off at a lower price.</li>
<li> First is the cost.  </li>
<li> Otherwise, if you just leave the top open it will evaporate in a month whether you use it or not.</li>
<li> But that&#x27;s all a bit too much effort for me...!</li>
<li> I got the first generation Syncro shaver cleaning systems when they first came out.</li>
<li> The second generation systems are intelligent enough to automatically decide how intense a cleanning session your shaver needs.</li>
<li> After cleaning-- the razor smells and operates like the first time I took it out of the box.  </li>
<li> On trips ,I just wash the shaver head out with water but the cleaning cartridge is better for the shaver in daily use.</li>
<li> most of the annoyance of owning an electric razor is cleaning it, but this takes the work of cleaning and makes it a simple task.  </li>
<li> It is exactly as described in the product description.</li>
<li> At 5 bucks or more a cartridge that last a matter of a couple of weeks</li>
<li> The alcohol in the fluid removes most of the tap water preventing corrosion of the shaver.</li>
<li> These are the first cartridges I&#x27;ve purchased in months.</li>
<li> Third one over many years.</li>
<li> Still on my first cartridge.</li>
<li> You can go online and make your own cleaning solution using an empty Braun cleaning solution cartridge.</li>
<li> It really begs the question of how people on Catalina Island keep their electric razors hygienic!?</li>
<li> As for the \\&quot;advice\\&quot; of do-it-yourself adding alcohol, if you&#x27;re gonna do that, why buy this \\&quot;system\\&quot; in the first place?  </li>
<li> , why not just buy any generic electric shaver and just throw the blade and netting into a cup with the alcohol to save more money??  </li>
<li> Some people refill these, to me there is nothing like the fresh lemon scent these real braun cartridges.  </li>
<li> Produce exactly as promoted.</li>
<li> Several purchases ,the product has kept my Braun razor in tip top shape price &#x3D; value</li>
<li> Product seems to be an exact replacement for my shaver.</li>
<li> I find the braun shaver I bought to be quite good if I shave everyday rather than let my beard grow and cleanup is easier with this system.</li>
<li> Anyhow, I&#x27;m all for saving money and finding a good substitute for trivial expenses such as this, but you&#x27;ll miss the \\&quot;lubricant\\&quot; ingredient and the other fine Braun contents.  </li>
<li> I know lots love the conventional blade from Gillette or Schick, but electric razors are so convenient and easy and fast, I just save minutes using the electric shaver.  </li>
<li> The shaver head remains sharp for greater than the recommend replacement period of 18 months, undoubtedly facilitated by the clean and renew solution.</li>
<li> the cartridge if completely full of hair and dirt, most likely you will have no option but to purchase a new cartridge.</li>
<li> I originally doubted that bathing my razor in a special fluid would help at all, but it really works!</li>
<li> Also, my razor unit indicates that an \\&quot;Eco\\&quot; clean is needed after one shave, so I only clean the razor every two shaves.  </li>
<li> thank you very much it helped me very much and fast safe delivery will definitly use this again especially when i have to refill</li>
<li> If you have a Braun Electric Razor with Cleaning Station, these are a must to keep it clean and fully charged with no trouble.</li>
<li> Also, I do enjoy the fresh lime smell of the fluid used in the process.  </li>
<li> With the subscribe and save discount, I am pleased with these, even though I am not completely convinced they do a thorough cleaning.</li>
<li> , it&#x27;s pretty straight forward.  </li>
<li> I would be far more satisfied cleaning out the old one and refilling it with new solution from a simple canister.</li>
<li> Braun ought to offer refills for the plastic fluid containers and design them to be easily cleaned and refilled.</li>
<li> If Braun would get smart and sell a refill kit which came with a quart or two of solution and replacement filters, I&#x27;d buy that.  </li>
<li> Smart idea for Braun to make a product that will keep bringing money in until the product breaks.</li>
<li> Do this until you are satisfied with the level of cleanliness or conclude only a new replacement cartridge in needed.</li>
<li> There is not much about this refill product you can say much except that it does keep your Braun nice &amp; clean and ready for the next run.</li>
<li> In any event, regardless of the actual congestion of the foil razor after shave, these cleaning cartridges do a fine job a rinsing them away.  </li>
<li> The refills are a little pricey and I have found that alcohol works as well - without the nice smell however.</li>
<li> was several years ago when I first saw the &lt;b&gt;Braun 7525 Syncro Shaver System with Clean &amp; Charge Refills&lt;/b&gt;</li>
<li> All in all, a very easy and simple way to keep your blades clean and sharp, and ready to use whenever the beard calls.</li>
<li> Then turn the cartridge upside right and let sit for a day or two until full dry on the inside&lt;BR&gt;, Fill the dry cleaning cartridge with Isopropyl alcohol between ¨ø and ¨ú up to the top.</li>
<li> Product came fast, works as advertised.</li>
<li> So my hats off to Amazon for reading the comments here and making the shipping reasonable.  </li>
<li> I hope they can keep prices low and shipping free with this inefficiency.</li>
<li> It has a reasonable cartridge life</li>
<li> These really work too.</li>
<li> A very convenient method of cleaning.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m much happier now with my Norelco razor.</li>
<li> but they evaporate kinda fast.</li>
<li> (you get used to is fast) &lt;br</li>
<li> I really don&#x27;t feel like cleaning my razor after a shave.  </li>
<li> BestBuy.com sells it for the same price with free shipping.  </li>
<li> It is so much easier ordering from Amazon than going to the store</li>
<li> that&#x27;s too much.  </li>
<li> $15.00 shipping for 2 refills is really too much.</li>
<li> Much needed cleaning cartridges for Braun shaver.  </li>
<li> Shake out as much water as you can, then rinse head with alcohol from drug store.  </li>
<li> Removing, resealing, opening and reinserting cartridge is way too much hassle for me.</li>
<li> thanks</li>
<li> and I think they work very well.</li>
<li> Thanks RX America</li>
<li> /&gt;The life time is reasonable considering the price</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t use the alcohol cleaning function much.</li>
<li> t product &amp; fast shipping.</li>
<li> I always fill it up with 70% ethanol and it works very well</li>
<li> Much cheaper than buying at the store.</li>
<li> Fast shipping.</li>
<li> Worth a few bucks at the most.  </li>
<li> i&#x27;m still not convinced of the proper attitude to have toward this whole system that braun has to clean my razor everyday - is it a great way to maintain my razor and get a superior shave, or is it expensive overkill?</li>
<li> To preserve the life of these refill cartridges I highly suggest to pop off the top of shaver and brush out loose hair trimmings before you have</li>
<li> first save with my new Braun Syncro Shaving System</li>
<li> can to the razor to get it extra clean.</li>
<li> Another way to make it last longer is not to clean your shaver after every use, but rather just once or twice a week.</li>
<li> It saves fluid and the shaver still keeps clean using this method.</li>
<li> I only clean when I charge the battery, about once every 1 - 2 weeks.</li>
<li> Another poster mentioned that the \\&quot;lubricant\\&quot; remains and is always in the cartridge, but I guess it&#x27;s not necessary to clean out the residues and what&#x27;s inside the cartridge BEFORE filling with your homemade alcohol??  </li>
<li> fast shipping and will reorder it later especially with such good price ($7.30).</li>
<li> I get clean, close and comfortable shaves, even when I&#x27;m half asleep in the early morning.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Having said all of that, though, the fact is that if you want to use the Braun shaver to its full potential, you have to buy these cartridges.  </li>
<li> it is readily available at most hardware stores, but is far more expensive tthere than to buy these refills! &lt;</li>
<li> For what appears to be a plastic tub full of alcohol (and blue dye) I think these should be cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that</li>
<li> Lightly shake excessive alcohol from head, reassemble and then clean.  </li>
<li> Just about the time that I need a new one, there is a package waiting at my front door!</li>
<li> Every other clean and renew cartridge i&#x27;ve purchsed has contained blue liquid with a strong alcohol smell to it.  </li>
<li> It is smoother than previous models and I love the self-cleaning feature.  </li>
<li> This refill arrived very quickly and exactly as expected.  </li>
<li> They are good at properly cleaning the blades and filtering out the dead, shaved skin cells as well.</li>
<li> I am glad the refill cartridges are the same for the second generation systems.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m sure the regular use of this fluid has helped.</li>
<li> , these refills do a decent job of the cleaning the razor for me.  </li>
<li> The refills themselves are decently priced (compared to buying them in a store like Walmart).  </li>
<li> only runs it 1-2 times per week as he often travels and brings the razor with him, so the cartridges last us longer than most people.</li>
<li> Cost too much and is not good for very many cleanings.</li>
<li> Really this is a non-issue, most razors I have had that cost well over $200 dont even seem to last that long</li>
<li> However the price of the refills is amazingly high.  </li>
<li> Highly recommended.</li>
<li> I highly recommend this system.</li>
<li> You do not have to clean the shaver after every use as long as you take the head off and blow the stubble off...</li>
<li> I am not even sure if it is really necessary or worth the mess it causes sometimes.</li>
<li> It appears to just be alchohol with a little oil, but I wonder who has figured it out more acurately.</li>
<li> Yes, seemingly a bit pricey but, after shaving with a Mach 3 Turbo prior to this, I am certain that I spent much more in a year on blades.  </li>
<li> Manufacturers need to be a little more reasonable when they sell a product that requires a fairly frequent replacement.  </li>
<li> My Braun is an older unit, but performs like new when you use&lt;br /&gt;these cartridges.</li>
<li> Normally I&#x27;d be at Target or Wal-Mart purchasing these</li>
<li> OEM, about the same price as local, easy to order.</li>
<li> Definitely the right way to maintain a shaver.</li>
<li> Good fast service, product is manufacturer quality, only thing missing is external packaging which is not needed for this type of product.</li>
<li> Skin acids and oils, if left to linger on the razor&#x27;s edge, will eat away the micro fine teeth that give us such a close shave.</li>
<li> The Lubricant is just as important as the alcohol and without it, the blades will not be as sharp.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s like using a new shaver.  </li>
<li> My razor cuts like it&#x27;s still brand new</li>
<li> should Braun discontinue the offering of new cleaning cartridges.</li>
<li> keeps my razor like new</li>
<li> It clearly states that it is denatured alcohol!  </li>
<li> Sure, you have to buy cartridges of cleaning solution, but I&#x27;m lazy, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
<li> (I got a small funnel at a hobby store), add a tablespoon (15 mL) of polish remover, slosh to mix, then add alcohol to the mark being sure the container is on a level surface.</li>
<li> I was hoping it would last longer, but it appears the only way to do that is to manually clean out the head before you drop it into the charger for auto-cleaning.</li>
<li> Sometimes when I don&#x27;t get a chance to order extras and don&#x27;t clean my razor for a few days I can really feel the difference.</li>
<li> Since I only clean the shaver only two or three times a month, the solution that came with the shaver lasted one year.  </li>
<li> (I run the clean cycle about every other shave).  </li>
<li> You can use it like any other shaver and clean it with a brush.  </li>
<li> NEVER use anything other that water to clean the dirt collector&lt;BR&gt;, Once cleaned, shake the cartridge to remove any remaining water from inside.  </li>
<li> Just remove the old one and put the new one in.  </li>
<li> No muss, no fuss, and no little brush!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m finding it more convenient to use the cleaning system as it charges and cleans at the same time and requires less effort than cleaning the shaver manually.  </li>
<li> Then I realised it contained pure water and no cleaning fluid!</li>
<li> For the Braun cleaning solution, be aware that the red light comes on due to the level dropping low; it has nothing to do with the amount of hair debris in the solution.</li>
<li> A refill will last me about 2 months or a little more.</li>
<li> I finally had a chance to use one when the cartridge that originally came with the unit went dry.  </li>
<li> Shaving is much more painful because the razor starts to pull your hair more instead of clipping it.     </li>
<li> This product contained a clear liquid with no smell, I hope this isn&#x27;t a refilled/repackaged</li>
<li> I came here for the price that Amazon offers.  </li>
<li> As far as I am concerned it&#x27;s one of the benefits of the Braun shaver.</li>
<li> However, since there is no competitive commercial product available to my knowledge, an objective comparison isn&#x27;t possible.  </li>
<li> The Braun razor was quite loud as well.</li>
<li> These do, however, make the area around them smell like alcohol during and after cleaning so if you are sensitive, be forewarned.  </li>
<li> So far, no problems with these units.  </li>
<li> Needed these to replace my old ones</li>
<li> probably spend as much in Mach 3 Turbo blades and shaving gel over the time I expect the cleaner to last.  </li>
<li> Since the fluid evaporates, you might as well use it as much as you want.</li>
<li> It gives a very close shave, especially if used every day..</li>
<li> they last much longer.</li>
<li> This handy little item, of course, solves my other pet peeve, the claeaning part.</li>
<li> Easy to use and small in sace.</li>
<li> Not much that I can say other than the price of these is much better on Amazon</li>
<li> /&gt;You could just clean the Braun with the little cleaning brush.  </li>
<li> I have yet to use the spare cartridges I purchased as I still have the original cartridge that came with the Braun electric razor I purchased at Amazon a few months ago.  </li>
<li> Shaving with a clean razor everyday spoils you...</li>
<li> I like the idea of using a clean shaver everyday.</li>
<li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve replaced the cleaning fluid since mid.</li>
<li> I installed the first one of the two cartridges sent and it is working as it was expected by me</li>
<li> Item is necessary in order to keep your shaver operating as new.  </li>
<li> It is nice to have the shaver clean itself, unfortunately if you run out and neglect to manually clean your shaver it will get a really weird hair film all over the inside.  </li>
<li> Well worth the less than $9 it costs to get a set of these.</li>
<li> /&gt;So, Braun - stop charging so much for a simple alcohol solution and design the cleaner to automatically &#x27;plug&#x27; the solution when its not in use to prevent evaporation, and you&#x27;ll earn that last star! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;</li>
<li> Four months later I was still getting the same level of closeness as the very firsts have.  </li>
<li> These are the standard refills for this rasor, no big surprise either way.&lt;br /&gt;Order fulfilled in reliable, fast manner.</li>
<li> That being said, I had a crate of these I had to get rid of, but apparently shipping to some locations was prohibited!</li>
<li> The item can get a little pricey but seems to be worth the product considering the value I receive.</li>
<li> The refills are a little pricey, but the shaver is well worth it.  </li>
<li> As long as I can continue to get these refills (and they tend to be hard to find at times), I will continue to use this shaver, and continue to love it.</li>
<li> Cleaning daily with alcohol helped clear up my skin, but was time-consuming.</li>
<li> , it looks like Amazon has fixed the shipping problem someone noted earlier.  </li>
<li> Not much you can do really</li>
<li> I found that the first cartridge I used lasted nearly 60 days even with everyday cleaning.  </li>
<li> Replace the screen firmly and put the shaver into the cradle for cleaning right away.</li>
<li> The refills are a small price to pay for the convenience of not having to open up your shaver every day to clean out the hairs.</li>
<li> My order arrived ontime, however, one of the product boxes was taped with double side tape, one was from an older stock and appeared to have been wet from setting in water at some time.  </li>
<li> But I think it is ok to clean it base on your preference.</li>
<li> I keep pondering mixing my own solution, but I would hate to screw up my razor, which I do like very much.</li>
<li> I think it is high due to the process and packaging.</li>
<li> One of these end up lasting me 3-4 months easy; I didn&#x27;t have any evaporation issues like other people have mentioned, not sure why that is.</li>
<li> Like the other reviews, the shaver feels brand new after each cleaning.</li>
<li> Once again I have replaced my Braun Clean &amp; Renew 2 Cartridges for my shaver, when I stretched the past cartridges as long as possible.  </li>
<li> Does a good job of cleaning, but is a little expensive for the amount of time that it last.</li>
<li> Although the refills are expensive, they do keep the Braun shaver clean, sanitary and running like new.</li>
<li> Cleaning every other day may seem like a money-saving idea, but I have found that even if you don&#x27;t use it for weeks, the cleaning fluid still evaporates and you have to replace it almost as frequently, so I figure I might as well get the benefit of cleaning rather than</li>
<li> First, just after buying it for my son I realized that it was in fact NOT suitable for children under 3.</li>
<li> This will remove most of the facial grease and loosen the hair attached to the sponge-like dirt collector at the bottom of the cartridge&lt;BR&gt;, poor the water from the cartridge down the sink drain.  </li>
<li> That said, I really find it COMPLETELY unnecessary for Braun to require you to buy an entire new plastic pack to go with every refill.  </li>
<li> The only reservation is that it does not last long.</li>
<li> Dump the remaining solution; add water through the small hole and shake well to get as much of the hair debris out of the container.</li>
<li> Although it does smell a bit like alcohol while it is doing its thing, the smell does not last long, and does not linger.</li>
<li> If I travel for a few days without the base to clean the razor, I&#x27;m more likely to get razor burn on my face and neck.  </li>
<li> My skin is not super sensitive</li>
<li> The only thing I have noticed is that once a razor is a few years old I think the product starts to wear the painting / coating on the plastic.</li>
<li> Over my lifetime I have had several other brands of electric shavers that provided &#x27;acceptable&#x27; shaving closeness and lasting ability of the non-replaceable battery.  </li>
<li> My husband only shaves every other day, so the refills do last twice as lone - up to 2 months!</li>
<li> As others have pointed out, you can definitely extend their life by cleaning every other day or every third day.</li>
<li> Mine razor has started to discolor a little as well as bubble / peel near the area the cleaner hits.</li>
<li> You could easily pour the cheap or even home-brew cleaner of your choice into the empty cartridge, but that would be a VERY bad idea.  </li>
<li> what I was looking for from long time</li>
<li> noticed that if you leave the shaver alone for a long time the liquid evaporates.  </li>
<li> I bought this razor because I had a tendency to not clean my razor regularly, which led to whiskers on my white dress shirt in the</li>
<li> I had read some mixed views on this (from other sources)</li>
<li> It did not take long to figure out how to refill the cartridge thus saving me money!  </li>
<li> Not exactly new.  </li>
<li> The volume of the solution is a little less than 6 ounces, but I make a mark on the side using a Sharpie when the container is new, and just fill to that level each time.</li>
<li> be to discard the package and loose the money.</li>
<li> and then I pour the remains in another partially filled cartridge for as long as I think the solution is not too used and dirty.  </li>
<li> The main criticism is the price charged - it is ridiculously overpriced.  </li>
<li> poor any remaining solution down the sink by gently shaking the cartridge several ways.</li>
<li> I shave an average of every other day or so and find each cartridge last me around 2 months.</li>
<li> Now, if only I could figure out a way to prevent those millions of little hairs from falling out of my shaver onto my bathroom sink each time I shave.  </li>
<li> Flushing with water and alcohol is the recommended method for water resistant shavers that do not have cleaners and this leaves as little debris as possible in shaver before cleaning.  </li>
<li> I also wish they would last a little longer.</li>
<li> The product is great but the service was awful.  </li>
<li> What can you say product works well and shuts off my dirty razor light.</li>
<li> and while I&#x27;m all for destroying the world one tossed plastic pack at a time and such...</li>
<li> These replacement cartridges work as expected.  </li>
<li> Probably nothing wrong with that since they are sealed, but for $2, I&#x27;ll just buy here to get the fresh stock.</li>
<li> Was expected.</li>
<li> ordered 2 cartridges and was wondering why when I replaced one, the shaver smelled and shaver head was always wet.</li>
<li> Also if you turn the cleaning solution/charging station on and the catridge is empty</li>
<li> They last for about 2 to 3 months for me, but that will depend on how many times you shave per month and what setting the razor base cleans the razor.  </li>
<li> , you only save about $2-$3 (depending on quantity) and some auctions claim their refills are old outdated stock.  </li>
<li> These are the typical refills I have been using for a long time.</li>
<li> I hope Amazon starts selling these things directly since buying it from J&amp;R is not a good deal because of the shipping charges.  </li>
<li> Arrived as expected and correctly fits my husbands Braun shaver!</li>
<li> have found no noticeable difference by cleaning my shaver every other use instead of every time.  </li>
<li> In reality, cleaning it every other day works just as well; I can&#x27;t detect any difference between every-day and every-other-day cleaning.  </li>
<li> I have determined that there is no way to return this item due to shipment requirements.  </li>
<li> Lemon has sugar (and other impurities) in it, and alcohol doesn&#x27;t have lubricating agents and may strip the lubricating that the blades need.      </li>
<li> Instead, go to Walgreens or some other store that sells the shaver system, and buy it there.  </li>
<li> DOGS TO RIP OTHER DOG&#x27;S</li>
<li> I have been using this product for two years now, but there is a major failure on the system designed by brown.</li>
<li> Despite slightly pricey, still cheaper than a wet razor, shaving cream, etc.</li>
<li> Buy a quart of Klean-Strip S-L-X Denatured Alcohol for less than $5, and every month or so shake the old dirty alcohol out of the SMALL HOLE and refill through the LARGE HOLE.  </li>
<li> I thought I&#x27;d never buy these things, I mean, why buy these expensive refills when you can just clean your shaver yourself.  </li>
<li> need seven more stupid words to finish this.</li>
<li> Had to call Amazon and part of it had to be delivered to his work address because they did not deliver after dark.</li>
<li> My only complaint is they are the lemon scented version.</li>
<li> solution is not evaporating as I expected, but even with all the wiskers trapped in the filter, the solution itself is getting darker.  </li>
<li> The fluid in the cartridge slowly evaporates but the lubricant does not.</li>
<li> I spent a few hundred dollars on a shaver.</li>
<li> That boils down to $5/month.  </li>
<li> I find it illogical and irritating to be getting charged for all this extra packaging every single time.  </li>
<li> The price charged on Amazon for this product is half of what it costs on the retail market.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve owned a Braun Syncro for about a year and a half now.  </li>
<li> but I don&#x27;t understand what the previous reviewer meant by &amp;quot;great price&amp;quot;.</li>
<li> Given the choice, I&#x27;d rather use the cleaner every day instead of less</li>
<li> If you try to stretch the product by using it less, you just end up paying for vapor.</li>
<li> Four and a half stars for the razor.  </li>
<li> One and a half for the alcolol &#x3D; 3 stars.</li>
<li> This is one less thing I have to remember.</li>
<li> B000050FDX Braun 7000FC Syncro Replacement Combo, Black]]</li>
<li> My shaver gets very dirty from shaving alot and the new cleaners always make the shaver new again...</li>
<li> It often spills, even if I haven&#x27;t moved it, causing a mess on the bathroom counter.</li>
<li> Well I&#x27;ve had my 8595 for over 3 weeks now and it looks like the solution is getting pretty dirty.  </li>
<li> They&#x27;re probably refillable if you can figure out how not to make a mess out of it; although I&#x27;d sooner dish out the 10$ a year for these in convenience.</li>
<li> This makes shaving a little less cumbersome.</li>
<li> If you leave this under your braun shaver they will evaporate in a few weeks or less.</li>
<li> But, getting a little pricey.</li>
<li> It will make you life a little easier using this auto-clean tool.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun electric razors for a few years now.  </li>
<li> so I guess that it&#x27;s the only game in town.</li>
<li> the time being, i am using the system as it has been designed - cleaning everyday.  </li>
<li> Put the cartridge upside-down on a folded paper towel and let the cartridge sit for a few hours.  </li>
<li> I typically use the cleaning solution twice a week; once on a Monday after a &#x27;heavy shave&#x27; (I can&#x27;t be bothered shaving at the weekend!)</li>
<li> I go through less than one a year!</li>
<li> But I wondered, \\&quot;How long with this cutter provide a terrific result before it would be time to replace the cutting</li>
<li> It&#x27;s the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had without cutting myself, and that includes the new triple blades.  </li>
<li> Not sure how often others change the refills, but I use the cleaning system about once a week and change the refills about once a month.</li>
<li> No more evaporation problem.  </li>
<li> No more cleaning of shaver heads.</li>
<li> not sure why people are trying their darndest to conserve the refills.  </li>
<li> Just add a couple ounces alcohol through the small hole</li>
<li> I used to replace these cleaning cartridges once every 3 weeks and was spending a small fortune on them ...</li>
<li> Ill be ordering again from the same person when I run out.</li>
<li> it seems like the prices on the refills are rapidly rising, and I&#x27;m not sure why.  </li>
<li> but I have to admit they are quite expensive especially since I replace them every 1.5 months.</li>
<li> too expensive and short lived ...</li>
<li> There were two things I always disliked about electric shavers: they didn&#x27;t cut close as a blade, and they required regular cleaning with that annoying little brush.</li>
<li> as opposed to the technically legal, yet astoundingly stupid, means this represents).  </li>
<li> Five bucks a month for a cartridge beats at least 10 dollars a month in blades</li>
<li> At least you could reuse the container over and over.  </li>
<li> cleaning fluid is dirty, leaving a brown stain on my shaver.  </li>
<li> Definitely improved performance as compared to what I had been using as it was quite dirty and need to be replaced.</li>
<li> (Does anyone know of another less expensive product?)</li>
<li> Still, one of the things I hated about shaving with a traditional manual razor was getting my hands wet, and having trails of water run up my forearm, or under my collar.  </li>
<li> I feel they could be less expensive.</li>
<li> Sorry this is not a full review as you would expect.  </li>
<li> I have been using this type of product for years and it does work, although quite expensive for some alcohol and a little oil.</li>
<li> cleaning cartridges are difficult to find, so, to get them in a few days without having to go store to store is&lt;br /&gt;terrific</li>
<li> However, word of caution, do not take the shaver out of the base before the cleaning process is done or you will have a wet, dripping mess.  </li>
<li> So, I am forced to order online!</li>
<li> Was not particularly happy with the UPS delivery.</li>
<li> However, I think it&#x27;s a rip-off.  </li>
<li> My charging base still says \\&quot;Full\\&quot; and about 3/4 of the liquid is left.</li>
<li> these prices, a solution had to be found so that I (everyone) could stay out of the poor house.  </li>
<li> Very simple to affix the replacement into the base of the cleaning unit and from there</li>
<li> I take the cartridge out of the base and replace the cap to keep the fluid from evaporating - that way</li>
<li> /&gt;Another bit of bad news is the mess.  </li>
<li> , I feel bad for being overly skeptical before. :/</li>
<li> Buy this item, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
<li> Whatever you put in won&#x27;t have the lubricants that the factory liquid does, and that will cause your replaceable but expensive cutter head to wear out faster.  </li>
<li> They are not too expensive</li>
<li> Just toss out the dirty filter and solution when it&#x27;s time.</li>
<li> Crazy.  </li>
<li> Really disappointing...</li>
<li> That way the cleaner doesn&#x27;t get dirty until a couple of years.</li>
<li> It is VERY difficult to do so without spilling some of the fluid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> the cost of gasoline and food nowadays, $5/month isn&#x27;t too bad to me.  </li>
<li> But what&#x27;s the point of buying a shaver with an automatic cleaning system, then not using it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two bits of bad news.  </li>
<li> I bought this before reading the specifics and I was really disappointed.</li>
<li> You have to pry off two plastic lids then slide the brim-full cartridge into the cleaning base.  </li>
<li> How can this be used without a base???</li>
<li> What else could I do but go ahead and pay those outrageous prices?  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Product came fast, works as advertised. Good price.</li>
    <li> Very easy to switch out great buy</li>
    <li> Arrived as expected and correctly fits my husbands Braun shaver!</li>
    <li> I wish these things did not smell like lemon dish soap, but they do keep my razor very clean. I keep pondering mixing my own solution, but I would hate to screw up my razor, which I do like very much.</li>
    <li> I am always very happy with this Braun Clean @ Renew Refills.  My husband has a shaver that needs this product and every week I do the cleaning and charging.  It does what they say.</li>
    <li> Great price buying 3) 2 packs as I did. Better than going to local Target which doesn&#x27;t carry them anymore anyway.</li>
    <li> I am pleased that this does exactly what it is supposed to do...and my shaver is always in tip-top condition being cleaned with this solution automatically.  That said, I really find it COMPLETELY unnecessary for Braun to require you to buy an entire new plastic pack to go with every refill.  I would be far more satisfied cleaning out the old one and refilling it with new solution from a simple canister. I suppose the problem here is that this solution isn&#x27;t the most environmentally friendly stuff ever...and while I&#x27;m all for destroying the world one tossed plastic pack at a time and such...I find it illogical and irritating to be getting charged for all this extra packaging every single time.  I wouldn&#x27;t mind the environmentalists getting uppity about this and demanding an improved solution and/or packaging scenario even if it inconveniences me for a few years of legal battles and then research...but I&#x27;d really like to see more thought put into this (as opposed to the technically legal, yet astoundingly stupid, means this represents).  I would rather pay the same price for something representing a higher order of thought even if the solution and materials cost me more than this plastic-packaged monstrosity.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for two years now, but there is a major failure on the system designed by brown. It often spills, even if I haven&#x27;t moved it, causing a mess on the bathroom counter. I am not even sure if it is really necessary or worth the mess it causes sometimes.</li>
    <li> The price on this item appeared to good to be true, but it came in just as described and worked perfectly!</li>
    <li> This makes shaving a little less cumbersome. The item can get a little pricey but seems to be worth the product considering the value I receive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with it.My shaver gets very dirty from shaving alot and the new cleaners always make the shaver new again...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun electric razors for a few years now.  I&#x27;ve purchased many replacement refill cartridges over that time.  I came here for the price that Amazon offers.  These replacement cartridges work as expected.  They last for about 2 to 3 months for me, but that will depend on how many times you shave per month and what setting the razor base cleans the razor.  If it uses the Intense setting, it will use the liquid more and will probably have a greater tendency to last for a shorter period of time.  All in all, I&#x27;m always happy with the consistent performance with this product.  Thanks Braun!</li>
    <li> These refills do exactly what they are supposed to do, as you can read in the product description.&lt;br /&gt;I have found no noticeable difference by cleaning my shaver every other use instead of every time.  I have owned it for almost a year now.  This is a good way to get twice the life out of the refills.  They also seem to last longer than the 30 uses stated.&lt;br /&gt;Also, these things are very easy to spill when installing.  Be careful!&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I&#x27;d recommend stocking up on them if you like the shaver because with products like these, you never know when the manufacturer will stop production thus rendering the shaver obsolete.</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to install and is cheap.  No need for me to try to combine a cocktail of fluids to get the same results, nor do i need to settle for the imitations they sell online.  Buy this item, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I have read the reviews of these replacement cartridges for a razor that, in my opinion, shaves better than a blade and the biggest gripe seemed to be the cost.  Yes, seemingly a bit pricey but, after shaving with a Mach 3 Turbo prior to this, I am certain that I spent much more in a year on blades.  This razor can be used without the &amp;quot;clean and charge&amp;quot; system but everyone seems to love that feature and wouldn&#x27;t want to give it up.  I always shaved with a blade after trying a number of electric razors; however, after being placed on the drug Coumadin, I had to go to an electric razor.  I won&#x27;t go back.  Five bucks a month for a cartridge beats at least 10 dollars a month in blades and it is much quicker and more effective.  If the cost of the razor didn&#x27;t prohibt a customer from purchasing it, why complain about 5 bucks a month.  You can still clean it with the brush if you like...</li>
    <li> Well I&#x27;ve had my 8595 for over 3 weeks now and it looks like the solution is getting pretty dirty.  If you read my review on the 8595 you&#x27;ll see I&#x27;m only cleaning it once a week and doing the reseal-the-cleaner-with-plug trick. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The solution is not evaporating as I expected, but even with all the wiskers trapped in the filter, the solution itself is getting darker.  I was hoping it would last longer, but it appears the only way to do that is to manually clean out the head before you drop it into the charger for auto-cleaning. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve given in, I just bought Qty 3 of this item... good enough for 6 months. As someone else commented earlier, you&#x27;ll basically wind up spending $60 a year using one refill per month.  That boils down to $5/month.  You have to decide if $5/month is worth your time and effort to clean your shaver (even once a week) plus knowing that the cleaning solution has removed the oil and bacteria off the head and foil to minimize infection or in-grown wiskers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Given the cost of gasoline and food nowadays, $5/month isn&#x27;t too bad to me.  BUT the refills are not eco-friendly.  If Braun would get smart and sell a refill kit which came with a quart or two of solution and replacement filters, I&#x27;d buy that.  At least you could reuse the container over and over.  Just toss out the dirty filter and solution when it&#x27;s time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I read up on all the alcohol, lemon extract, silicon oil refill tricks, but they don&#x27;t address the filter problem unless you backwash the container.  It was at that point I realized the time to rejuvenate the refill would equal the time I&#x27;d spend just to manually cleaning the head. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;BTW, it looks like Amazon has fixed the shipping problem someone noted earlier.  Each of these items can be shipped for 50 cents.  So if you ship Qty 3, it&#x27;s $1.50 for shipping, Qty 6 is $3.00, etc.  So my hats off to Amazon for reading the comments here and making the shipping reasonable.  I did my order on Amazon because it looks like on eBay, you only save about $2-$3 (depending on quantity) and some auctions claim their refills are old outdated stock.  Probably nothing wrong with that since they are sealed, but for $2, I&#x27;ll just buy here to get the fresh stock.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not a lot to say about this item.  It does what it is sold to do-keep your razor clean.  If you use it daily you will cycle through about 1 a month.  My skin is not super sensitive so it&#x27;s fine for me to wait 3-5 days between cleanings.  A refill will last me about 2 months or a little more.</li>
    <li> The price charged on Amazon for this product is half of what it costs on the retail market.I am still in awe of what you can buy at Amazon.A BARGAIN AT EVERY CLICK OF THE MOUSE.</li>
    <li> I love my Syncro Shaver and these refills are easy to install.</li>
    <li> Keeps your electric razor clean and lubricated. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it works great.</li>
    <li> This is a product that is needed to allow the shaver to funtion at it&#x27;s best ability! &lt;br /&gt;It is a necessary item that would be better off at a lower price. &lt;br /&gt;But, this is as good as any comparible offer.</li>
    <li> The good news is that since these cleaning refill cartridges are made by the manufacturer, they are an exact fit, and they work just the way the original cartridge does.  However, there are a couple of things to think about:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun&#x27;s manual says to run the cleaning cycle every day.  In reality, cleaning it every other day works just as well; I can&#x27;t detect any difference between every-day and every-other-day cleaning.  As one reviewer notes, the cleaning liquid evaporates whether or not you run the cycle, but the simple fact is that the cartridge will run out sooner if you run the cleaning cycle every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could just clean the Braun with the little cleaning brush.  But what&#x27;s the point of buying a shaver with an automatic cleaning system, then not using it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two bits of bad news.  First is the cost.  These things are very pricey; if you clean every day, and if a cartridge lasts about 30 cleanings, you&#x27;ll spend about $60 per year.  That&#x27;s just the way it goes.  You could easily pour the cheap or even home-brew cleaner of your choice into the empty cartridge, but that would be a VERY bad idea.  Whatever you put in won&#x27;t have the lubricants that the factory liquid does, and that will cause your replaceable but expensive cutter head to wear out faster.  In addition, some cleaners would probably damage the machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another bit of bad news is the mess.  You have to pry off two plastic lids then slide the brim-full cartridge into the cleaning base.  It is VERY difficult to do so without spilling some of the fluid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said all of that, though, the fact is that if you want to use the Braun shaver to its full potential, you have to buy these cartridges.  Life is like that sometimes...</li>
    <li> I ordered 4 of these. All arrived quickly with each in a separate oversized box. All 4 could have easily fit into just one of these boxes. I hope they can keep prices low and shipping free with this inefficiency.</li>
    <li> The product is great but the service was awful.  I ordered a quantity of three refills and the company packed each refill separately and charged me $15.41 each time instead of packaging together with one shipping charge.  Will never order from them again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for quite some time now, but not at this price.  What a great value!!</li>
    <li> Much as I enjoyed the thorough cleaning and fresh lemon scent, don&#x27;t believe the hype about \\&quot;special cleaning agents\\&quot; and \\&quot;blade lubricants\\&quot;; these cartridges don&#x27;t contain either.  Want proof?  Just read the cartridge packaging, each contains nothing but denatured alcohol and \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot;.    So save yourself a bunch of money and to to OSH or any quality hardware store. Buy a quart of Klean-Strip S-L-X Denatured Alcohol for less than $5, and every month or so shake the old dirty alcohol out of the SMALL HOLE and refill through the LARGE HOLE.  That way the bits of hair come out and the fresh alcohol rinses the filter clean.  I&#x27;ve been doing this for about two years and it works great.  Or, buy the Braun Refills if you think the lemon fragrance is worth $10 a month...</li>
    <li> I have been using this type of product for years and it does work, although quite expensive for some alcohol and a little oil. I haven&#x27;t found anything else so I guess that it&#x27;s the only game in town. (Does anyone know of another less expensive product?) Nevertheless I keep using it because it really does do a good cleaning and lube job on the shaver.</li>
    <li> Product works as advertised. I have an ongoing Amazon order, which also works well. I don&#x27;t have to try to remember to order a replacement every two months for my son and I.</li>
    <li> The clean and renew cartridges function flawlessly - though they go quick.  It would be nice if there was more of a cycle so you did not have to purchase them so often.</li>
    <li> My order arrived ontime, however, one of the product boxes was taped with double side tape, one was from an older stock and appeared to have been wet from setting in water at some time.  The price was good and I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> The Braun razor was a Xmas gift from my Mother to my son. He had already had one and it lasted about five years. It was used a lot since he has a heavy beard and he traveled a great deal. He liked it so well, he asked for a new one this Xmas. Seems to be happy with it. Was not particularly happy with the UPS delivery. Had to call Amazon and part of it had to be delivered to his work address because they did not deliver after dark. They are not the most reliable delivery service but sometimes all one can afford.</li>
    <li> These are the typical refills I have been using for a long time. I could get a good deal on this one by registering for \\&quot;subscribe &amp; save\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> These braun refill packages last a while if you take precautions to do so.  My technique is that I always put the cap back on after the cleaning process.  I also use the brush that came with my razor and clean off anything I can before putting it in for a cleaning.  This helps these last for longer than a month.  Otherwise, if you just leave the top open it will evaporate in a month whether you use it or not.</li>
    <li> They fit cleaning unit and work fine</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d never buy these things, I mean, why buy these expensive refills when you can just clean your shaver yourself.  However, I&#x27;m starting to use them regularly.  I&#x27;m finding it more convenient to use the cleaning system as it charges and cleans at the same time and requires less effort than cleaning the shaver manually.  Now, if only I could figure out a way to prevent those millions of little hairs from falling out of my shaver onto my bathroom sink each time I shave.  Not sure how often others change the refills, but I use the cleaning system about once a week and change the refills about once a month.</li>
    <li> I received this product in a timely manner, and in perfect condition.To preserve the life of these refill cartridges I highly suggest to pop off the top of shaver and brush out loose hair trimmings before you have the auto clean do it&#x27;s job. Also only use auto clean once or twice a week, this system works great for me.</li>
    <li> As far as I am concerned it&#x27;s one of the benefits of the Braun shaver. The product works as it is supposed to. It is a very convenient way to clean and lubricate the shaving head. Definitely the right way to maintain a shaver. It has a reasonable cartridge life and I enjoy the shaving results after using the cartridge.</li>
    <li> like the other braun products this is also very good quality and durable. fast shipping and will reorder it later especially with such good price ($7.30).</li>
    <li> Braun Clean &amp; Renew Refills seem adequate in performance.  However, since there is no competitive commercial product available to my knowledge, an objective comparison isn&#x27;t possible.  The main criticism is the price charged - it is ridiculously overpriced.  Braun ought to offer refills for the plastic fluid containers and design them to be easily cleaned and refilled.</li>
    <li> This product is used to clean and lubricate your Braun electric razors. They are reasonably priced and last a good amount of time. They have a lemon-alcohol kind of scent to them which I have grown to really like. These really work too. Sometimes when I don&#x27;t get a chance to order extras and don&#x27;t clean my razor for a few days I can really feel the difference. Shaving is much more painful because the razor starts to pull your hair more instead of clipping it.     Don&#x27;t get too complacent through. I would still recommend occasionally taking a brush and air can to the razor to get it extra clean.</li>
    <li> They are good at properly cleaning the blades and filtering out the dead, shaved skin cells as well. It also leaves a fresh &amp; clean smell. You dont have to use it every time after you shave. I use it once a week.</li>
    <li> As soon as I refilled and used the product it works like brand-new again. Amazing.</li>
    <li> Product works great, I need it to clean my Braun Shaver.  I can&#x27;t seem to find this product at my local store so I am glad Amazon stocks it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my Electric Shaver and it is good.  It is just the refills, but I have no problems with it and it cleans my shaver 100%.</li>
    <li> OK, so are you one of those people who would just rather not spend any time cleaning your electric razor?  I am, and since I started using the Braun Clean and Renew refills, I have learned  how easy cleaning a razor could be!  Also, I do enjoy the fresh lime smell of the fluid used in the process.  All in all, a very easy and simple way to keep your blades clean and sharp, and ready to use whenever the beard calls.</li>
    <li> A very convenient method of cleaning.  I believe that using the Braun cleaning system not only cleans&#x60;and lubricates the shaver, but using it after each shaving prolongs the life of the cutter blades,</li>
    <li> Received what was offered great deal</li>
    <li> A must have for Braun shaver systems, this item was on sale at the time of purchase.  I received this item on time and in good condition.</li>
    <li> Cleaner arrived in good time and was cheaper than at any store.  Was expected. I bought multiple packs and would buy again.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use refills.  Just remove the old one and put the new one in.  The refills are a little pricey, but the shaver is well worth it.  The self-cleaning unit makes regular upkeep a piece of cake.</li>
    <li> There were two things I always disliked about electric shavers: they didn&#x27;t cut close as a blade, and they required regular cleaning with that annoying little brush. The new Braun shaver, which I&#x27;ve reviewed also, is an excellent device, and the shave is quite comparable to a blade. This handy little item, of course, solves my other pet peeve, the claeaning part. Every morning when I finish shaving, I just put the shaver in the attachment, and it does its magic. No muss, no fuss, and no little brush! The next morning the shaver is ready for use again, and there&#x27;s a pleasant lemony smell to it, which I like. As long as I can continue to get these refills (and they tend to be hard to find at times), I will continue to use this shaver, and continue to love it.</li>
    <li> I have had my Syncro Shaver System for about a year now and love it.  Like all the rest these refills are a bit pricey.  I stretch them by not cleaning eveyday and I refill ea cartridge 2x before replaceing.  I have found that the green rubbing alcohol works great!  It contains oils and a fragrance. &lt;br /&gt;4 stars because of cost and Braun&#x27;s locking out aftermarket suppliers (jeeze do they think they are HP!)</li>
    <li> 3 years,  bought a second shaver and alternate them when they &lt;br /&gt;run out of juice, to prolong the battery life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;just pay for the cleaners, and use them. &lt;br /&gt;my wife no longer complains about hair in the sink.</li>
    <li> These are what helps make the razor what it is.  A cheap solution to keep the blade clean for every shave and it&#x27;s almost completly automated.  Well worth the less than $9 it costs to get a set of these.</li>
    <li> Good fast service, product is manufacturer quality, only thing missing is external packaging which is not needed for this type of product.</li>
    <li> I started using Braun 8000 series shaver for over 3 months now. This is the first time I&#x27;ve replaced the cleaning fluid since mid. December. I have to say this shaver works great! The best thing is your shaver feels renew after each clean. Besides cleaning your shaver it also lubricates your shaver&#x27;s mechanical parts after each clean, which extend the life of your shaver&#x27;s blade. With regards to the cleaning solution performance it work just as stated. Although it stated that you have to clean it after every shaves. But I think it is ok to clean it base on your preference. I am very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> what I was looking for from long time</li>
    <li> Thia ia not a review, but an observation of the peoploe who are trying to find a formula to cheat the cost of a refill. &lt;br /&gt;First of all, read the label on the refill!  It clearly states that it is denatured alcohol!  That ia not rubbing alcohol...it is readily available at most hardware stores, but is far more expensive tthere than to buy these refills! &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like buying  a Hummer, and then complaining about gas prices!  Must be democrats!</li>
    <li> I have had quite a few Braun electric shavers over the years, and this one is the best.  It is smoother than previous models and I love the self-cleaning feature.  Sure, you have to buy cartridges of cleaning solution, but I&#x27;m lazy, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> I have owned a Braun 8595 shaving system for about a year and am well pleased with its performance and value.  I also own a Norelco Quadra electric shaver and it works well also but I perfer the Braun.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With the Braun system, you need to purchase the Clean &amp; Renew refills and change them about every 2 months. (I run the clean cycle about every other shave).  The shaver stays clean and fresh.  There is a cost to this cleaning system but I think it&#x27;s worth it. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Without this cleaning solution for your Braun 85xx series shaver you&#x27;ll have to clean it by hand with the brush. It&#x27;s easier to let the machine do the work with the cleaning solution. The cleaning solution lasts about 3 months so you&#x27;ll need to stock up on these&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that if you leave the shaver alone for a long time the liquid evaporates.  I have learned that you can cap the cleaning solution and it lasts longer.</li>
    <li> Product was good, but felt like I was paying a subscription fee for using my razor Braun. I&#x27;m much happier now with my Norelco razor. Free usage. The Braun razor was quite loud as well.</li>
    <li> Normally I&#x27;d be at Target or Wal-Mart purchasing these but when it&#x27;s at your door two days after ordering for free. I cant beat that price. Anyone with a self cleaning Braun knows these aren&#x27;t essential but they definitely do the job they&#x27;re made for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying the two cartridge refill set - CCR2 - at retail from Bed Bath and Beyond for $9.99 throughout the year.  What&#x27;s all this about &amp;quot;saving&amp;quot; $10.00?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a Braun Syncro for about a year and a half now.  It&#x27;s the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had without cutting myself, and that includes the new triple blades.  But those refills are pricey.  Another Amazon review gave me a clue as to how to make each cartridge last six months.  Here&#x27;s how:  Clean your razor once a week instead of every day.  Between cleans, remove the cartridge from the cleaning machine and reseal the cartridge with the original plastic tab.  No more evaporation problem.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I typically use the cleaning solution twice a week; once on a Monday after a &#x27;heavy shave&#x27; (I can&#x27;t be bothered shaving at the weekend!) and once at the end of the week.  Anything more than that is unecessary, I find. &lt;br /&gt;But when you do use it - oooh that next shave feels so good and smells fresh.  It&#x27;s like using a new shaver.  So why don&#x27;t I use it every day?  I don&#x27;t think its worth the money - these things aren&#x27;t cheap and, rather disappointingly, I&#x27;m not a millionaire, so having the &#x27;new shaver&#x27; feel every day isn&#x27;t justified. &lt;br /&gt;And another tip: if you can be bothered, you can remove the solution after each use and re-plug it to avoid evaporation of the solution - which makes it last even longer.  But that&#x27;s all a bit too much effort for me...! &lt;br /&gt;So, Braun - stop charging so much for a simple alcohol solution and design the cleaner to automatically &#x27;plug&#x27; the solution when its not in use to prevent evaporation, and you&#x27;ll earn that last star! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Happy shopping &lt;br /&gt;JB</li>
    <li> I just placed an order for these as part of a larger order.  When I looked at my shopping cart I saw that not only does this item not qualify for SuperSaver shipping, but it is back ordered into April (over a month), and the shipping charges are over $11.00 on a $7.99 item.  At almost $19.00 and a months wait, no thank you.</li>
    <li> Great price! My Braun is an older unit, but performs like new when you use&lt;br /&gt;these cartridges.</li>
    <li> I got these Clean and Renew refills for my Braun shaver.  They work.  What more can I say?  This was the best price I could find at the time of purchase, but I recommend you shop around, including locally.  Prices for this item vary greatly between retailers.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re good... but they evaporate kinda fast. Shaving with a clean razor everyday spoils you... (you get used to is fast) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I have used the Braun CCR2 Syncro Shaver System for about 6 motnhs and they are just great. They totally take away the hassle of having to fix and clean your shaver and they do a great job at it. I just pop in my shaver in its socket every morning and let it do its job, and it is always perfect. Sure, it is a bit pricey, but worth the money if you value your time.</li>
    <li> These are excellent products, and they are priced at Amazon lower than I can find anywhere else.</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with the great idea of self-cleaning. Make your shaver as good a a brand new ones each time. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> My grocery store charges $20 for a two-pack of these cleaners.  Amazon offers a much better price.  I extend the life of each cartridge by filling it up with rubbing alcohol once it runs out.  I do this two times, then it&#x27;s time to replace the cartridge.  There is a filter built into the part of the cartridge where the cleaning fluid is sucked up by the Braun cleaning machine, so after refilling the cartridge 2 times, the filter gets clogged.</li>
    <li> I like the Braun shaver and overall the cleaning system is what it is supposed to be.  The refills are a little pricey and I have found that alcohol works as well - without the nice smell however. Does it really matter if your shaver smells good?</li>
    <li> I like the idea of using a clean shaver everyday. This is one of my must-have items.</li>
    <li> I got the first generation Syncro shaver cleaning systems when they first came out. I am glad the refill cartridges are the same for the second generation systems. The second generation systems are intelligent enough to automatically decide how intense a cleanning session your shaver needs. I think this also helps conserve the amount of cleaning fluid is used. Another way to make it last longer is not to clean your shaver after every use, but rather just once or twice a week. In between cleanings, or before extended absences, I pull out the refill cartridge and seal it to keep the fluid from evaporating while it is just sitting there. So make sure to save the cap so that you can reseal the cartridge!</li>
    <li> I have used these cartridges for a number of years and they have always worked well.</li>
    <li> We are pleased to receive this product and it has extended the life of the expensive shaver.</li>
    <li> Great price and they keep my razor working great.  I would recommend these to anyone that could use them and the price was right.</li>
    <li> Came as described in a box of 2.</li>
    <li> I had looked all over both in town and out of town for these refills for the Razor my wife purchased me for my birthday.  I&#x27;d had no luck anywhere, it seems you can buy the Razor but not the refills anywhere.  Then I tried ordering from Wal-mart.com and Walgreens.com but they both wouldn&#x27;t or couldn&#x27;t ship after I had ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally Amazon came to the rescue and I am delighted to finally be able to clean my razor again.</li>
    <li> seem to be original Worked fine</li>
    <li> I like this system but I don&#x27;t understand what the previous reviewer meant by &amp;quot;great price&amp;quot;. It is the same price as it is at all stores and online sites where I have seen it.</li>
    <li> I find the braun shaver I bought to be quite good if I shave everyday rather than let my beard grow and cleanup is easier with this system. I suggest keeping the cap that comes with the solution so you can put it back on the solution refill to make it last longer. If you don&#x27;t, the alcohol just evaporates.</li>
    <li> It was here in 1 day (i paid for 5 day delivery)....as is...satisfied to the fullest.   &lt;br /&gt;cheap as can be too</li>
    <li> The best thing about the CCR2 clean &amp; charge refills isn&#x27;t the product itself but the product that it&#x27;s used with. The Braun Synchro shaver is a wonderful product that I&#x27;ve been using for over 3 years. The refills are a small price to pay for the convenience of not having to open up your shaver every day to clean out the hairs.</li>
    <li> Great pricing on the \\&quot;auto-ship\\&quot; option for this, hopefully I picked the correct term, 2-pack every 6 months, I clean it every time and do that twice a week.</li>
    <li> The Clean &amp; Renew System is a very useful feature, and these refills are required to use it.  They work great and have a tolerable smell.  I own a Braun Series 7 and use the Clean &amp; Renew feature every other time I shave.  It saves fluid and the shaver still keeps clean using this method.</li>
    <li> I received the Braun clean and renew packet with no base.  How can this be used without a base???</li>
    <li> Same with this product....</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t much more to say. If you have a Braun shaver that self-cleans, you basically have to get these. As a pro though, each refill does last quite a while - so no complaints.</li>
    <li> The refills are not ultra cheap but neither is the razor.  Is there any sense in buying a razor which is cleanable if you&#x27;re going to cheap out on the cleaner?  I&#x27;m getting about 2+ months of use out of each refill.  I have no complaints whatsoever.  After cleaning-- the razor smells and operates like the first time I took it out of the box.  You wouldn&#x27;t put cheap tires on a race car would you?  Same logic.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Keeps your shaver clean and fresh.  No more cleaning of shaver heads.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these Braun cleaning solution units since I bought this razor 6 years ago. My razor cuts like it&#x27;s still brand new and I&#x27;m sure the regular use of this fluid has helped. They keep my shaver clean and oiled.  The order was handled and shipped fine.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t feel like cleaning my razor after a shave.  I know, it would involve running the razor underwater and shaking it off.  Crazy.  Still, one of the things I hated about shaving with a traditional manual razor was getting my hands wet, and having trails of water run up my forearm, or under my collar.  Sometimes I just don&#x27;t want to touch water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, these refills do a decent job of the cleaning the razor for me.  Now, the razor seems to catch a good deal of the shaved whiskers, but many fall onto the sink or floor.  In any event, regardless of the actual congestion of the foil razor after shave, these cleaning cartridges do a fine job a rinsing them away.  Also, my razor unit indicates that an \\&quot;Eco\\&quot; clean is needed after one shave, so I only clean the razor every two shaves.  I love the lemon scent.  These do, however, make the area around them smell like alcohol during and after cleaning so if you are sensitive, be forewarned.  With the subscribe and save discount, I am pleased with these, even though I am not completely convinced they do a thorough cleaning.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 boxes or the Braun CCR2 Syncro Shaver System Clean &amp; Renew Refills.  When the shipment arrived, one box was leaking.  I have determined that there is no way to return this item due to shipment requirements.  So there is no recourse be to discard the package and loose the money.</li>
    <li> Excellent product to clean a top of the line shaver. Although the refills are expensive, they do keep the Braun shaver clean, sanitary and running like new. On trips ,I just wash the shaver head out with water but the cleaning cartridge is better for the shaver in daily use.</li>
    <li> Totally satisfied with product. I had read some mixed views on this (from other sources) I didn&#x27;t understand. Works perfectly and smells great. I would be more than glad to recommend this item!!!</li>
    <li> Despite slightly pricey, still cheaper than a wet razor, shaving cream, etc. with better results.  So convenient, worth it.</li>
    <li> So far, no problems with these units.  I finally had a chance to use one when the cartridge that originally came with the unit went dry.  Easy to install, and they do the job.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price and 2 day shipping - whats not to like</li>
    <li> This product seems to do the job.  However, I think it&#x27;s a rip-off.  Having to pay inflated prices for the fluid and container.  There shoud be a way to obtain the fluid in bulk at a much reduced price would make the product much more attractive.  I must have thrown away 20-30 containers which could easily be washed out and refilled with the cleaner.  Youngbern@aol.com</li>
    <li> Needed these to replace my old ones</li>
    <li> Yep, a product I have to buy in order to clean my electric razor. Smart idea for Braun to make a product that will keep bringing money in until the product breaks. Of course I bought the Braun electric razor knowing I would have to buy the cleaner. As for the cleaner. It does what it is suppose to, which is to clean the Braun razor. It leaves it lemony fresh.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just a refill made by the manufacturer of a product. Better fit and do the job right. The price is great.</li>
    <li> These items are mandatory when using the Braun shaver. They do and good shop of cleaning and bathing the shaver and leave it smelling very  nice.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t HAVE to use the cleaning function of the Braun.  You can use it like any other shaver and clean it with a brush.  But if you don&#x27;t mind paying ~$60/year on these refills, then the cleaning system works great.  I hope eventually someone decides to make generic versions of the refills or sells the fluid only so we can refill them (like they do with inkjet printer cartridges).  I would NOT take the advice of the guy who recommended using alcohol and lemon juice as a refilling liquid.  Lemon has sugar (and other impurities) in it, and alcohol doesn&#x27;t have lubricating agents and may strip the lubricating that the blades need.      Cleaning every other day may seem like a money-saving idea, but I have found that even if you don&#x27;t use it for weeks, the cleaning fluid still evaporates and you have to replace it almost as frequently, so I figure I might as well get the benefit of cleaning rather than let the stuff just evaporate away.    I hope Amazon starts selling these things directly since buying it from J&amp;R is not a good deal because of the shipping charges.  Instead, go to Walgreens or some other store that sells the shaver system, and buy it there.  BestBuy.com sells it for the same price with free shipping.  J&amp;R&#x27;s prices are regular street prices (not 50% off).</li>
    <li> This is cleaning solution for the Braun 7000 series.      Since I only clean the shaver only two or three times a month, the solution that came with the shaver lasted one year.  You do not have to clean the shaver after every use as long as you take the head off and blow the stubble off...that is what I do.      The solution was easy to install, has a nice odor, and does a good job cleaning the shaver.    However, word of caution, do not take the shaver out of the base before the cleaning process is done or you will have a wet, dripping mess.  You will have to wipe off the shaver and the counter before you shave.</li>
    <li> This stuff keeps my electric razor nice and clean.  The lemony smell is present, and the razor head is still pristine a month later.  If I travel for a few days without the base to clean the razor, I&#x27;m more likely to get razor burn on my face and neck.  After a good cleaning cycle, the razor works like it&#x27;s brand new!  Given the choice, I&#x27;d rather use the cleaner every day instead of less frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why people are trying their darndest to conserve the refills.  Braun expects them to last about 30 days.  My charging base still says \\&quot;Full\\&quot; and about 3/4 of the liquid is left. Hopefully I will get 2 or 3 more weeks from it since the \\&quot;Half\\&quot; light hasn&#x27;t come on yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d probably spend as much in Mach 3 Turbo blades and shaving gel over the time I expect the cleaner to last.  When I factor in the convenience of the electric razor and benefits of keeping it clean, this seems like a great product for me.</li>
    <li> Why go to a shaver store spend time and gas looking for this item when you can get it at Amazon.com for the same or cheaper price delivered to your door!!</li>
    <li> most of the annoyance of owning an electric razor is cleaning it, but this takes the work of cleaning and makes it a simple task.  it oils and cleans the razor all at once.  i love sloth!  &lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> This razor makes my husband face smooth and fabulous. Easy to use and small in sace.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m still not convinced of the proper attitude to have toward this whole system that braun has to clean my razor everyday - is it a great way to maintain my razor and get a superior shave, or is it expensive overkill? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;for the time being, i am using the system as it has been designed - cleaning everyday.  the refills last about a month and are very easy to replace.  i do have a clean razor to use every morning and i don&#x27;t have to \\&quot;fuss\\&quot; with the razor stubble in any way.</li>
    <li> This is a great place to purchase the claner if you own the razor &lt;br /&gt;Shipment was swift. I&#x27;m very happy</li>
    <li> Product is original manufacturer&#x27;s replacement for Braun Clean &amp; Renew Electric Razors - A necessity for all such razors.  It is exactly as described in the product description.</li>
    <li> My husband is pleased with the refills -- they work well. He really likes the razor -- very much!</li>
    <li> This product have been chosen for me because permit effortless good shaving and it&#x27;s a very good help for arthritical people.</li>
    <li> I love these clean and renew cartridges. They make the shaver feel new each time I use it, and there is a light lemon scent that helps invigorate me each morning.    Since the fluid evaporates, you might as well use it as much as you want. If you try to stretch the product by using it less, you just end up paying for vapor. I try to use it after each shave. Also, I signed up for the subscription to get it shipped for free, and am so happy with not having to worry about buying it. Just about the time that I need a new one, there is a package waiting at my front door!</li>
    <li> Factory replacement for the original cleaning solution. Does what its supposed to with that nice lemony fresh scent. Nice that it was the same price as in store without the hassle of having to go into a store!</li>
    <li> Not much that I can say other than the price of these is much better on Amazon so I get them here. The product works great and keeps my razor in top condition. The only thing I have noticed is that once a razor is a few years old I think the product starts to wear the painting / coating on the plastic. Mine razor has started to discolor a little as well as bubble / peel near the area the cleaner hits. Really this is a non-issue, most razors I have had that cost well over $200 dont even seem to last that long, just figured I would mention it. Not much you can do really, you have to clean the razors and these cartridges are what most require in some form.</li>
    <li> love having a clean razor when I shave and these Braun cleaners work great. I love getting them from Amazon because they are cheaper and they come quickly. It is so much easier ordering from Amazon than going to the store</li>
    <li> Make the blades cut smoother, and smell fresh.</li>
    <li> Very fast service. I&#x27;d use them again!</li>
    <li> It is indeed a great razor as others have mentioned.  However the price of the refills is amazingly high.  It&#x27;s a hunk of plastic filled with alcohol and a touch of fragrance.  Worth a few bucks at the most.  They already comand a pretty good price for the razor.  At 5 bucks or more a cartridge that last a matter of a couple of weeks that&#x27;s too much.  Manufacturers need to be a little more reasonable when they sell a product that requires a fairly frequent replacement.  Four and a half stars for the razor.  One and a half for the alcolol &#x3D; 3 stars.</li>
    <li> Item is necessary in order to keep your shaver operating as new.  Don&#x27;t shortcut with trying to refill your used containers as some do and the shaver will reward you.</li>
    <li> Item received in good condition and on time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Braun 7526 shaver and cleaning stand for 5+ years, and have found it to be the best balance of close shave with minimal irritation. I work in a chemistry lab so anytime I have a device that uses a \\&quot;solution\\&quot; I try to think how I can mimic it and save money and time. I make my own aftershave lotion by mixing rubbing alcohol + baby oil + water, mostly alcohol (17 parts), oil (3 parts), water (1 part), more oil if you want your skin to be softer, but it will shine. Shake well before each use. For the Braun cleaning solution, be aware that the red light comes on due to the level dropping low; it has nothing to do with the amount of hair debris in the solution. Dump the remaining solution; add water through the small hole and shake well to get as much of the hair debris out of the container. I use two ingredients in the solution: rubbing alcohol and finger nail polish remover (non-drying lemon scented). The volume of the solution is a little less than 6 ounces, but I make a mark on the side using a Sharpie when the container is new, and just fill to that level each time. Just add a couple ounces alcohol through the small hole (I got a small funnel at a hobby store), add a tablespoon (15 mL) of polish remover, slosh to mix, then add alcohol to the mark being sure the container is on a level surface. You can try to mix or let the shaver mix it when it recirculates. The polish remover is good at removing the oils left on the cutter/foil, and the non-drying formula leaves a trace of oily ingredient that seems to help lube the shaver as well. Use at your own risk.</li>
    <li> I think your product is great. It gives a very close shave, especially if used every day..my only compaint is the exorbitant price of shipping refills. $15.00 shipping for 2 refills is really too much.</li>
    <li> I used to replace these cleaning cartridges once every 3 weeks and was spending a small fortune on them ... until I learned how to extend their usable life.  1. After shaving, pop off the screen and rinse it under running water. Without removing the cutter, rinse it, too. Replace the screen firmly and put the shaver into the cradle for cleaning right away. The alcohol in the fluid removes most of the tap water preventing corrosion of the shaver. By removing most of the debris, the fluid stays clean for 3 months.  2. The fluid in the cartridge slowly evaporates but the lubricant does not. When the indicator light on the cradle shows low fluid level, top the cartridge off with rubbing alcohol - 70% isopropyl - readily available at every pharmacy.  I&#x27;ve been doing this for 3 years and have not seen any damage to the shaver, the cardle, or most importantly to my skin.</li>
    <li> works great,have used this for over 12 years</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Having the auto-ship option from Amazon means that my husband never runs out. This is one less thing I have to remember. The self cleaning shaver is the best idea since sliced bread. People don&#x27;t take care of things like they used to and this is one thing that takes care of itself.</li>
    <li> Has anyone figured out how to refill these cartridges yourself?  It appears to just be alchohol with a little oil, but I wonder who has figured it out more acurately.</li>
    <li> Over my lifetime I have had several other brands of electric shavers that provided &#x27;acceptable&#x27; shaving closeness and lasting ability of the non-replaceable battery.  It was time for yet another razor as my Remington&#x27;s battery had finally died.&lt;br /&gt;This was several years ago when I first saw the &lt;b&gt;Braun 7525 Syncro Shaver System with Clean &amp; Charge Refills&lt;/b&gt;, I had to purchase it right on the spot.&lt;br /&gt;My first save with my new Braun Syncro Shaving System was the very best I had ever had with an electric shaver.  But I wondered, \\&quot;How long with this cutter provide a terrific result before it would be time to replace the cutting system\\&quot;.  Would the foil last a month, three months ore have to be replaced every six months to a year?  Four months later I was still getting the same level of closeness as the very firsts have.  This is because the tiny hairs, dirt, and facial grease are never allowed to clog the pours in the foil or the cutter. &lt;br /&gt;One week passed and I realized that I was HOOKED on the built-in cleaning feature.  As life would have it, the solution ran out, now was time to replace the cleaning cartridge.  &lt;b&gt;OUCH&lt;/b&gt;, these things are expensive!&lt;br /&gt;At these prices, a solution had to be found so that I (everyone) could stay out of the poor house.  So I started to look for discount and generic cartridges in stores and over the Internet with no such luck.  What else could I do but go ahead and pay those outrageous prices?  NO.  So I kept look for another solution to the problem at hand.  It did not take long to figure out how to refill the cartridge thus saving me money!  Below is the Easy Eight Step System to saving money you need to look inside the cartridge to see how much dirt, grease, and hair is in there.  Do this by taking the cartridge out of the cleaning station and then look through the holes on the top of the cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;If the cartridge if completely full of hair and dirt, most likely you will have no option but to purchase a new cartridge. Of course, you could try the following steps and maybe you will gain some additional use before a replacement becomes required. poor any remaining solution down the sink by gently shaking the cartridge several ways. Don&#x27;t rofget to protect your eyes when doing this. fill the cartridge with some warm water. It is best to use purified or reverse osmosis water, found in many stores for a dollar or so.  USE WATER ONLY, gently swish the water back and forth for a few minutes.  This will remove most of the facial grease and loosen the hair attached to the sponge-like dirt collector at the bottom of the cartridge&lt;BR&gt;, poor the water from the cartridge down the sink drain.  Inspect the dirt collector to decide if additional cleaning with water is needed.  Do this until you are satisfied with the level of cleanliness or conclude only a new replacement cartridge in needed. NEVER use anything other that water to clean the dirt collector&lt;BR&gt;, Once cleaned, shake the cartridge to remove any remaining water from inside.  Put the cartridge upside-down on a folded paper towel and let the cartridge sit for a few hours.  Then turn the cartridge upside right and let sit for a day or two until full dry on the inside&lt;BR&gt;, Fill the dry cleaning cartridge with Isopropyl alcohol between ¨ø and ¨ú up to the top. If you wish you cn add a few drops of real lemon juice to cover the smell of the alcohol and possible aid in the dissolving of facial grease Step Eight and Final Step. Place the cleaned and refilled cleaning cartridge in to the cleaning station and start using and enjoying the savings.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps everyone as this refilling method may become our only option should Braun discontinue the offering of new cleaning cartridges. Let&#x27;s hope not!&lt;br /&gt;I wish you many more close, clean,and comfortable shaves using your Braun Syncro Shaver System. ----Michael, Florida, USA&lt;br /&gt;PS:  I do not work for Braun nor do I know any persons that work for the company.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/left&gt;</li>
    <li> I make the cleaner last longer by removing and re-capping it.  I only clean when I charge the battery, about once every 1 - 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Braun CCR2 Syncro Shaver and its cleaning system for my boyfriend.  He is one of the most lazy guys on earth about shaving and NEVER (ok - almost never) cleans his shaver.  With a touch of a button I can go into the bathroom and clean the thing, which helps keep all the hair off the sink and counter.  Although it does smell a bit like alcohol while it is doing its thing, the smell does not last long, and does not linger. I have also tried the shaver on my legs and it works beautifully.  This system is perfect for lazy people, and it does get the shaver much cleaner then running it under water.</li>
    <li> I purchased these refills along with the Braun Syncro Shaver for my husband.  The refills themselves are decently priced (compared to buying them in a store like Walmart).  My husband only shaves every other day, so the refills do last twice as lone - up to 2 months!</li>
    <li> This razor has worked well and the refills were a great price. At the time of purchase, it was the cheapest I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> If you bought one of the Braun shavers... These cleaning solutions &lt;br /&gt;are a must have.... Like the other reviews, the shaver feels brand new after each cleaning. \\&quot;A MUST HAVE\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I have 3 Brauns and one face. The 8000 series are the Boss. The cleaning system needs a cheat. I am a backyard chemist and the isopropyl cheat is not the thing, the silicone and the lemon will separate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By smell it is methanol (lavatol) and some ionic oil (ChOh soluble oil) and a chemical marker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need a chemist to do a IR or a Mass Spec on the liquid and email me or tell me what the peeks are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MemphisRoadKill</li>
    <li> My husband asked for a better quality electric shaver.  He loves it and the refills that are available make cleaning so easy.  Great product all round.</li>
    <li> it was easy to find refills for my braun ccr2 syncro shaver at amazon.com. price was good and service was quick.</li>
    <li> This Cleaning system was designed to preserve the micro fine \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; on the razor&#x27;s blades. Skin acids and oils, if left to linger on the razor&#x27;s edge, will eat away the micro fine teeth that give us such a close shave. When those teeth are gone the razor and so is your close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can thwart this but at the end of the day it&#x27;s your razor and face that will pay.</li>
    <li> Works great with my Braun cleaning unit.  I must have for these model electric shavers.</li>
    <li> Based on the pictures on Amazon&#x27;s web site, I was expecting to receive an unboxed item, but the refills were in its original retail packaging.  I was very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> thank you very much it helped me very much and fast safe delivery will definitly use this again especially when i have to refill</li>
    <li> This product is the cleaning solution for my Braun electric razor (which is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned).  The price on the product was excellent, and it arrived at my front door promptly.</li>
    <li> It was perfect and did the job just right. It came on time n in great condition. Ill be ordering again from the same person when I run out.</li>
    <li> They work great.&lt;br /&gt;I love Braun Clean &amp; Renew merchandise product items.&lt;br /&gt;They are what I needed for my razor</li>
    <li> repeat item works well</li>
    <li> They are the cartridges to clean the Brun shaver. Work same as the store bought.</li>
    <li> No need to describe - just works perfectly and worth the money when you buy in bulk and consider the time savings.</li>
    <li> Works well, but if you let the hottest tap water flow over the head it accomplishes the same purpose. These are the first cartridges I&#x27;ve purchased in months. Just thought it may like a &amp;#34;Braun&amp;#34; cleaning.</li>
    <li> A great invention, this is a wonderful product. I don&#x27;t think husband could live without it now.  :-)</li>
    <li> Could not be easier to order and receive.  Good prices also.  FDA</li>
    <li> For what appears to be a plastic tub full of alcohol (and blue dye) I think these should be cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it keeps my husbands razor clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He only runs it 1-2 times per week as he often travels and brings the razor with him, so the cartridges last us longer than most people.</li>
    <li> Much needed cleaning cartridges for Braun shaver.  Need to clean every week for best shaving, so they don&#x27;t last long.  Good price.</li>
    <li> easy item to use.. now it makes everything so useful I think everyone should one one these also its a great gift.</li>
    <li> Third one over many years.</li>
    <li> Before I switched to the Activator, used to bathe my Braun foil and cutter in alcohol after every use.  It&#x27;s amazing how much bacteria-attracting goop can collect in an electric razor, even if you brush it clean daily.  Cleaning daily with alcohol helped clear up my skin, but was time-consuming. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Using the clean &amp; shave system saves me time, but costs more.  I found that the first cartridge I used lasted nearly 60 days even with everyday cleaning.  After 45 days or so, the fluid started to darken and by about 60 days, it was too full of debris to continue to use in good conscience.  I now change every 30 days, even if there is fluid remaining.</li>
    <li> Not exactly new.  My grandfather had a similar, but separate appliance for a Remington.  This is more convenient.</li>
    <li> This refill arrived very quickly and exactly as expected.  I plan to purchase my refills this way again.</li>
    <li> this is a simple refill, easy in and easy out. also has a interesting smell (fruit and loops). I think its overpriced but what can you do.</li>
    <li> The item arrived on time and as advertised!  Great seller.  :-)</li>
    <li> There is not much about this refill product you can say much except that it does keep your Braun nice &amp; clean and ready for the next run. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor because I had a tendency to not clean my razor regularly, which led to whiskers on my white dress shirt in the car.(I know I shouldn&#x27;t shave in the car...) I run the cleaning cycle every 3 days and that&#x27;s enough for me. Great Amazon price!</li>
    <li> Works great. The only reservation is that it does not last long.</li>
    <li> Seems to work OK. Still on my first cartridge.</li>
    <li> You can go online and make your own cleaning solution using an empty Braun cleaning solution cartridge. The home made solution worked fine.</li>
    <li> Keeps my shaver clean and also maintains the foil blades quite nicely. Recommended for peak performance.</li>
    <li> If you have a Braun Electric Razor with Cleaning Station, these are a must to keep it clean and fully charged with no trouble.</li>
    <li> Once again I have replaced my Braun Clean &amp; Renew 2 Cartridges for my shaver, when I stretched the past cartridges as long as possible.  They go low and then I pour the remains in another partially filled cartridge for as long as I think the solution is not too used and dirty.  It is nice to start fresh with new clean solution. I like buying two in one order, just paying for them is a pain.  I feel they could be less expensive.</li>
    <li> Just a add on for the shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hooked on the convenience of this cleaner.</li>
    <li> Another great product from Braun !</li>
    <li> Does a good job of cleaning, but is a little expensive for the amount of time that it last. Walmart does carry this product for refills.</li>
    <li> Tap out head after each use.  Once a week, remove head and rinse it and top of shaver under hot water.  Shake out as much water as you can, then rinse head with alcohol from drug store.  Lightly shake excessive alcohol from head, reassemble and then clean.  The residual alcohol replenishes what is lost in the cartridge.  Flushing with water and alcohol is the recommended method for water resistant shavers that do not have cleaners and this leaves as little debris as possible in shaver before cleaning.  Removing, resealing, opening and reinserting cartridge is way too much hassle for me.</li>
    <li> This product met my expectations however I should have purchased a four or more pack. Next time. I recommend this solution for your electric razor.</li>
    <li> Did not come in a box also states that it&#x27;s Lemonfresh.It&#x27;s not.Will not be buying it again.You have a pictures of something you are selling then you send something different to the buyer in my book.You are not telling the truth.</li>
    <li> I bought this before reading the specifics and I was really disappointed. First, just after buying it for my son I realized that it was in fact NOT suitable for children under 3. I guess I should have read the fine print on the listing. That being said, I had a crate of these I had to get rid of, but apparently shipping to some locations was prohibited! It really begs the question of how people on Catalina Island keep their electric razors hygienic!? You might also notice that there is a picture of a lemon on the box but that it doesn&#x27;t taste like lemon at all? Really disappointing...</li>
    <li> The only reason it is not a 5 star is the price, It is too costly to use after every shave.  Maybe twice a week is all that I need to do.  I just clean out the foil after every shave .Helps makes for an absolutely clean shave.</li>
    <li> THE PHILADELPHIA EAGLES ARE ALL A DIS TASTE FULL ORGANIZATION OF STREET THUG MENTALITITY TO CONDONE THE SOCIAL BEHAVIOR OF WATCHING, PROMOTING, ENJOYING AND ENCOURAGING DOGS TO RIP OTHER DOG&#x27;S FACES OFF! SPORT? ROLE MODELS?</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I use my shaver every day and the cleaning solution works excellently</li>
    <li> As anticipated.  Good servie.</li>
    <li> These were a refill for my Braun razor.  The cartridges were received promptly, in good condition and work exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> Cost too much and is not good for very many cleanings. I think it is high due to the process and packaging.</li>
    <li> ordered 2 cartridges and was wondering why when I replaced one, the shaver smelled and shaver head was always wet. Then I realised it contained pure water and no cleaning fluid! (alcohol)</li>
    <li> Great! - need to buy more</li>
    <li> I chose this rating since I have to buy two to get one. They should be available this way for some persons. I use this over and over since I clean my shaver before I run it through the cleaner for the nice smell and oil they put in it to keep the razor head sharpened.That way the cleaner doesn&#x27;t get dirty until a couple of years.</li>
    <li> You know what these things are if you&#x27;re buying them. My advice to you is to refuse to buy them for over $5 per cartridge. Just wait, $5 per cartridge. No other price is fair.</li>
    <li> OEM, about the same price as local, easy to order.</li>
    <li> great buy thanks u guys r the best</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I order 4 or 6 packs at a time and give some to my sons who also have Braun series 7 shavers. I shave an average of every other day or so and find each cartridge last me around 2 months. Between my brush cleaning and use of the cleaning system after every use of the razor, my razor is always clean and ready. Replacing the razor head every 18 months also helps keep razor performance top notch.</li>
    <li> Work perfect at a nice price.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is they are the lemon scented version. They work fine of course, but your shaver will smell like you cleaned it with Pledge. No where on the product info does it say it is lemon scented.</li>
    <li> These are replacement cartridges for the newer Braun electric shavers.  Very simple to affix the replacement into the base of the cleaning unit and from there, it&#x27;s pretty straight forward.  This was the best price I found on the Internet, better than the website for Braun.</li>
    <li> They are not too expensive and I think they work very well. They keep my shaver clean and oiled. I always use them just as the instructions suggest. I spent a few hundred dollars on a shaver. It&#x27;s worth a few bucks a month to keep it in the best condition possible.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried to clean my Braun without using this system.  Nothing works as good as this system.  It cleans, lubricates and makes your shave experience much better.</li>
    <li> A great price and a must have for anyone who owns the Braun Shaving system.  I use it every day works great.</li>
    <li> This fluid sure works wonders with the clean n charge machine.  I am sure I am getting better shaves and longer life out the shaver because of it.  ...</li>
    <li> As some other reviewers have suggested, this is possibly the world&#x27;s greatest shaver system.  I get clean, close and comfortable shaves, even when I&#x27;m half asleep in the early morning.  I can&#x27;t tell you how much I love this shaver system, the best I&#x27;ve used in 30 years of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;But it seems like the prices on the refills are rapidly rising, and I&#x27;m not sure why.  I was paying $10.00 per two pack, including shipping, and I&#x27;ve watched them rise over the last six months to $16.00 per pair.  I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s whatever the market will bear, but I&#x27;ll keep looking for a $5.00 cartridge, since that&#x27;s about a dollar a week and it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Clean and charge refills are great.  They keep your razor extremly clean which keeps the cutting blades at their best.  I highly recommend this system.</li>
    <li> I have used a Braun razor for many years and sometimes cannot find the cleaner locally so have to order it.</li>
    <li> These are the standard refills for this rasor, no big surprise either way.&lt;br /&gt;Order fulfilled in reliable, fast manner. It works just fine.</li>
    <li> Product came jost as advertised and faster then anticipated.  Great doing business with you.[[ASIN:B000050FDX Braun 7000FC Syncro Replacement Combo, Black]]</li>
    <li> I would have given this product 5 stars but I have to admit they are quite expensive especially since I replace them every 1.5 months. That being said, the cleaner works seemlessly with my shaver. It provides a fresh and clean shave every morning.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful invention by Braun.  I love the blades, the shaver&#x27;s head, and most of all, I like the fresh new razor feel every time I need to shave.  I know lots love the conventional blade from Gillette or Schick, but electric razors are so convenient and easy and fast, I just save minutes using the electric shaver.  Braun&#x27;s clean and renew is awesome.  It&#x27;s easy to install and it&#x27;s easy to throw out.  The thing&#x27;s got alcohol to clean and disinfect (for the face that is important) and lubricant which makes the blades strong longer.  I know it&#x27;s about $10 per 2 to 2 and 1/2 months, but it is worth it.  As for the \\&quot;advice\\&quot; of do-it-yourself adding alcohol, if you&#x27;re gonna do that, why buy this \\&quot;system\\&quot; in the first place?  Anyhow, I&#x27;m all for saving money and finding a good substitute for trivial expenses such as this, but you&#x27;ll miss the \\&quot;lubricant\\&quot; ingredient and the other fine Braun contents.  Another poster mentioned that the \\&quot;lubricant\\&quot; remains and is always in the cartridge, but I guess it&#x27;s not necessary to clean out the residues and what&#x27;s inside the cartridge BEFORE filling with your homemade alcohol??  The Lubricant is just as important as the alcohol and without it, the blades will not be as sharp.  All in all, in you&#x27;re gonna use the homemade way, why not just buy any generic electric shaver and just throw the blade and netting into a cup with the alcohol to save more money??  I just think Braun did us all a great service in being innovative and constantly improving its products.  My life is so much better from using Braun shavers and this Braun cleaner.  It makes my shaving easy and I won&#x27;t buy another $200 shaving system for another 3 years.  Good stuff all around.</li>
    <li> great price and this stuff works great.  I take the cartridge out of the base and replace the cap to keep the fluid from evaporating - that way they last much longer.</li>
    <li> The product description and pictures shows two cartridges. I only recieved one in the package. I then emailed them and still no answer. Four days later I have been notified they are refunding the cost of 1 cartridge to me. I guess that was cheaper than than sending the second cartridge to me. Anyway they did resolve the issue. Thanks RX America</li>
    <li> keeps my razor like new</li>
    <li> It works well and cleans the shaver thoroughly. The packaging also was fine since the liquid should not be under pressure.&lt;br /&gt;The life time is reasonable considering the price</li>
    <li> These worked great for my 790cc shaver. I don&#x27;t use the alcohol cleaning function much. I wash thoroughly with water after every use, and do an economic clean once or maybe twice a week. One of these end up lasting me 3-4 months easy; I didn&#x27;t have any evaporation issues like other people have mentioned, not sure why that is. Amazon \\&quot;subscribe and save\\&quot; is a great way to save money on this product, since it does seem rather pricey for just some alcohol mixture. They&#x27;re probably refillable if you can figure out how not to make a mess out of it; although I&#x27;d sooner dish out the 10$ a year for these in convenience.</li>
    <li> I have to write some stuff in here, because this thing wouldn&#x27;t submit unless I write some text in here.</li>
    <li> t product &amp; fast shipping. A++</li>
    <li> I always fill it up with 70% ethanol and it works very well so I don&#x27;t have to buy it everytime</li>
    <li> Does an excellent job.</li>
    <li> Easiest way to buy this item. Same product as sold in stores I saved money and time and probably will buy this again!.</li>
    <li> It pays to purchase these refill cartridges for this great Electric Razor rather then the original and save a few dollars.They work perfectly and will purchase them again.</li>
    <li> Every other clean and renew cartridge i&#x27;ve purchsed has contained blue liquid with a strong alcohol smell to it.  This product contained a clear liquid with no smell, I hope this isn&#x27;t a refilled/repackaged product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Although the color is different, I cannot see or feel any difference after cleaning my shaver.  I&#x27;ll be buying this product again, I feel bad for being overly skeptical before. :/</li>
    <li> good for large cooler</li>
    <li> Have been a Braun shaver customer for over 10 years.  Have not even considered another brand of shaver.  The shaver head remains sharp for greater than the recommend replacement period of 18 months, undoubtedly facilitated by the clean and renew solution.</li>
    <li> As others have pointed out, you can definitely extend their life by cleaning every other day or every third day. I have not run into any problems doing this, and I&#x27;ve been using the same shaver and these refills for years. Glad I found the subscribe and save option; now new ones are always on the way just in time.</li>
    <li> These work fine, but after these ran out, I started making my own with straight rubbing alcohol.  My husband says they work fine and cost about $0.25 per refill.  There are lots of how-tos online.</li>
    <li> These cartridges are great for maintaining a healthy machine and they are sold by many vendors. I am very happy with my choice in supplier</li>
    <li> this was as good as expected.&lt;br /&gt;they did change the appearance without forewarning.&lt;br /&gt;same product</li>
    <li> Works well to clean and lubricate.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of the cartridges and they only sent me 1 and blotted out the number 2 on the receipt with marker total scam wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone I didn&#x27;t send it back because of the shipping charges and hassle just warning everyone</li>
    <li> it is cheaper than i bought in War-mark  and it can last about 60 days and replace once. good product</li>
    <li> I installed the first one of the two cartridges sent and it is working as it was expected by me</li>
    <li> They do what they say they will!!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, no problems, keeps the shaver clean and nicer to use. But, getting a little pricey.</li>
    <li> heres where the money leave you make you own . go online and read ..you can use many different things to make your own</li>
    <li> Great price and item as expected</li>
    <li> It was great being able to go to Amazon and find exactly what I needed and order it.  We weren&#x27;t able to find the refills in the store and this was so easy and fast.  We will definately order this again.</li>
    <li> You say this was shipped but I have never received this item. How can this be corrected?</li>
    <li> It will make you life a little easier using this auto-clean tool. The reason I rated it 4 instead of 5 is just because it&#x27;s not essential. You don&#x27;t have to use it if you prefer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To those who concern about the cost, my suggestions are &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1) Clean the shaver once a week. There is no noticeable difference if you clean the shaver more frequently.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2) After each use, pull the cartridge out and put the lid back on to prevent the fluid evaporation.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have used one for a full year already. Now it is just the time to buy the replacement. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This was the cheapest I found this product anywhere. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This system of keeping shaver clean &amp; lubricated is great. After using Norelco for 30+ years I switched to Braun mainly because of the cleaning system and am happy with the change.</li>
    <li> Braun Clean &amp; Renew Cartridges&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning fluid is dirty, leaving a brown stain on my shaver.  Cartridges are totally unsatisfactory.</li>
    <li> Great replacement for Braun shaver cleaning system. Definitely a great deal when you pair the shipping costs.</li>
    <li> I have a Braun Series 3 shaver with clean/recharge stand.  The Clean &amp; Renew cartridges help keep my shaver smooth running and lubricated.  They also help to reduce residue build up within the shaver cartridge.</li>
    <li> Does a great job but a little expensive-probably the container.</li>
    <li> Good price, good product</li>
    <li> They work as designed.  They are a better buy here than at wallmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need seven more stupid words to finish this.</li>
    <li> It is nice to have the shaver clean itself, unfortunately if you run out and neglect to manually clean your shaver it will get a really weird hair film all over the inside.  Also if you turn the cleaning solution/charging station on and the catridge is empty it seems to get even dirtier (its like it uses the already used solution).  The longevity of one of these cartridges is about one year.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to make it on your own but I would not recommend it. Alcohol, also evaporates over time when stagnant</li>
    <li> What can you say product works well and shuts off my dirty razor light. It&#x27;s all about price here</li>
    <li> Works very good wish it was less cheaper</li>
    <li> Cleans the razor great.</li>
    <li> Was just refills, but shipped fast and arrived perfect</li>
    <li> something produced by braun for their machines, should work, dont wash your razors with water, the washing stand takes more time to clean it</li>
    <li> Some people refill these, to me there is nothing like the fresh lemon scent these real braun cartridges.  They work just as you would expect, no issues and no problems.  I also wish they would last a little longer.</li>
    <li> Produce exactly as promoted. New origional Braun cleaning solution at a good price.  I will order from them again.</li>
    <li> Great price, works great in my Clean &amp; Renew Brown machine fro the shaver. amazing price and arrived quick.</li>
    <li> If you leave this under your braun shaver they will evaporate in a few weeks or less. I keep mine covered and in the drawer and only bring it out when I&#x27;m going to use it. I go through less than one a year!</li>
    <li> Several purchases ,the product has kept my Braun razor in tip top shape price &#x3D; value</li>
    <li> Much cheaper than buying at the store. Excellent value and it comes right to your door.&lt;br /&gt;Will for sure purchase again.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. As described.. Easy to deal with</li>
    <li> Excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lou Weintraub</li>
    <li> I have yet to use the spare cartridges I purchased as I still have the original cartridge that came with the Braun electric razor I purchased at Amazon a few months ago.  Sorry this is not a full review as you would expect.  The order was handled and shipped fine.</li>
    <li> I originally doubted that bathing my razor in a special fluid would help at all, but it really works! The razor shaves closer and smoother. I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
    <li> cleaning cartridges are difficult to find, so, to get them in a few days without having to go store to store is&lt;br /&gt;terrific</li>
    <li> Very happy with product</li>
    <li> This product works as well with my shaver system as did the original.  I received it in the time frame projected.</li>
    <li> This product goes with my Braun Series 7 and Wal-Mart No Longer provides this product.  So, I am forced to order online!</li>
    <li> too expensive and short lived ...</li>
    <li> Happy with replacement Clean and renew.  Received in timely manner.</li>
    <li> They worked just fine.</li>
    <li> So glad to have these available through Amazon.com.  They keep my shaver clean.</li>
    <li> I like the razor and you have to have these for it to work well - Braun&#x27;s system does work I have had it for 3 years and the clean and renew cartridges work well</li>
    <li> I really like my Braun shaver and these cleaning cartridges are easy to install and keep the shaver in good shape.</li>
    <li> Product seems to be an exact replacement for my shaver. Definitely improved performance as compared to what I had been using as it was quite dirty and need to be replaced.</li>
