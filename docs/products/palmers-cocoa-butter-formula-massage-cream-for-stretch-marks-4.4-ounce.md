      <li>I love this cream for my growing belly.</li>
      <li>Make sure to apply when your skin is already moist,  otherwise will have no effect.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>This is a fabulous cream!</li>
      <li>recommended many friends to buy</li>
      <li>I mostly focused on m belly area and sometimes my thighs.</li>
      <li>I love the consistency and it rubs in easily.  </li>
      <li>Cream smells very good and actually works!</li>
      <li>but right now i can not see if it is effective.</li>
      <li>good material as expected good</li>
      <li>it had a nice smell and was exactly what i was looking for.</li>
      <li>I give it to all my friends when I find out that they&#x27;re pregnant :))))</li>
      <li>My advice is to use this on every inch of your body while you&#x27;re pregnant since it seemed to work well on the areas it was applied!</li>
      <li>Make sure to do the research first!</li>
      <li>but I depend upon Palmer&#x27;s to deliver with helping diminish and smooth out my stretch mark imperfections.</li>
      <li>It goes on so smooth.</li>
      <li>Wish i could get a bottle free .</li>
      <li>so I thought the cream would be a better choice for a day moisturizer right out of the shower...</li>
      <li>I love the smell very much</li>
      <li>2x daily... smells nice though!</li>
      <li>It makes my skin soft with a nice touch like silk.</li>
      <li>Smells good and moisturizes all night until I shower next morning.</li>
      <li>Whereas before my skin was more rough and damaged it is now noticeably healing and has a nice cocoa butter scent.</li>
      <li>I started when I was about 4 months pregnant</li>
      <li>I hope it&#x27;s useful for my wife.</li>
      <li>love coconut water and young coconuts.</li>
      <li>I love the smell, it&#x27;s soft and fresh.</li>
      <li>Rubs in easily and is a nice way to relax and bond with you baby in utero while giving yourself a little R&amp;R time and a belly massage.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pregnant and after that I&#x27;ll let you know if it really helps to keep away the stretch marks.</li>
      <li>I have been slathering this cream on my belly, thighs, and breats since the first trimester.  </li>
      <li>and I started seeing the first signs of stretch marks at about 8 months.</li>
      <li>thick feel that worked great.</li>
      <li>I will most definitely be purchasing this formula of cocoa butter again.</li>
      <li>I used it during my first pregnancy</li>
      <li>I have used it on areas (hips) that I had stretch marks from puberty growth spurts, and they have faded and diminished so much!</li>
      <li>and continue to use it as it really helps my skin stay soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>And this cream is very hydrating.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t work really.</li>
      <li>Used it for about 2 weeks or so, didn&#x27;t really notice a difference...</li>
      <li>it was very good&lt;</li>
      <li>This product has made my stretch marks so much lighter and the linea nigra line that i had almost disappear.</li>
      <li>Also, it smell much better than some of the other creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>been using it for a couple weeks, nice lotion but not sure about the effeteness</li>
      <li>, I hope the next Amazon has more benefits to me, next time I will come!</li>
      <li>I am pregnant with my second child and I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Palmers.</li>
      <li>I used Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter, cream, and lotion 2x a day starting at 4 month pregnant.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend over any of the overpriced creams.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 58 years old and it works better than any other face lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
      <li>It has a nice, subtle smell and it is very creamy.</li>
      <li>The smell is &amp;#34;cocoa-y&amp;#34; and not my favorite, but it doesn&#x27;t last long, and isn&#x27;t bothersome.  </li>
      <li>I can certainly count on Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula Massage Cream for stretch marks to continue to help fade and dissipate my stretch marks while adding moisture and a smooth silky shine with every new little addition to my family.</li>
      <li>However, leaves you very soft.</li>
      <li>It makes them less visible, more like my skin tone, and it also made my old stretch marks smaller!</li>
      <li>I already have old stretch marks.</li>
      <li>Yes my stretch marks faded, but it could have been them naturally fading over time.</li>
      <li>still give it 4 stars because it&#x27;s inexpensive enough that if you want to try it, it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
      <li>and I find this product to be very beneficial and it is the only exclusive product that I use for stretch marks.</li>
      <li>Have gone through 4 tubes so far in my pregnancy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;ll probably take longer since I&#x27;m not using it was frequently.</li>
      <li>As far as stretch marks/</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s faded by 10% thus far).  </li>
      <li>So far I haven&#x27;t gotten any stretch marks</li>
      <li>It smells really bitter...must use different scent after using this...</li>
      <li>Used this almost everyday while I was pregnant.</li>
      <li>I like that this particular product has collagen and vitamin E which I can feel a deep penetrating moisture that is better than other products I have used in the past which were only oil based.</li>
      <li>I am 30 week pregnant and still no stretchmarks when I have gotten them in the past.</li>
      <li>Its now thin enough to absorb into my skin better.  </li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t really seen any progress yet, been using it for a little under a month</li>

<li> my opinion, unless I use this right after shower, it&#x27;s a bit hard to spread.  </li>
<li> However when you are pregnant and applying product (creams/oils) several times daily to combat dry skin and hopefully prevent some stretch marks by constantly moisturizing you can quickly become sick of the constant cocoa butter smell.</li>
<li> Not sure if I&#x27;m noticing much of a difference on my stretch marks or not,</li>
<li> haven&#x27;t been using long enough to see results, but we&#x27;ll see.</li>
<li> Used throughout my first pregnancy, gained 30 lbs, and I did not get any stretch marks... except for a small area that UNDER my belly, where I forgot to use it!  </li>
<li> It takes about 5-10 minutes to dry but it will definitely make your skin softer.</li>
<li> Buyers from China, although the long journey by surprise&lt;</li>
<li> I have been a Palmer&#x27;s fan for quite a long time</li>
<li> It takes way too long for me to massage into skin.  </li>
<li> I ended up squeezing the remaining cream into an old cocoa butter jar and adding a few drops of cocoa butter oil and primrose oil to it.  </li>
<li> but I&#x27;ve been looking into other alternatives with different smells.</li>
<li> We have had really dry weather</li>
<li> They&#x27;ve probably faded at least 30% so far.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days now and already see my stretch marks starting to fade away!</li>
<li> whats expected</li>
<li> I mean I have friends who just used plain old olive oil and coconut oil and didn&#x27;t get stretchmarks.</li>
<li> I did not notice a difference in the way it appeared or notice any less than I already have.</li>
<li> The creme has slight chocloate scent, but it is not overpowering.  </li>
<li> I have been using it since I had the baby 4 months ago to try to get rid of the few dark stretch marks that are there.  </li>
<li> My mother has TERRIBLE stretch marks, and I was so afraid I&#x27;d get the same when I was pregnant with my first!</li>
<li> According to my doctor I have very few strech mark compare to other mom she saw.  </li>
<li> Seen visible improvement in my stretch marks ( from losing a lot of weight) in just a few days.</li>
<li> She went through 25 tubes but was diligent on using it everyday.</li>
<li> I typically use cocoa butter as a night regiment because the consistency (thick and oily) would get on my clothes...</li>
<li> After asking my doctor and reading books and online articles, I&#x27;m not sure if stretchmarks is something you can avoid by rubbing in some cream.</li>
<li> We will See how well the stuff works when I&#x27;m further in my pregnancy, but its not real greasy and doesn&#x27;t smell bad so that&#x27;s a bonus</li>
<li> I know stretch marks have to do with genetics, but I was hoping this would at least minimize them.</li>
<li> it feels thick, and luxurious, and keeps me from getting itchy as my belly, thighs, and breats are growing during my pregnany.  </li>
<li> Thick and concentrated, but not greasy.</li>
<li> This cream is also too thick.</li>
<li> I used it everyday!!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s impossible not to get stretch marks during pregnancy, even if you apply something daily!</li>
<li> Not too thick, not too thin.</li>
<li> and I applied this lotion daily. :(</li>
<li> This is a very thick cream.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, I have awful stretch marks</li>
<li> wrong!!!!  </li>

<ol>
    <li> cream is working good reducing stretch marks</li>
    <li> Like this as a nice body moisterizer hope to see results soon but had for 4 days ain&#x27;t seen nothing yet</li>
    <li> The Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula was sent to me quickly in good condition. I have been using it and can feel an actual difference in the smoothness of my skin. Whereas before my skin was more rough and damaged it is now noticeably healing and has a nice cocoa butter scent. I like that this particular product has collagen and vitamin E which I can feel a deep penetrating moisture that is better than other products I have used in the past which were only oil based.</li>
    <li> Happy with the product</li>
    <li> Cream smells very good and actually works! Seen visible improvement in my stretch marks ( from losing a lot of weight) in just a few days. It doesn&#x27;t totally erase them but it helps reduce appearance and redness:D would reccomend</li>
    <li> Loved it! Made a huge difference in the appearance of my stretch marks and felt very good in my skin. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I use it on my belly,waist,hand,neck and face.I feel my skin become tender.I think I will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;  I hope I do not grow stretch marks:)</li>
    <li> This works pretty good! The stretch marks aren&#x27;t gone but they aren&#x27;t as red. It also smells awesome!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, I have awful stretch marks and I applied this lotion daily. :(</li>
    <li> I was recommended to use this as an excellent cream for prangnacy. I am still using and its great.no.strech marks</li>
    <li> The shopping experience makes me really happy, this thing is really great, just in time for the United States of promotional activities, the price is great, my family and I are very fond of it, I hope the next Amazon has more benefits to me, next time I will come!</li>
    <li> I use it every night and its come but no over all change.</li>
    <li> It moisturized. I already have old stretch marks. I did not notice a difference in the way it appeared or notice any less than I already have. Maybe, if t is purchased and used during the pregnancy it would make a difference.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if its the cream but I used it religiously every night and not stingy with the amount. Use for under arm and thigh, too.  According to my doctor I have very few strech mark compare to other mom she saw.  So I guess it works. The smell is nice, too.</li>
    <li> For my ,it is good for wife , I bought three one time .really cheap.suggest to buy this ,if you love your wife :)</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s working great! It&#x27;s impossible not to get stretch marks during pregnancy, even if you apply something daily! I&#x27;ve noticed that it works because it keeps the stretch marks from getting darker and a lot bigger. It makes them less visible, more like my skin tone, and it also made my old stretch marks smaller! I will keep using Palmer&#x27;s even after my daughter comes into this world! It&#x27;s also a great way to get my husband to join in, so we can enjoy spending some time together.</li>
    <li> Does not get rid of stretch marks our reduce appearance. Get something with retinol in out</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really seen any progress yet, been using it for a little under a month 2x daily... smells nice though!</li>
    <li> I have been slathering this cream on my belly, thighs, and breats since the first trimester.  The creme has slight chocloate scent, but it is not overpowering.  it feels thick, and luxurious, and keeps me from getting itchy as my belly, thighs, and breats are growing during my pregnany.  I am now in my 3rd trimester and reach for this cream dauly after my showers.</li>
    <li> I think that if you&#x27;re going to get stretch marks, it&#x27;s going to happen and there&#x27;s no miracle lotion to stop it. But this minimized a lot of the damage. Also, it smell much better than some of the other creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This cream worked wonders for my wife. She went through 25 tubes but was diligent on using it everyday. She got through her pregnancy and 4 weeks later she has her body back with no stretch marks. She&#x27;s happy</li>
    <li> This product includes ingredients that you are supposed to stay away from if you are pregnant!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use it!!! Make sure to do the research first!</li>
    <li> I used this during my pregnancy but I still got stretch marks towards the end of my pregnancy.  I started when I was about 4 months pregnant and I started seeing the first signs of stretch marks at about 8 months.</li>
    <li> I love this cream for my growing belly. We have had really dry weather and this has been a lifesaver. I highly recommend over any of the overpriced creams.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this post-pregnancy for a couple months now. Not sure if I&#x27;m noticing much of a difference on my stretch marks or not, but it smells good!</li>
    <li> Honestly, I couldn&#x27;t tell if this cream was working or not. Yes my stretch marks faded, but it could have been them naturally fading over time. Regardless, it didn&#x27;t hurt to go ahead and use the bottle up. After a while I didn&#x27;t see any difference so I just stopped using it. I&#x27;ve also heard rumors that cocoa/shea butter has no proven affect on stretch marks. Perhaps IF I ever get stretch marks again I would re-try this product. It has a nice, subtle smell and it is very creamy. Not too thick, not too thin. It takes about 5-10 minutes to dry but it will definitely make your skin softer.</li>
    <li> Buyers from China, although the long journey by surprise&lt;br /&gt;It is very comfortable to use&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance smell wonderful,packaging intact,&lt;br /&gt;forward to the next purchase</li>
    <li> I still got stretchmarks even with religious use of this product. After asking my doctor and reading books and online articles, I&#x27;m not sure if stretchmarks is something you can avoid by rubbing in some cream. I think genetics and your body shape plays a factor, too. I mean I have friends who just used plain old olive oil and coconut oil and didn&#x27;t get stretchmarks. I had friends who didn&#x27;t do anything and didn&#x27;t get stretchmarks. Then there are gals that tried everything and still got stretchmarks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still give it 4 stars because it&#x27;s inexpensive enough that if you want to try it, it&#x27;s very affordable. Plus it smells great and has a great texture. Rubs in easily and is a nice way to relax and bond with you baby in utero while giving yourself a little R&amp;R time and a belly massage. And this cream is very hydrating. I sometimes apply to hands and feet as well and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to try, go for it. Can&#x27;t hurt!</li>
    <li> I am pregnant with my second child and I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Palmers. However when you are pregnant and applying product (creams/oils) several times daily to combat dry skin and hopefully prevent some stretch marks by constantly moisturizing you can quickly become sick of the constant cocoa butter smell. So its a good product but I&#x27;ve been looking into other alternatives with different smells.</li>
    <li> I hope it&#x27;s useful for my wife. But it smell very strong. I have to open then window for a while after my wife use it.</li>
    <li> thick feel that worked great. No stretch marks after birth!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF! Not only did it smell amazong, but it works!! I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days now and already see my stretch marks starting to fade away! I will most definitely be purchasing this formula of cocoa butter again.</li>
    <li> Using Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula Massage Cream for stretch marks is just amazing! I have been a Palmer&#x27;s fan for quite a long time and I find this product to be very beneficial and it is the only exclusive product that I use for stretch marks. During my pregnancies and after having children my body suffered various stretch marks but I depend upon Palmer&#x27;s to deliver with helping diminish and smooth out my stretch mark imperfections. I can certainly count on Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula Massage Cream for stretch marks to continue to help fade and dissipate my stretch marks while adding moisture and a smooth silky shine with every new little addition to my family. FYI&#x3D; It also smells so yummy!</li>
    <li> I use the &amp;#34;Lotion&amp;#34; for stretch marks as a facial moisturizer.  It contains Collagen and Elastin, which is what the skin on our face needs.  I&#x27;m 58 years old and it works better than any other face lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin soft with a nice touch like silk. I&#x27;m pregnant and after that I&#x27;ll let you know if it really helps to keep away the stretch marks.</li>
    <li> This is a very thick cream.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, unless I use this right after shower, it&#x27;s a bit hard to spread.  In this case, I prefer the oil kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should I have known that cocoa butter smells like coconut?&lt;br /&gt;I love coconut water and young coconuts. but unfortunately I&#x27;m not a big coconut scented things.</li>
    <li> Superior product. Should never be more than $5, do not get overcharged! Thick and concentrated, but not greasy. I apply 2x a day to my thighs and stomach to help improve my skin&#x27;s stretching power. Also, I layer this over the Massage Lotion for Stretch Marks, as suggested. Smells good and moisturizes all night until I shower next morning. Make sure to apply when your skin is already moist,  otherwise will have no effect. Have gone through 4 tubes so far in my pregnancy. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love it. I use it every day after washing.I feel it is very good.When I use it over ,I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work really. I didn&#x27;t notice a difference. So I purchased the Strivectin instead! The strivectin is more expensive but I have already noticed a difference and I have only used it a week.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my friend. She says thhe massage cream is very good, and the price is also good too.</li>
    <li> used it diligently and still have stretch marks everywhere. I know stretch marks have to do with genetics, but I was hoping this would at least minimize them. didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Works well! I only use it about once a day (2-3 is recommended) and I can see it working. It&#x27;ll probably take longer since I&#x27;m not using it was frequently. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks. I use it on my stretch marks (not from pregnancy). They&#x27;ve probably faded at least 30% so far.</li>
    <li> I love this cream! I used it during my first pregnancy and I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks and I&#x27;m using it again.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous cream! I&#x27;ve used it during my pregnancies (whoohoo! no stretch marks!) and continue to use it as it really helps my skin stay soft and smooth. I put it on immediately after I shower, when my skin is still sort of damp. I love the smell, it&#x27;s soft and fresh. I have used it on areas (hips) that I had stretch marks from puberty growth spurts, and they have faded and diminished so much! It&#x27;s a great value and excellent product. I give it to all my friends when I find out that they&#x27;re pregnant :))))</li>
    <li> Used throughout my first pregnancy, gained 30 lbs, and I did not get any stretch marks... except for a small area that UNDER my belly, where I forgot to use it!  I love the consistency and it rubs in easily.  I used it after every shower.  The smell is &amp;#34;cocoa-y&amp;#34; and not my favorite, but it doesn&#x27;t last long, and isn&#x27;t bothersome.  I have been using it since I had the baby 4 months ago to try to get rid of the few dark stretch marks that are there.  It has already made them fainter.</li>
    <li> moisturing and smells great, i had to replenish my bottle i used so this was perfect. plus the price was great!</li>
    <li> Used it for about 2 weeks or so, didn&#x27;t really notice a difference...</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this cream! The thickness is perfect. It goes on so smooth. I recommend this lotion for daily use.</li>
    <li> Feels amazing on the skin, and smells good too! Love it!</li>
    <li> I like the smell, and the texture of this product. I just don&#x27;t understand how, and when it should start working. Will I NOTICE a change?? I have no idea..I haven&#x27;t seen anything different, as of yet. However, leaves you very soft.</li>
    <li> good material as expected good one&lt;br /&gt;good one&lt;br /&gt;good one&lt;br /&gt;good one&lt;br /&gt;good one&lt;br /&gt;do whats expected&lt;br /&gt;and it was very good&lt;br /&gt;i liked it</li>
    <li> It was recommended by a friend. I love the smell very much but right now i can not see if it is effective.</li>
    <li> Very good things.  recommended many friends to buy</li>
    <li> I typically use cocoa butter as a night regiment because the consistency (thick and oily) would get on my clothes...so I thought the cream would be a better choice for a day moisturizer right out of the shower...wrong!!!!  This cream is also too thick. (not greasy +++)  It takes way too long for me to massage into skin.  I ended up squeezing the remaining cream into an old cocoa butter jar and adding a few drops of cocoa butter oil and primrose oil to it.  Its now thin enough to absorb into my skin better.  As far as stretch marks/even skin tone I do notice a difference in my skin.  It&#x27;s a gradual difference (I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s faded by 10% thus far).  I didn&#x27;t like the fact I needed to doctor up the cream. (which is why I gave it 3 stars)  I think I&#x27;ll just stick to palmer cocoa butter for a night time fix.</li>
    <li> I thought this was cocoa butter, but it&#x27;s actually a lotion with cocoa butter in it.  I do like that it&#x27;s not too greasy.  Smells nice.  So far I haven&#x27;t gotten any stretch marks but I&#x27;m only 30 weeks into this pregnancy, we&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> been using it for a couple weeks, nice lotion but not sure about the effeteness</li>
    <li> It smells really bitter...must use different scent after using this...haven&#x27;t been using long enough to see results, but we&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> I am 30 week pregnant and still no stretchmarks when I have gotten them in the past. I use bio-oil first and then layer it with this and so far-so good!  Only thing is I end up applying often.  If I can go 10 more weeks without a mark it will be 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I loved this product..it had a nice smell and was exactly what i was looking for. I used it everyday!!</li>
    <li> This is the best stretch mark cream at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> We will See how well the stuff works when I&#x27;m further in my pregnancy, but its not real greasy and doesn&#x27;t smell bad so that&#x27;s a bonus</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good as a hand cream as well, love it</li>
    <li> If you are looking for something that will get rid of your stretch marks that have already surfaced, I do not recommend this product. I used this product continuously on my stretch marks and it did not help them at all, and my stretch marks weren&#x27;t even too severe. If you are trying to prevent stretch marks, then this will work or you. Otherwise, this product will not work on stretch marks that you already have.</li>
    <li> Used this almost everyday while I was pregnant. I mostly focused on m belly area and sometimes my thighs. I didn&#x27;t get stretch arms in those two areas but I did get some on my chest and my hips. My advice is to use this on every inch of your body while you&#x27;re pregnant since it seemed to work well on the areas it was applied!</li>
    <li> This product has made my stretch marks so much lighter and the linea nigra line that i had almost disappear. The streatch marks are lighter and smaller</li>
    <li> The way to go!! My mother has TERRIBLE stretch marks, and I was so afraid I&#x27;d get the same when I was pregnant with my first! I used Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter, cream, and lotion 2x a day starting at 4 month pregnant. I went to 41 weeks, and----guess what?? Not ONE stretch mark! SO happy!!!!</li>
    <li> Its a good product . Wish i could get a bottle free .</li>
</ol>
