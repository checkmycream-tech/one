      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>It works beautifully as a combination moisturizer and foundation with the light tint.</li>
      <li>Very fair blonde/blue, lots of freckles, 40, rarely wear makeup.  </li>
      <li>It does not seem to be as effective in blocking the sun as I would expect for an SPF 30.    </li>

      <li>I really liked the product.</li>
      <li>Buy at your own risk</li>
      <li>It was nice to find a moisturizer with 30 SPF.  </li>
      <li>Throw this on to protect against sun damage and when I don&#x27;t have time for make up (it gives the skin a nice glow.).</li>

      <li>Best moisturizer for my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Very light and doesn&#x27;t build up.  </li>
      <li>Very lightly tinted moisturizer to the SPF 30 sunscreen...</li>
      <li>good product quick delivery</li>
      <li>Wonder how many I would have to order for the rest of my life????????</li>
      <li>I decided to try the Healthy Defense product instead.    </li>
      <li>although I like this product I do prefer the Ageless Intensives because I feel like it hydrates my skin better than the Healthy Defense.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I use this every day and love it.</li>
      <li>I truly love this product, which is why I have it on auto delivery</li>
      <li>Wish this item was not discontinued glad I could still get it 😊</li>
      <li>I love this moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I love the color of this cream, it complements my skin well.</li>
      <li>This is the best facial moisturizer I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>I bought the light tint when the non-tinted was out of stock and now I don&#x27;t even need to wear foundation!  </li>
      <li>I love it; moisturizer with tint and sunscreen --- PERFECT.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the reason why I ordered this from Amazon is that Neutrogena has discontinued it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>have been mixing this tinted moisturizer with my sunscreen for many years.</li>
      <li>I wish I had paid more attention to the reviews that warned of this.  </li>
      <li>or you would be able to take it off with your finger.</li>
      <li>It takes the place of my makeup on most days.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad that this product is available with Amazon!</li>
      <li>I love this</li>
      <li>I use this product a lot and love that I can get it from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>but it adds more color than I anticipated.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I get more compliments about my skin whenever I use this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and I love it.  </li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my 30s with very fair skin and Neutrogena Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer,</li>
      <li>Love the tint and works great on sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I also have used Neutrogena Healthy Defense spf 30 Light Tint for just as many years.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>I apply a light, even coating of moisturizer to my face and neck--right out of the shower--and it gives me a healthy glow without having to wear foundation.</li>
      <li>Blends easily and doesn&#x27;t feel like I put anything on my face.</li>
      <li>Not greasy or oily at all and was easy to blend in and spread on.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and easy.</li>
      <li>The moisturizer went on fine</li>
      <li>I do not wear foundation and this is perfect for giving a little color to my face without feeling like my skin can&#x27;t breath.  </li>
      <li>The moisture is perfect, little or no shine.</li>
      <li>All in all, this is an acceptable sub until the Ageless product becomes available.  </li>
      <li>Wanted the medium tint but wasn&#x27;t available.  </li>
      <li>I mix it 1:1 with my foundation and it gives my skin a fantastic glow.</li>
      <li>And Amazon is doubling the price of the few remaining tubes of this excellent product!  </li>
      <li>a moisturizer and a light tint for my face</li>
      <li>Use it every day for sun screen AND a light make-up/moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>it is light and not oily.  </li>
      <li>, it is light and not greasy.</li>
      <li>This was way too light for me, so I gave it away.</li>
      <li>I have light freckles.</li>
      <li>I hope Neutrogena always has this available.</li>
      <li>I think it provides good sun protection, but I feel like I need to put more moisturizer under it as my skin still feels dry if I just use it.</li>
      <li>have always been impressed with Amazon  Customer Service, but certainly, no more...</li>
      <li>This product is described as a light tint, but it really seems more medium tint.  </li>
      <li>If you have younger skin or do not spend hours outside this may be the perfect product for you.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery.</li>
      <li>I have been a steady customer of Amazon for many years.  </li>
      <li>This light tint is still too dark for my fair skin.  </li>
      <li>Great moisturizer without being too greasy or heavy</li>
      <li>This is a great everyday moisturizer with a a bit of tint....sunscreen also.  </li>
      <li>My advice: I mix the tinted product with a really creamy, fairly cheap moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I do use it on top of a facial moisturizer, it is non greasy and applies smoothly.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product for several years &amp; love the light tint -</li>
      <li>It gives your skin a healthy glow, looks naturally tan, not made-up.  </li>
      <li>The SPF definitely works and it leaves a really nice hint of color.</li>
      <li>i rarely wear makeup.  </li>
      <li>I love the light tint - it&#x27;s enough that I can go without any makeup.</li>
      <li>I keep reordering it because it&#x27;s noncomedigenic and just plain great.</li>
      <li>it gives just the right amount of coverage without looking like I am wearing make-up.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light &amp; non-greasy with a high SPF.</li>
      <li>This may be fine for some, or fine for mid-summer, but it will look out of place in the middle of winter.  </li>
      <li>So I couldn&#x27;t use it as much as I wanted to, I had to dispose of it with almost its full content.</li>
      <li>Provides nice even tone and just enough tint without being too much.</li>
      <li>You can buy Olay or even the generic brand moisturizers with SPF and they have the same ingredients and work great.</li>
      <li>Gives a very gentle tint and does not irritate my skin or make me break out.  </li>
      <li>I like this sunscreen very much.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much.</li>
      <li>Good product, but would prefer it be a little creamer  </li>
      <li>was better at blocking UV, because of the physical make-up component.  </li>
      <li>;)  </li>
      <li>The ONLY thing I would change, is a tad more tint in the product.  </li>
      <li>Bottom line, it does exactly what I need.....</li>
      <li>Its located next to Healthy Defense on the shelf and says on the box &amp;#34;Compare to Neutrogena Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>And it also clumped up around my eyebrows and the sides of my face, even though I didn&#x27;t use that much!</li>
      <li>I loved it at first, but noticed that after wearing it for a few hours my forehead would be very oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>to the great disappointment of many, it is being taken off the market.  </li>
      <li>I would never buy an expensive high end foundation when this does the trick perfectly, plus is has the SPF 30 for protection.</li>
      <li>I realize that with the constant use it has minimize fine lines &amp; skin is supple.</li>
      <li>I cannot find any reasonable substitute for this... moisturizer, sunscreen, face tint, all in one application.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>It needs to be rubbed in and blended really well to avoid leaving the dreaded \\&quot;foundation line.\\</li>
      <li>It is light, and with the tint, I can wear it only, without the need for liquid foundation.  </li>
      <li>Also, I can no longer wear blush because it because really splotchy.</li>
      <li>But really, by using this, don&#x27;t need blush.</li>
      <li>Purchase Rite Aid Renewal daily moisturizer Light Tint instead.  </li>
      <li>well as it you not rub it very well into your face</li>
      <li>which is why i dont really wear makeup.  </li>
      <li>That way it spreads really well, covers and protects my skin.</li>
      <li>It really hidrates your skin.</li>
      <li>I highly recomend this moisturizer!</li>
      <li>The color of this \\&quot;light tint\\&quot; is quite dark, way too dark for fair skin.</li>
      <li>I used it on top of my normal regimen of face serum, etc., and it would peel and leave \\&quot;pills\\&quot; of gummed up brown goo [because its tinted], so I tried it on my bare face, because I need a moisturizer and SPF protection, and the same thing happened.</li>
      <li>now make the same product with &amp;#34;heliopex&amp;#34; which I am most definitely allergic to (and so are many other people).</li>
      <li>I have never in my life actually thrown away a full product, until this one.</li>
      <li>(kleenex stays clean, no marks on clothes, no bare spots on face.  </li>
      <li>works great love it, hard to find in stores, expensive but worth it, thanks.</li>
      <li>The Neutrogena brand has always rocked in my opinion; no matter what it was that I bought, it always delivered exceedingly, until I tried this particular item.</li>
      <li>It has the same ingredients as Healthy Defense and looks the same when applied to the face.  </li>
      <li>If I were going to be in/out of the water, or somewhere where it is very hot, I&#x27;d probably take it with me and re-apply as necessary.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Needed a little more coverage.  </li>
      <li>Even with blotting off the excess oil, I started to break out on my forehead, which isn&#x27;t normal for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have pale skin and was hoping to be able to use this moisturizer instead of foundation.  </li>
      <li>Light Tint, SPF 30 is the only facial moisturizer I use.</li>
      <li>I liked the previous product and had to do some detective work to find this currently named product, which I believe is the same as the discontinued one.  </li>
      <li>This product goes on a little thicker and doesn&#x27;t feel as light on my skin.     </li>
      <li>It provides moisture AND tint, which is honestly something I haven&#x27;t found in other tinted moisturizers; I feel like you either get one or the other!</li>
      <li>I have used this product for some time &amp; really liked this item in the past, however the tube I received is NOT broad spectrum like it is shown in the picture.</li>
      <li>I am 57 years old and</li>
      <li>I followed the directions, saying to apply directly after cleansing.  </li>
      <li>Thus far RiteAid is not discontinuing their product...</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t sting my sensitive skin or eyes.  </li>
      <li>when i squeezed this out of the tube i thought wow</li>
      <li>The sunscreen also makes the moisturizer too heavy and greasy; it caused a significant break-out of my sensitive skin, even though I used it sparingly.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff, it is hard to find locally.  </li>
      <li>Instead, it was so dark on my skin that I had to apply powder over top to tone down the brown of the tint.  </li>
      <li>I was surprised to find that I only received 1 tube for the price of $41.97!  </li>
      <li>I paid $18--including shipping--for this tiny, tiny, little bottle of moisturizer in a box way too big for it (and it didn&#x27;t arrive quickly, either).</li>
      <li>It goes on easily, and although it is a little dark for my extremely pale skin,it made a good base for light coverage of mineral makeup.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work any better than other moisturizers, in fact I prefer the texture of other moisturizers and this one also has an odd smell.</li>
      <li>(like if you smile too hard, your skin might crack)</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any smell, good or bad.</li>

<li> It is light, and with the tint, I can wear it only, without the need for liquid foundation.  </li>
<li> Also, I can no longer wear blush because it because really splotchy.</li>
<li> But really, by using this, don&#x27;t need blush.</li>
<li> Purchase Rite Aid Renewal daily moisturizer Light Tint instead.  </li>
<li> well as it you not rub it very well into your face</li>
<li> which is why i dont really wear makeup.  </li>
<li> That way it spreads really well, covers and protects my skin.</li>
<li> It really hidrates your skin.</li>
<li> I highly recomend this moisturizer!</li>
<li> The color of this \\&quot;light tint\\&quot; is quite dark, way too dark for fair skin.</li>
<li> I used it on top of my normal regimen of face serum, etc., and it would peel and leave \\&quot;pills\\&quot; of gummed up brown goo [because its tinted], so I tried it on my bare face, because I need a moisturizer and SPF protection, and the same thing happened.</li>
<li> now make the same product with &amp;#34;heliopex&amp;#34; which I am most definitely allergic to (and so are many other people).</li>
<li> I have never in my life actually thrown away a full product, until this one.</li>
<li> (kleenex stays clean, no marks on clothes, no bare spots on face.  </li>
<li> works great love it, hard to find in stores, expensive but worth it, thanks.</li>
<li> The Neutrogena brand has always rocked in my opinion; no matter what it was that I bought, it always delivered exceedingly, until I tried this particular item.</li>
<li> It has the same ingredients as Healthy Defense and looks the same when applied to the face.  </li>
<li> If I were going to be in/out of the water, or somewhere where it is very hot, I&#x27;d probably take it with me and re-apply as necessary.</li>
<li> Highly recommend.</li>
<li> Highly recommend it.</li>
<li> Needed a little more coverage.  </li>
<li> Even with blotting off the excess oil, I started to break out on my forehead, which isn&#x27;t normal for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I have pale skin and was hoping to be able to use this moisturizer instead of foundation.  </li>
<li> Light Tint, SPF 30 is the only facial moisturizer I use.</li>
<li> I liked the previous product and had to do some detective work to find this currently named product, which I believe is the same as the discontinued one.  </li>
<li> This product goes on a little thicker and doesn&#x27;t feel as light on my skin.     </li>
<li> It provides moisture AND tint, which is honestly something I haven&#x27;t found in other tinted moisturizers; I feel like you either get one or the other!</li>
<li> I have used this product for some time &amp; really liked this item in the past, however the tube I received is NOT broad spectrum like it is shown in the picture.</li>
<li> I am 57 years old and</li>
<li> I followed the directions, saying to apply directly after cleansing.  </li>
<li> Thus far RiteAid is not discontinuing their product...</li>
<li> and it doesn&#x27;t sting my sensitive skin or eyes.  </li>
<li> when i squeezed this out of the tube i thought wow</li>
<li> The sunscreen also makes the moisturizer too heavy and greasy; it caused a significant break-out of my sensitive skin, even though I used it sparingly.</li>
<li> Love this stuff, it is hard to find locally.  </li>
<li> Instead, it was so dark on my skin that I had to apply powder over top to tone down the brown of the tint.  </li>
<li> I was surprised to find that I only received 1 tube for the price of $41.97!  </li>
<li> I paid $18--including shipping--for this tiny, tiny, little bottle of moisturizer in a box way too big for it (and it didn&#x27;t arrive quickly, either).</li>
<li> It goes on easily, and although it is a little dark for my extremely pale skin,it made a good base for light coverage of mineral makeup.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t work any better than other moisturizers, in fact I prefer the texture of other moisturizers and this one also has an odd smell.</li>
<li> (like if you smile too hard, your skin might crack)</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t notice any smell, good or bad.</li>
<li> I particularly appreciate the SPF 30 because I burn with very little exposure.</li>
<li> This product is similar to a previous product which Neutrogena marketed under a different name and subsequently discontinued.  </li>
<li> It is darker than I expected, but the coverage is so sheer it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter.  </li>
<li> Have been using this moisturizer as long as I can remember.</li>
<li> It made my face look muddy, not natural at all.</li>
<li> Need to wait 10 minutes for it to dry</li>
<li> single star is for Amazon, not Neutrogena.</li>
<li> I used it as a moisturized every single day.</li>
<li> I have tried using less lotion, with the same effect.  </li>
<li> It was a total waste of my money and time.</li>
<li> The moisturizer does last all day without being heavy.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know whether I am paler than I thought or this is darker than I expected</li>
<li> I tried other products, including other Neutrogena moisturizers, but they do not compare to this one.  </li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t had this problem with other Neutrogena products.</li>
<li> I will use my other moisturizer made by Neutrogena from now on and through this one out.</li>
<li> I am a fan of Neurtogena products, but this one is not up to their usual standard.</li>
<li> I read some of the other reviews.</li>
<li> As soon as my face began to sweat at all, it became slippery and very wet.  </li>
<li> and I ended up with dark, orange-y brown streaks at the edges if I wasn&#x27;t very careful with my application.  </li>
<li> It does look dark coming out of the tube, but it lightens as you spread it over your skin, and I also appreciate that it is unscented.</li>
<li> Not worth the cost.</li>
<li> Now they are not nice enough in appearance to use as gifts.</li>
<li> But I not only got very little protection for the sun but also had every spot show darker!</li>
<li> I am upset because the packaging was a dented mess.</li>
<li> When I use this product it evens out my skin tone, gives me a little bit of color, and has sunscreen.</li>
<li> after i let it soak in for awhile i still had to touch it up with some powder because it looked oily and it also felt a little heavy</li>
<li> Have been using this product for a few years now.  </li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> The tint in this moisturizer is NOT a light color.  </li>
<li> but after a few hours my eyes started to burn and itch.</li>
<li> I was not satisfied with this product because when I got it I was about to expired.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for the past 10 years</li>
<li> Different texture, wrong color and had a film</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t found this in the stores lately, not sure why.  </li>
<li> Impossible to find at local CVS or other &amp;#34;pharmacies&amp;#34;.  </li>
<li> My understanding is that it has been discontinued but available here on Amazon at outrageous prices.  </li>
<li> No good.</li>
<li> Unfortunately it has been discontinued.</li>
<li> , I didn&#x27;t feel guilty about throwing it in the garbage at all.</li>
<li> i think ill stick with oil of olay</li>
<li> Sorry.</li>
<li> It just looked so bad</li>
<li> Too bad it will no longer be produced.</li>
<li> I was disappointed.  </li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>
<li> Terrible packaging!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like this product. Unfortunately it has been discontinued. Wonder how many I would have to order for the rest of my life????????</li>
    <li> Provides nice even tone and just enough tint without being too much. Blends easily and doesn&#x27;t feel like I put anything on my face.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Neutrogena Ageless Intensives Tone Correcting Tinted Moisture, Sheer Tint, SPF 30, which is currently out of stock on AMAZON.  I decided to try the Healthy Defense product instead.    I am 57 years old and although I like this product I do prefer the Ageless Intensives because I feel like it hydrates my skin better than the Healthy Defense.  This product goes on a little thicker and doesn&#x27;t feel as light on my skin.     I have found that if I am working outside for several hours, I still need a sunscreen product under this one.  It does not seem to be as effective in blocking the sun as I would expect for an SPF 30.    All in all, this is an acceptable sub until the Ageless product becomes available.  If you have younger skin or do not spend hours outside this may be the perfect product for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 30s with very fair skin and Neutrogena Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer, Light Tint, SPF 30 is the only facial moisturizer I use. I apply a light, even coating of moisturizer to my face and neck--right out of the shower--and it gives me a healthy glow without having to wear foundation. It does look dark coming out of the tube, but it lightens as you spread it over your skin, and I also appreciate that it is unscented. My daily makeup routine consists of this moisturizer, eye makeup, blush, and lipstick. Even on my wedding day I wore only this moisturizer as my foundation, with a dusting of Mineral Veil to reduce shine. I particularly appreciate the SPF 30 because I burn with very little exposure. I do add sunscreen if I&#x27;m going to be outside for a while (mountain biking, water park, picnic, etc.) but this is all I need for daily protection.</li>
    <li> I bought the untinted moisturizer, because I was looking for just a lightweight product that I could use on my face as sunscreen.  I was disappointed.  As soon as my face began to sweat at all, it became slippery and very wet.  I have tried using less lotion, with the same effect.  I followed the directions, saying to apply directly after cleansing.  I&#x27;ll try something else now.</li>
    <li> I was not satisfied with this product because when I got it I was about to expired. So I couldn&#x27;t use it as much as I wanted to, I had to dispose of it with almost its full content. It was a total waste of my money and time.</li>
    <li> I cannot find any reasonable substitute for this... moisturizer, sunscreen, face tint, all in one application.  I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for a few years now.  Gives a very gentle tint and does not irritate my skin or make me break out.  I do use it on top of a facial moisturizer, it is non greasy and applies smoothly.  I use it every day, in the summer I have not ever needed extra sunblock and have never had a sunburn while wearing it.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Wanted the medium tint but wasn&#x27;t available.  Been using this daily for years.</li>
    <li> Who am I?  Very fair blonde/blue, lots of freckles, 40, rarely wear makeup.  I bought this after reading tinted spf was better at blocking UV, because of the physical make-up component.  Plus, I figured hey, I&#x27;m 40.  Put some makeup on!  Anyhow, this worked great.  Evens out my skin tone without being obvious.  I also noticed it doesn&#x27;t rub off on things either (kleenex stays clean, no marks on clothes, no bare spots on face.  It is darker than I expected, but the coverage is so sheer it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter.  So why can&#x27;t I use it?  For reasons I don&#x27;t understand, my eyes burn when I&#x27;m wearing it.  I&#x27;ve tried reapplying it different ways, and it is not actually getting into my eyes, but I notice the irritated itchy eyes within 20 min or so of applying this product.  Otherwise I would be very happy with it.  I&#x27;ll use this tube on my arms and chest, but not on my face.</li>
    <li> Love how I can used this as sun protection, moisturizer and foundation all in one!</li>
    <li> I bought three different products to try, and rotate between.  Of the three, this is the only one that is too deep in color. This product is described as a light tint, but it really seems more medium tint.  I look like a have a tan, instead of just blending my skin color. This may be fine for some, or fine for mid-summer, but it will look out of place in the middle of winter.  Otherwise seems like a good product.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Good price</li>
    <li> The Neutrogena brand has always rocked in my opinion; no matter what it was that I bought, it always delivered exceedingly, until I tried this particular item. It \\&quot;clumped\\&quot; and \\&quot;gummed\\&quot; on my face after my shower. I used it on top of my normal regimen of face serum, etc., and it would peel and leave \\&quot;pills\\&quot; of gummed up brown goo [because its tinted], so I tried it on my bare face, because I need a moisturizer and SPF protection, and the same thing happened. I could not believe it! I have never, ever, had to return a product through Amazon, but for this one.</li>
    <li> I use this every day and love it. Just a touch of color with all that sun protection.</li>
    <li> I truly love this product, which is why I have it on auto delivery ;)  I do not wear foundation and this is perfect for giving a little color to my face without feeling like my skin can&#x27;t breath.  The ONLY thing I would change, is a tad more tint in the product.  If you are like me and do not like to wear foundation because of the way it makes your skin feel (like if you smile too hard, your skin might crack) this is perfect for you!</li>
    <li> Wish this item was not discontinued glad I could still get it 😊</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for the past 10 years and I love it!  I mix it 1:1 with my foundation and it gives my skin a fantastic glow. It&#x27;s also great on its own. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This bottle is not even 2 ounces and it costs more than $11! What a rip off. It doesn&#x27;t work any better than other moisturizers, in fact I prefer the texture of other moisturizers and this one also has an odd smell. You can buy Olay or even the generic brand moisturizers with SPF and they have the same ingredients and work great. I will not be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Best protective moisturizer that I have used.</li>
    <li> Good product, but would prefer it be a little creamer  Needed a little more coverage.  Product had good color and no fragrance.</li>
    <li> I paid $18--including shipping--for this tiny, tiny, little bottle of moisturizer in a box way too big for it (and it didn&#x27;t arrive quickly, either). It needs to be rubbed in and blended really well to avoid leaving the dreaded \\&quot;foundation line.\\&quot; I ended up liking it after a lot of trial and error, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying it again. Not worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Impossible to find at local CVS or other &amp;#34;pharmacies&amp;#34;.  I have used this product for several years &amp; love the light tint - it gives just the right amount of coverage without looking like I am wearing make-up.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t like what I had bought from the store.  Different texture, wrong color and had a film</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer.  It is light, and with the tint, I can wear it only, without the need for liquid foundation.  I just use this after cleansing, and then touch up with some powder.  It is great!!!!</li>
    <li> I love the color of this cream, it complements my skin well. Goes on smooth and easy. I didn&#x27;t notice any smell, good or bad. Not greasy or oily at all and was easy to blend in and spread on.</li>
    <li> This is the best facial moisturizer I have ever used.  I bought the light tint when the non-tinted was out of stock and now I don&#x27;t even need to wear foundation!  It gives your skin a healthy glow, looks naturally tan, not made-up.  The moisturizer does last all day without being heavy.  This has SPF30 in it as well as the tint and moisturization, what else could any girl need??</li>
    <li> Do the folks at Neutrogena know what \\&quot;light\\&quot; means? The color of this \\&quot;light tint\\&quot; is quite dark, way too dark for fair skin.</li>
    <li> I have been a steady customer of Amazon for many years.  I also have used Neutrogena Healthy Defense spf 30 Light Tint for just as many years.&lt;br /&gt;Now to the great disappointment of many, it is being taken off the market.  And Amazon is doubling the price of the few remaining tubes of this excellent product!  Shame on you, Amazon, for taking advantage of the situation and doubling the price for your faithful customers.&lt;br /&gt;I have always been impressed with Amazon  Customer Service, but certainly, no more...&lt;br /&gt;The single star is for Amazon, not Neutrogena.</li>
    <li> They should bring it back</li>
    <li> I was surprised to find that I only received 1 tube for the price of $41.97!  I assumed I would receive 2-3 tubes in the packet for this price!  will not make this mistake again!</li>
    <li> This product is similar to a previous product which Neutrogena marketed under a different name and subsequently discontinued.  I liked the previous product and had to do some detective work to find this currently named product, which I believe is the same as the discontinued one.  Bottom line, it does exactly what I need.....a moisturizer and a light tint for my face (so I don&#x27;t look like a ghost).  My daughter-in-law also uses it. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used this this product for years!!!!  I love it; moisturizer with tint and sunscreen --- PERFECT.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the reason why I ordered this from Amazon is that Neutrogena has discontinued it.&lt;br /&gt;They now make the same product with &amp;#34;heliopex&amp;#34; which I am most definitely allergic to (and so are many other people).</li>
    <li> This light tint is still too dark for my fair skin.  I use it on my face (not neck) and I look like wearing a mask because of 2 colors.  It is also greasy/oily.</li>
    <li> Have been using this moisturizer as long as I can remember. It&#x27;s light &amp; non-greasy with a high SPF. I use it even under my makeup. I realize that with the constant use it has minimize fine lines &amp; skin is supple. Works well for me.</li>
    <li> have been mixing this tinted moisturizer with my sunscreen for many years. can&#x27;t understand why neutrogena discontinued it. found it here and stocked up.LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> Neutrogena, but it breaks my face out under the skin.</li>
    <li> This product accentuated the different pigmentation on my skin. I like to use SPF (protection) with tint (sun spots) on my face. But I not only got very little protection for the sun but also had every spot show darker! Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product but now is unavailable in stores.  My understanding is that it has been discontinued but available here on Amazon at outrageous prices.  I work in an industry where make up is not allowed and this product provided moisturizer and coverage for my skin type.  I tried other products, including other Neutrogena moisturizers, but they do not compare to this one.  Hopefully, Neutrogena will listen to their consumers and bring this product back.</li>
    <li> I was going to buy and try this product because of these great reviews, but changed my mind after reading the reviews on ewg website - http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/product/566797/Neutrogena_Healthy_Defense_Daily_Moisturizer%2C_SPF_30/</li>
    <li> The tint in this moisturizer is NOT a light color.  I wish I had paid more attention to the reviews that warned of this.  I have pale skin and was hoping to be able to use this moisturizer instead of foundation.  Instead, it was so dark on my skin that I had to apply powder over top to tone down the brown of the tint.  It doesn&#x27;t blend well at the edges and I ended up with dark, orange-y brown streaks at the edges if I wasn&#x27;t very careful with my application.  The sunscreen also makes the moisturizer too heavy and greasy; it caused a significant break-out of my sensitive skin, even though I used it sparingly.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. The SPF definitely works and it leaves a really nice hint of color. The only reason for a 4 star is that it can be greasy. Need to wait 10 minutes for it to dry or you would be able to take it off with your finger. Also, I can no longer wear blush because it because really splotchy. Need to figure soemthing out about that. But really, by using this, don&#x27;t need blush.</li>
    <li> I need a good sunscreen as I am outdoors a lot.  the tinted one is nice sometimes but I also use the regular one.  They both do the job of protecting my skin.</li>
    <li> Purchase Rite Aid Renewal daily moisturizer Light Tint instead.  Its located next to Healthy Defense on the shelf and says on the box &amp;#34;Compare to Neutrogena Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer&amp;#34;.  It has the same ingredients as Healthy Defense and looks the same when applied to the face.  I bought it for $11.  Thus far RiteAid is not discontinuing their product... they keep restocking it.</li>
    <li> Love the tint and works great on sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I like this sunscreen very much. It takes the place of my makeup on most days.  I think it lasts about 3 months for me and I wear it&lt;br /&gt;everyday. I am upset because the packaging was a dented mess. They put two of these moisturizers in with some candied fruit that I ordered. It appears that the fruit shifted and smashed the two boxes. Now they are not nice enough in appearance to use as gifts.That is the only reason I gave the product 4 stars instead of 5. Terrible packaging!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer without being too greasy or heavy and it doesn&#x27;t sting my sensitive skin or eyes.  I like the sheer tint and SPF 30.</li>
    <li> The moisturizer went on fine but after a few hours my eyes started to burn and itch. There&#x27;s something in this product that causes allergic reactions. I haven&#x27;t had this problem with other Neutrogena products. I will use my other moisturizer made by Neutrogena from now on and through this one out.</li>
    <li> Overpriced compared to armed forces commissary prices.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, it is hard to find locally.  Use it every day for sun screen AND a light make-up/moisturizer.  Feels so good!</li>
    <li> Very light and doesn&#x27;t build up.  No skin sensitivity which is a big thing for me.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years, my only foundation.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  Not only does it protect your face from the sun.....it is light and not oily.  I would definitely recommend this for everyone to use.</li>
    <li> I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great summer (as well as year-round!) skin protector. Very lightly tinted moisturizer to the SPF 30 sunscreen...I really liked the product. Applied once in the morning, it&#x27;s my daily makeup. If I were going to be in/out of the water, or somewhere where it is very hot, I&#x27;d probably take it with me and re-apply as necessary.</li>
    <li> lightweight, has sunscreen and is very easy to apply with no globs. Also, quite inexpensive as well!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad that this product is available with Amazon! I will continue to order it.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Neurtogena products, but this one is not up to their usual standard. It is quite oily looking and you always have a feeling that something is layered on your face.&lt;br /&gt;As well as it you not rub it very well into your face you have stripes here and there, not the look I was going for. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> does what I wanted and moisturizes well.  Give it a go, you will be please with it I believe so.</li>
    <li> This is a great everyday moisturizer with a a bit of tint....sunscreen also.  I use it almost every day.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Great Product at a good price!</li>
    <li> Love it! Just enough color to give me a bit of a glow. I wear this every day, no noticeable scent and it makes my skin feel great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a number of years and like how it feels on my face...not greasy. The sunscreen works great. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think Neutrogena made this anymore.  I&#x27;ve never found anything else like it.  It provides moisture AND tint, which is honestly something I haven&#x27;t found in other tinted moisturizers; I feel like you either get one or the other!</li>
    <li> Moisturizer with a tint and SPF 30 protection. Great for running errands</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t found this in the stores lately, not sure why.  I love this, it is light and not greasy.</li>
    <li> YUCK! I am really starting to think many of these rave reviews are fake, because go on over to Makeupalley and everyone else hates this product as well. I have never in my life actually thrown away a full product, until this one. It was literally unusable. It made my face look muddy, not natural at all. And it also clumped up around my eyebrows and the sides of my face, even though I didn&#x27;t use that much! It just looked so bad, I didn&#x27;t feel guilty about throwing it in the garbage at all. Buy at your own risk</li>
    <li> This make-up is the best.</li>
    <li> I use this product a lot and love that I can get it from Amazon.  Good price and shipping for me.</li>
    <li> I am very fair and bought the light tinted moisturizer and am very happy with it. It is almost weightless and adds just enough color that I don&#x27;t even use  powder or foundation with it. I will definitely buy it again</li>
    <li> works great love it, hard to find in stores, expensive but worth it, thanks.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for some time &amp; really liked this item in the past, however the tube I received is NOT broad spectrum like it is shown in the picture. This is a deal breaker for me.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, is odor free and hypoallergenic perfect. I had being using this product for several years already</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know whether I am paler than I thought or this is darker than I expected but it adds more color than I anticipated. The moisture is perfect, little or no shine.</li>
    <li> i rarely wear makeup.  when i squeezed this out of the tube i thought wow this looks like my liquid foundation not like an every day moisturizer but i tried it anyway.  if i didnt wash my hands after i applied it it got under my fingernails and because it was still on my hands it got on my white tshirt.  after i let it soak in for awhile i still had to touch it up with some powder because it looked oily and it also felt a little heavy which is why i dont really wear makeup.  i think ill stick with oil of olay</li>
    <li> Very happy with product! Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> This was way too light for me, so I gave it away. Sorry. &amp;#60;*&amp;#62;&amp;#60;~~~~~~~~~~~</li>
    <li> It was nice to find a moisturizer with 30 SPF.  I think it provides good sun protection, but I feel like I need to put more moisturizer under it as my skin still feels dry if I just use it.</li>
    <li> I read some of the other reviews. My advice: I mix the tinted product with a really creamy, fairly cheap moisturizer. That way it spreads really well, covers and protects my skin. I mix a bunch in a jar with a lid so I only have one cream to apply in the morning and go. Travels that way well also. It also makes the product a bit lighter for those of us with fair skin.</li>
    <li> Throw this on to protect against sun damage and when I don&#x27;t have time for make up (it gives the skin a nice glow.).</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and it has always provided me with great protection. I also like the tint because I feel it gives me a tanned look.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Too bad it will no longer be produced.</li>
    <li> I loved it! I use it daily, and will definitely be buying again when this runs out. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> I get more compliments about my skin whenever I use this product. I have light freckles. When I  wear foundation it looks like I&#x27;m wearing a mask. No good. When I use this product it evens out my skin tone, gives me a little bit of color, and has sunscreen. It looks like nothing is on your skin, though. It lets &amp;#34;you&amp;#34; shine through! I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and I love it.  It is a nice moisturizer with a tint of color and the bonus is the SPF 30!</li>
    <li> I just did a musical and, while getting some basic makeup supplies, got this on a recommendation from a friend. It&#x27;s just enough color to even your face out but not look obvious. Nice!</li>
    <li> I keep reordering it because it&#x27;s noncomedigenic and just plain great. I used it as a moisturized every single day.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer for my sensitive skin. I love the light tint - it&#x27;s enough that I can go without any makeup.</li>
    <li> I wear this every day. Love it</li>
    <li> good product quick delivery</li>
    <li> This is the most wonderful product. It works beautifully as a combination moisturizer and foundation with the light tint. I would never buy an expensive high end foundation when this does the trick perfectly, plus is has the SPF 30 for protection. I hope Neutrogena always has this available.</li>
    <li> Very good and at a very good price. It really hidrates your skin. You definetly get value for money! I highly recomend this moisturizer!</li>
    <li> It goes on easily, and although it is a little dark for my extremely pale skin,it made a good base for light coverage of mineral makeup. I loved it at first, but noticed that after wearing it for a few hours my forehead would be very oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week of use, I had to stop. Even with blotting off the excess oil, I started to break out on my forehead, which isn&#x27;t normal for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer wasn&#x27;t for me, but it might work for someone with drier skin.</li>
    <li> wonderful tinted moisturizer with SPF</li>
