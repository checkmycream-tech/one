      <li>This stuff is great for your skin!</li>
      <li>but I always got the best results from Stridex.</li>
      <li>Alcohol-free, best medication for acne without a prescription?</li>
      <li>very good item for the price</li>
      <li>Good luck!</li>
      <li>LOL I had been using Clearasil, and I couldn&#x27;t afford Proactive.</li>
      <li>These pads do a great job at cleaning your face.</li>
      <li>They have done a great job in clearing my breakout.</li>
      <li>Below is a review for the Stridex: MAXIMUM pads; a great choice if you want maximum effort in combating oil, dirt and breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, so happy I purchased these.</li>
      <li>These wipes are a great find.</li>
      <li>But still, they seem to be working well, and they are a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works great under makeup.</li>
      <li>You may be happy you did.</li>
      <li>Stridex pads are great for acne.  </li>
      <li>They do a great job cleaning and put the salicylic acid acne medication on your skin.</li>
      <li>and they do a great job of cleaning my face when I am in a hurry.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this works for some people but skin is tricky so maybe a 3 pack wasn&#x27;t the best choice to start with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have to say that I though that placing the order from Spain would be more dificult, but the truth is that everything worked out perfect.</li>
      <li>Good value (pack of 3), and works well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;-Very good price</li>
      <li>Good</li>
      <li>Packages are in good condition.</li>
      <li>so excited to see the good results!!!!!!</li>
      <li>most of all -- it&#x27;s effective!</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>I think Oxy works better for my skin!</li>
      <li>You get maximum strength effort out of each pad and they do an amazing job at cleaning up your face.  </li>
      <li>Not commercialized, and it&#x27;s the kind of product that sits on the bottom row of the drugstore.</li>
      <li>This three pack is nice</li>
      <li>It is really nice.</li>
      <li>They have a light, pleasant smell to them as well.</li>
      <li>While I&#x27;ve always had excellent skin, this product completely eliminated visible sebaceous filaments, blackheads, and bumps.</li>
      <li>The product is great, though, and I very much appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t smell medicinal.</li>
      <li>So that means cleaning my skin more often.</li>
      <li>Sincerely, R.A. McDowell</li>
      <li>What impresses me the most is that they contain a lot of medication.</li>
      <li>The maximum pads do an outstanding job at preventing break outs, and cleaning your face and skin.  </li>
      <li>However, it is on the pricey side so if you can&#x27;t afford it, stridex is your next best option.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After more than a month of using, I can say that my acne is gone and the dryness is also gone.</li>
      <li>Also, i have noticed that i works better when used in the evening/night after you wash your face, however what worked for me might not work for everyone.</li>
      <li>This is a miracle in a bottle&#x3D;]</li>
      <li>not even prescription cream seems to make it better.</li>
      <li>I think the stridex seemed to work better for that.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this stuff.</li>
      <li>have used many cremes, ive been through differin, benzaclin, epiduo, over the counter benzoyl peroxide, and even had salicylic acid before.  </li>
      <li>read reviews and they all said that the stridex worked better than the C brand I have been purcharing for years for my son I used this brand growing up</li>
      <li>I love the Stridex pads.  </li>
      <li>, I should have known better.</li>
      <li>the better it worked.</li>
      <li>Stridex is my favorite.</li>
      <li>People usually lean towards the more popular and advertised brands, but I&#x27;ve tried many many different brands and products, and I can confidently say Stridex is the best of the best.</li>
      <li>it works great for me and leaves my face clear.</li>
      <li>Bought these due to Reddit&#x27;s r/SkincareAddiction community recommending them, and it&#x27;s one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
      <li>This is easily the must have pad for non-sensitive skin users.</li>
      <li>Easy to wipe on and throw away- seems to help my skin a lot also.</li>
      <li>&quot; so it is easy to take just one...</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>I recommend Paula&#x27;s Choice 2% BHA liquid if you want more gentle but still effective way to treat your skin.</li>
      <li>I feel like this formulation isn&#x27;t as strong as it used to be.</li>
      <li>Most importantly, this is far more effective than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>so half is perfect and now you have 540 uses for ~$11.</li>
      <li>This stuff keeps that area much more pleasant for basically the entire day.</li>
      <li>My skin is smooth and almost always blemish free.</li>
      <li>Of all the chemical exfoliants I&#x27;ve tried, this is by far the one that works best for keeping my skin clear and smooth</li>
      <li>The scars remain to this day (three months later) but they are fading and my skin looks great.  </li>
      <li>I have never been blackhead free.</li>
      <li>Skin feels smooth and clean afterward.</li>
      <li>It puts forth \\&quot;Maximum\\&quot; effort in the fight to maintain acne control and clean skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, Amazon offers such a great value for money!  </li>
      <li>and they really do clean your face</li>
      <li>I use them every evening to clean all the oil and dirt off my face from the day.  </li>
      <li>Out of every acne solution I&#x27;ve tried, and thats a lot, this is by far the best my whole face looks ten times better</li>
      <li>these are good, not only for acne but just to clean the skin --- the extra good thing about these is that they are \\&quot;indented\\</li>
      <li>This has a nice smell and seems to be pretty gentle on the skin, but it doesn&#x27;t work wonders for me.</li>
      <li>I read that salicylic acid was good for keratosis pilaris, the bumpy skin on the backs of upper arms.</li>
      <li>This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for excessive oily skin!  </li>
      <li>My skin makes oil so quickly, and</li>
      <li>after a minute to let my face dry off a bit, it feels very cool and nice, then i put on some over the counter 10% benzoyl peroxide.  </li>
      <li>It has become the most important step in my skincare routine and I notice an increase in breakouts, oil, and closed comedones if I skip using the pads for more than a couple of days.</li>
      <li>I have always had problem skin and tried tons of different products - this routine is so much cheaper and more effective.  </li>
      <li>I felt the difference, the fresh, clean feeling, RIGHT away.</li>
      <li>It is because of these better results I always keep a box on hand with my Sensitive skin variety.  </li>
      <li>trade off is worth it though.  </li>
      <li>I rarely write reviews</li>
      <li>I naturally have nicer skin and have never had an acne problem, but these work really well by keeping my face clean and pimple free!</li>
      <li>Packaging was just right as well.</li>
      <li>You need to try a smaller sample to make sure it is right for you and dont just take my word for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>The stinging and tingling sensation was very intense</li>
      <li>I used to have large pimples (the kind that hurt to touch) all over my face, but such inexpensive over the counter products have really made a difference for me.  </li>
      <li>but I usually pick up the Sensitive Skin or Maximum Strength varieties with either giving very good results.</li>
      <li>I started with wiping twice a day through maybe the first month.  </li>
      <li>It works and fast shipping!</li>
      <li>Cheap and efficient pads to help clear up acne.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t recommend these at all, but if you want to try them, please don&#x27;t buy a three pack first.</li>
      <li>They worked on literally the first use.</li>
      <li>They do exactly the job and do not make my face peel.</li>
      <li>They are pretty cheap and this order came with three boxes, but if you want the most bang for your buck you can cut these pads in half.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The product is not harsh, has a slight smell (pleasant, though), and is incredibly economical.</li>
      <li>Keeps me clean and clear.</li>
      <li>It seems to be effective at cleansing and drying out the active acne with problematic skin.</li>
      <li>again this is only the 2nd day which seems too good to be true, but I will be using these religiously now.</li>
      <li>so much so, that my glasses sometimes slip off my face.</li>
      <li>Thanks for your time folks.&lt;br</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re fast and you can feel them working.</li>
      <li>(depends on what&#x27;s on sale really)</li>
      <li>it is still very efffective.  </li>
      <li>These pads absolutely get rid of pimples.</li>
      <li>When it comes to treating acne, Stridex is very underrated.</li>
      <li>I immediately felt an almost burning sensation, but it wasn&#x27;t intense.</li>
      <li>and my skin is really thanking me now.</li>
      <li>use these pads VERY aggressively, twice a day.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m telling you this stuff really works and continues to work for me.  </li>
      <li>I dont get acne much</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin</li>
      <li>This product has been an absolute lifesaver for me.</li>
      <li>I only use this once-a-day the most, and I also think my skin developed a sort of immunity to it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also found it to be effective on the few occasions I&#x27;ve had a break-out.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I actually have sensitive skin but find the Maximum pads give better results (probably due to 1.5% more salicylic acid).  </li>
      <li>That stuff made my skin SUPER dry and irritated, which resulted in more oil production and left me with greasy, unflattering skin.</li>
      <li>I had originally purchased this for my teen daughter, but it works for moms, too!</li>
      <li>Not only does it clean your skin of oil and dirt, but after use you can feel the medicated pad continue to work.  </li>
      <li>My face does not dry out as a result and my occasional acne is under control when I use the Stridex acne pads. :)</li>
      <li>I tried stridex when I couldn&#x27;t get the usual at another store and over time by the end of the bottle liked them.</li>
      <li>Not bad for a pack of 3 BIG bottles.</li>
      <li>Well fast forward to my new job</li>
      <li>Now I typically wipe once a day whenever I feel I need it most.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have severe acne, but as I get older (I&#x27;m 39)</li>
      <li>If I eat the wrong things which positively cause pimples, if I think of it, I use the pads to successfully prevent them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll get one or two large and sensitive blemishes a month that don&#x27;t seem to go away no matter what I do-</li>
      <li>and they&#x27;ve been working very well so far.</li>
      <li>As many have mentioned, they are not easy to find in stores and you cannot beat the price on Amazon.</li>
      <li>and I was basically not getting any new acne.  </li>
      <li>I use Differin, which can make my skin more sensitive to harsh products, but this stuff doesnt bother my skin at all.</li>
      <li>As a guy and someone who&#x27;s very busy, I never have the time or desire to sit in the bathroom applying 10 creams and face washes twice a day.</li>
      <li>Now in winter I use it more occasionally, but I totally recommend (but, reminder*, patch-test to see if it works the same for you as our skin is not all alike).</li>
      <li>The only solution is to do whatever I can to prevent them in the first place.</li>
      <li>Not sure why but it is wetter so perhaps making better contact with the skin through the hair.</li>
      <li>I am very lazy at night, but I somehow find a way to clean my skin quickly with this product.</li>
      <li>I used the product in the past, stopped for about 4 years and just picked up some more.  </li>
      <li>My skin is pretty resilient and not easily irritated, with that being said I started with one a day but quickly moved up to two.</li>
      <li>When it comes to dealing with a mild outbreak, I found the sensitive pads didn&#x27;t do enough; or required an additional pad later on in the day to start getting results.  </li>
      <li>You get so many pads for hardly any money, it isn&#x27;t that drying, and</li>
      <li>But I used the pads on my legs and it&#x27;s helped clear it up quite a bit.</li>
      <li>-Always clear up my acne&lt;br</li>
      <li>Keeps my skin clear.</li>
      <li>I have even used prescription medications and ointments from the dermatologist, but nothing has kept my skin clear.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and can get away with using these once a day with no issue.</li>
      <li>Although it did work for me for a while, it didn&#x27;t completely cure my skin.</li>
      <li>was worried that these pads might be too drying for my skin, but so far that hasn&#x27;t been a problem at all.</li>
      <li>those with extremely sensitive skin might want to consider that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>I am 32 years old and suffer from stress induced acne.  </li>
      <li>and they make your skin feel refreshed and soft.</li>
      <li>Throughout my adult life, I&#x27;ve had pimples pop up on a weekly basis.</li>
      <li>I purchased the Stridex pads for my 14 year old son.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin that is prone to irritation.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I was using it daily, and it really dries out the skin, but it did not do anything to help with the acne.  </li>
      <li>After a week of using these pads twice a day along with a moisturiser, my skin was completely cleared up.</li>
      <li>When using this product you will notice that it dries your skin out right after (not too much but a noticeable amount) -- i would advice waiting a few minutes</li>
      <li>But just ONE pad, used to clean myself thoroughly with one side to wipe off the extra oil, and then with the other side to polish it up, leaves my entire face feeling fresh and clear, and to such a degree that you can feel the difference both in your face, and with your fingers.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always had EXTREMELY oily skin that was very acne-prone, so after much research, I decided to try this product.</li>
      <li>because this stuff has a tendency to dry out your skin quickly which can be a good thing but could be worse if you use other medications or creams on your face</li>
      <li>I am too lazy to wash my face and these wipes have been a great help in clearing up my dull skin.</li>
      <li>Even using them twice a day, these will last you a long time, which makes them worth the money.</li>
      <li>Overall it did help clean out my pores and shrink them, which results in less clogged pores and pimples.</li>
      <li>/&gt;OVERALL if you have sensitive skin I would use this product sparingly, and use the Sensitive variety for daily use (Use maximum pads as needed to control a breakout).  </li>
      <li>My skin has been been prone to breakouts either from hormones or from stress for years and no other product has worked like these stridex pads.</li>
      <li>This may be thought of as a teenage skincare product but honestly it&#x27;s an adult acne lifesaver.</li>
      <li>I use them as an adult, just recently, for nights.</li>
      <li>Like many people, I have had trouble with clear skin in the past.</li>
      <li>I use the Stridex pads at least twice-daily to clean my face.  </li>
      <li>I have used all different products to treat my skin, from a teenage now as an adult.</li>
      <li>Stridex does not dry out my skin.</li>
      <li>I generally don&#x27;t use the entire pad</li>
      <li>When I wake up I wash my face with a gentle soap and then SCRUB down my face.  </li>
      <li>Additionally, within a week of using this product, the slight acne I had developed on my cheeks as a result of stress completely disappeared.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Gentle enough for daily use, which I continued even after my skin calmed down.</li>

<li> Thanks for your time folks.&lt;br</li>
<li> They&#x27;re fast and you can feel them working.</li>
<li> (depends on what&#x27;s on sale really)</li>
<li> it is still very efffective.  </li>
<li> These pads absolutely get rid of pimples.</li>
<li> When it comes to treating acne, Stridex is very underrated.</li>
<li> I immediately felt an almost burning sensation, but it wasn&#x27;t intense.</li>
<li> and my skin is really thanking me now.</li>
<li> use these pads VERY aggressively, twice a day.  </li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;m telling you this stuff really works and continues to work for me.  </li>
<li> I dont get acne much</li>
<li> I have very oily skin</li>
<li> This product has been an absolute lifesaver for me.</li>
<li> I only use this once-a-day the most, and I also think my skin developed a sort of immunity to it</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve also found it to be effective on the few occasions I&#x27;ve had a break-out.</li>
<li> /&gt;I actually have sensitive skin but find the Maximum pads give better results (probably due to 1.5% more salicylic acid).  </li>
<li> That stuff made my skin SUPER dry and irritated, which resulted in more oil production and left me with greasy, unflattering skin.</li>
<li> I had originally purchased this for my teen daughter, but it works for moms, too!</li>
<li> Not only does it clean your skin of oil and dirt, but after use you can feel the medicated pad continue to work.  </li>
<li> My face does not dry out as a result and my occasional acne is under control when I use the Stridex acne pads. :)</li>
<li> I tried stridex when I couldn&#x27;t get the usual at another store and over time by the end of the bottle liked them.</li>
<li> Not bad for a pack of 3 BIG bottles.</li>
<li> Well fast forward to my new job</li>
<li> Now I typically wipe once a day whenever I feel I need it most.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have severe acne, but as I get older (I&#x27;m 39)</li>
<li> If I eat the wrong things which positively cause pimples, if I think of it, I use the pads to successfully prevent them.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll get one or two large and sensitive blemishes a month that don&#x27;t seem to go away no matter what I do-</li>
<li> and they&#x27;ve been working very well so far.</li>
<li> As many have mentioned, they are not easy to find in stores and you cannot beat the price on Amazon.</li>
<li> and I was basically not getting any new acne.  </li>
<li> I use Differin, which can make my skin more sensitive to harsh products, but this stuff doesnt bother my skin at all.</li>
<li> As a guy and someone who&#x27;s very busy, I never have the time or desire to sit in the bathroom applying 10 creams and face washes twice a day.</li>
<li> Now in winter I use it more occasionally, but I totally recommend (but, reminder*, patch-test to see if it works the same for you as our skin is not all alike).</li>
<li> The only solution is to do whatever I can to prevent them in the first place.</li>
<li> Not sure why but it is wetter so perhaps making better contact with the skin through the hair.</li>
<li> I am very lazy at night, but I somehow find a way to clean my skin quickly with this product.</li>
<li> I used the product in the past, stopped for about 4 years and just picked up some more.  </li>
<li> My skin is pretty resilient and not easily irritated, with that being said I started with one a day but quickly moved up to two.</li>
<li> When it comes to dealing with a mild outbreak, I found the sensitive pads didn&#x27;t do enough; or required an additional pad later on in the day to start getting results.  </li>
<li> You get so many pads for hardly any money, it isn&#x27;t that drying, and</li>
<li> But I used the pads on my legs and it&#x27;s helped clear it up quite a bit.</li>
<li> -Always clear up my acne&lt;br</li>
<li> Keeps my skin clear.</li>
<li> I have even used prescription medications and ointments from the dermatologist, but nothing has kept my skin clear.</li>
<li> I have sensitive skin and can get away with using these once a day with no issue.</li>
<li> Although it did work for me for a while, it didn&#x27;t completely cure my skin.</li>
<li> was worried that these pads might be too drying for my skin, but so far that hasn&#x27;t been a problem at all.</li>
<li> those with extremely sensitive skin might want to consider that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
<li> I am 32 years old and suffer from stress induced acne.  </li>
<li> and they make your skin feel refreshed and soft.</li>
<li> Throughout my adult life, I&#x27;ve had pimples pop up on a weekly basis.</li>
<li> I purchased the Stridex pads for my 14 year old son.</li>
<li> I have sensitive skin that is prone to irritation.</li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
<li> I was using it daily, and it really dries out the skin, but it did not do anything to help with the acne.  </li>
<li> After a week of using these pads twice a day along with a moisturiser, my skin was completely cleared up.</li>
<li> When using this product you will notice that it dries your skin out right after (not too much but a noticeable amount) -- i would advice waiting a few minutes</li>
<li> But just ONE pad, used to clean myself thoroughly with one side to wipe off the extra oil, and then with the other side to polish it up, leaves my entire face feeling fresh and clear, and to such a degree that you can feel the difference both in your face, and with your fingers.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve always had EXTREMELY oily skin that was very acne-prone, so after much research, I decided to try this product.</li>
<li> because this stuff has a tendency to dry out your skin quickly which can be a good thing but could be worse if you use other medications or creams on your face</li>
<li> I am too lazy to wash my face and these wipes have been a great help in clearing up my dull skin.</li>
<li> Even using them twice a day, these will last you a long time, which makes them worth the money.</li>
<li> Overall it did help clean out my pores and shrink them, which results in less clogged pores and pimples.</li>
<li> /&gt;OVERALL if you have sensitive skin I would use this product sparingly, and use the Sensitive variety for daily use (Use maximum pads as needed to control a breakout).  </li>
<li> My skin has been been prone to breakouts either from hormones or from stress for years and no other product has worked like these stridex pads.</li>
<li> This may be thought of as a teenage skincare product but honestly it&#x27;s an adult acne lifesaver.</li>
<li> I use them as an adult, just recently, for nights.</li>
<li> Like many people, I have had trouble with clear skin in the past.</li>
<li> I use the Stridex pads at least twice-daily to clean my face.  </li>
<li> I have used all different products to treat my skin, from a teenage now as an adult.</li>
<li> Stridex does not dry out my skin.</li>
<li> I generally don&#x27;t use the entire pad</li>
<li> When I wake up I wash my face with a gentle soap and then SCRUB down my face.  </li>
<li> Additionally, within a week of using this product, the slight acne I had developed on my cheeks as a result of stress completely disappeared.&lt;br</li>
<li> Gentle enough for daily use, which I continued even after my skin calmed down.</li>
<li> This stuff is so good that even if I&#x27;m feel awful and skip a cleaning, another outbreak doesn&#x27;t happen right away.</li>
<li> (you can actually see the dirt on the pad after wiping your face!)and they do not burn at all like some other medicated pads do, however they won&#x27;t help your skin clear up by themselves.</li>
<li> And I use these also behind my ears and along my hair line and just into it on the back of my neck for mild psorisias.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve become more unhappy with the Walmart stores in the upper north west Kalispell MT and Northern ID.</li>
<li> However, for someone like me with sensitive skin it comes at the cost of having slightly dried skin or sometimes even irritated</li>
<li> The stridex does what it says it would, eliminated closed comedones so that there won&#x27;t be future acne.</li>
<li> I would recommend this product to anyone, as long as you follow up with some type of lotion because the pads could dry out your skin.</li>
<li> /&gt;Within a day of using these (just a light sweep over my face in the shower a few minutes before scrubbing my face with Purpose soap), the blemish I have been fighting with for the past three weeks DRIED UP and went away.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t expect overnight results; these should be used every other day to help prevent future breakouts.</li>
<li> It stops the breakouts but doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
<li> I always will have troubled skin, but at the end of the night, this is the EASIEST product to use to clean your skin.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out around my nose or skin.</li>
<li> Within a few days, my skin was clear, and not only that, but my skin wasn&#x27;t dry and tight, like the Clearasil tended to do.</li>
<li> I had never suffered from dry skin before and this was the driest of the dry!</li>
<li> This store will not pay for return shipping so its not worth shipping them back for a refund.</li>
<li> If I &#x27;scrub&#x27; an area, or concentrate on it for a long time, it may dry out the following day but a little moisturizer helps with that.</li>
<li> Your skin will be less dry when you only do it once a</li>
<li> Will be using this product for a long time!!</li>
<li> Wait for your face to dry before putting on moisturizer!</li>
<li> He has the occasional break out and this seems to be an easier solution for him rather than the cleanser and toner that I previously purchased for him</li>
<li> I&#x27;m so glad Stridex took out the irritating ingredients like alcohol that can dry your skin and make breakouts worse.    </li>
<li> Clearasil was leaving my skin VERY dry, especially when I started needing to use the pads a few times a day.</li>
<li> I have used hard and soft soaps for washing my face.  </li>
<li> In addition, my skin isn&#x27;t nearly as oily in the late afternoons as it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> This 3 pack deal is a total waste of money.</li>
<li> A bit rougher but the liquid seems to stay wet all the way through the 90 pad container.</li>
<li> After I&#x27;m done with my face, I can usually also apply a little bit to my shoulders and upper back, which has done wonders to clearing those areas as well.</li>
<li> I have used Stri-Dex medicated pads by themselves and with other products and must say that they do remove a lot of dirt and oil,</li>
<li> I usually have to use two to cover my entire face thoroughly.</li>
<li> when used like 3x a week, otherwise I find that my face is a little bit too dry.</li>
<li> I have not had a single breakout, and when I went off it for a month I had trouble keeping the zits at bay.</li>
<li> It has menthol in it which can be irritating if you have sensitive skin.</li>
<li> So when wally world let me down yet again...</li>
<li> Use it once a day or every other day!</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Clearasil worked too, it was just VERY astringent, and dried out my skin</li>
<li> They don&#x27;t sting or irritate, all you feel is a slight tingle.</li>
<li> I found that the less I used it (now once a week)</li>
<li> , when i looked closely at my face I could see all the little blackheads in my pores, but now there are much less.  </li>
<li> I made a decision to go ahead and just try the Stridex for a little while.</li>
<li> I have been plagued with folliculitis (ingrown hair bumps) on my legs since I was really little.</li>
<li> but the item you are looking for is blank half the time or all the time and or worse no longer even has a place.</li>
<li> When using once a day my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out but when using twice a day my face would get a little dry on those really cold dry days.</li>
<li> Stridex makes a few varieties of pads</li>
<li> This is the pad I recommend to people who do not have dried skin.  </li>
<li> Again, I do wash my face a few minutes</li>
<li> , the pads are tiny and thin.</li>
<li> Give it a shot if you have acne trouble.  </li>
<li> Well, okay, if I HAD to come up with a complaint I would say that it&#x27;s slightly annoying that it&#x27;s so difficult to get only ONE pad at a time--</li>
<li> I always thought medicated pads were a joke as I used OxyClean in the past with unfavorable results, and then gave them a try a few years ago to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Also when I applied it the skin felt very tight and I could feel the layer of product on my skin.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if he was joking or not...).</li>
<li> I noticed some small acne started fading, so I kept to the routine.</li>
<li> I used the Aveeno salicylic acid pads for years, but they seems to do only a mediocre job at preventing blemishes.</li>
<li> /&gt;-I usually use them twice per day but sometimes I&#x27;ll just use one if my skin starts to feel dry&lt;</li>
<li> They&#x27;re also significantly less expensive than their counterparts from other companies.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t do the worst taking care of my skin, though I do have a blemish or two from time to time, but this made me super down.</li>
<li> I will suck this one up as a stupid choice on my part, and order these pads from the usual &#x27;&#x27;online drugstore&#x27;&#x27; I normally do.</li>
<li> So if you&#x27;re having reactions to this, I recommend sticking it out but cutting back!</li>
<li> but I know how painful and embarrassing acne can be for an adult.  </li>
<li> That results, without washing my face at least 2-3 times during my work day, in oily skin on my nose and area under my eyes.  </li>
<li> Since I&#x27;ve become sick, my skin was producing more oil, and it was driving me MAD!</li>
<li> I tried the Oxy stuff and was so horribly disappointed that I kicked myself for having tried anything different.</li>
<li> any case, I used this twice a day with after washing my face and followed up with lotion, but after stopping I can only say it made my acne worse. :(</li>
<li> and my acne was worse.</li>
<li> After I stopped breastfeeding (sorry for TMI)</li>
<li> My doctor prescribed me this cream that was absolutely useless (and he told me that I had to use it</li>
<li> but when I went to college in my mid twenties and started taking a lot of credit hours and the work piled up I began to suffer from terrible acne.  </li>
<li> You cannot go wrong here.</li>
<li> After a few times of using it, I noticed I was unable to put on foundation or concealer without horrible flaking</li>
<li> They made me break out like crazy, even after two weeks of use.</li>
<li> so I can pull it out and use whenever I feel dirty or oily.</li>
<li> I never had bad skin in my teens</li>
<li> About a week into it I noticed that the pain was not as bad.  </li>
<li> Eventually the dryness and irritation became so bad I had to stop using the product.</li>
<li> Just as painful and annoying as ever.  </li>
<li> and it was so bad that it was very painful.  </li>
<li> and it just looked terrible.</li>
<li> Horrible decision</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;m sure this works for some people but skin is tricky so maybe a 3 pack wasn&#x27;t the best choice to start with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I used this twice a day with after washing my face and followed up with lotion, but after stopping I can only say it made my acne worse. :(</li>
    <li> Like many people, I have had trouble with clear skin in the past. Since I&#x27;ve become sick, my skin was producing more oil, and it was driving me MAD! LOL I had been using Clearasil, and I couldn&#x27;t afford Proactive. Clearasil was leaving my skin VERY dry, especially when I started needing to use the pads a few times a day. If I feel my face is oily, and I leave it, I&#x27;m just asking for pimples. So that means cleaning my skin more often. I made a decision to go ahead and just try the Stridex for a little while. I felt the difference, the fresh, clean feeling, RIGHT away. Within a few days, my skin was clear, and not only that, but my skin wasn&#x27;t dry and tight, like the Clearasil tended to do. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Clearasil worked too, it was just VERY astringent, and dried out my skin quickly.&lt;br /&gt;  This stuff is so good that even if I&#x27;m feel awful and skip a cleaning, another outbreak doesn&#x27;t happen right away. My skin makes oil so quickly, and so much so, that my glasses sometimes slip off my face. But just ONE pad, used to clean myself thoroughly with one side to wipe off the extra oil, and then with the other side to polish it up, leaves my entire face feeling fresh and clear, and to such a degree that you can feel the difference both in your face, and with your fingers. The oil is just GONE. So seriously folks, if you&#x27;ve been a loyal fan of another acne or daily facial routine, and it&#x27;s just not doing the trick anymore, then give this a try. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;  Thanks for your time folks.&lt;br /&gt;  Sincerely, R.A. McDowell</li>
    <li> After I stopped breastfeeding (sorry for TMI) my skin totally rebelled on me. I don&#x27;t do the worst taking care of my skin, though I do have a blemish or two from time to time, but this made me super down. I went on Reddit, saw this as a recommendation, and bought it. Immediate improvement and total dissipation of skin-related sadness. Gentle enough for daily use, which I continued even after my skin calmed down. Now in winter I use it more occasionally, but I totally recommend (but, reminder*, patch-test to see if it works the same for you as our skin is not all alike). Even the husband uses it from time to time.</li>
    <li> I get this for under $5/jar at the grocery story. You&#x27;d think ordering online and in bulk it would be cheaper.</li>
    <li> Bought this product 2 weeks ago after a recent breakout. As a guy and someone who&#x27;s very busy, I never have the time or desire to sit in the bathroom applying 10 creams and face washes twice a day. These pads do a great job at cleaning your face. They&#x27;re fast and you can feel them working. Skin feels smooth and clean afterward. They don&#x27;t sting or irritate, all you feel is a slight tingle. They have done a great job in clearing my breakout. What impresses me the most is that they contain a lot of medication. After I&#x27;m done with my face, I can usually also apply a little bit to my shoulders and upper back, which has done wonders to clearing those areas as well. Even using them twice a day, these will last you a long time, which makes them worth the money. They&#x27;re also significantly less expensive than their counterparts from other companies.</li>
    <li> This 3 pack deal is a total waste of money. The pads I received expired 2 months ago. They were all brown and foul smelling open opening. This store will not pay for return shipping so its not worth shipping them back for a refund. I will suck this one up as a stupid choice on my part, and order these pads from the usual &#x27;&#x27;online drugstore&#x27;&#x27; I normally do.</li>
    <li> I have used Stri-Dex medicated pads by themselves and with other products and must say that they do remove a lot of dirt and oil, (you can actually see the dirt on the pad after wiping your face!)and they do not burn at all like some other medicated pads do, however they won&#x27;t help your skin clear up by themselves. I use the pads along with Clearasil Ultra daily face wash. It works so well. My skin is smooth and almost always blemish free. I used to have large pimples (the kind that hurt to touch) all over my face, but such inexpensive over the counter products have really made a difference for me.  Try it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for your skin! Use it once a day or every other day! Helps get rid of redness and build up in pores.</li>
    <li> I have always had problem skin and tried tons of different products - this routine is so much cheaper and more effective.  It has changed my skin so dramatically I feel compelled to share it with others!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wash face with Cerave cleanser&lt;br /&gt;wipe face with stridex pad (red box)&lt;br /&gt;follow up with Cerave moisturizing cream</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used various brands of medicated pads for years. I tend to stick with Stridex or Oxy (depends on what&#x27;s on sale really) but I always got the best results from Stridex. Stridex makes a few varieties of pads but I usually pick up the Sensitive Skin or Maximum Strength varieties with either giving very good results. Below is a review for the Stridex: MAXIMUM pads; a great choice if you want maximum effort in combating oil, dirt and breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually have sensitive skin but find the Maximum pads give better results (probably due to 1.5% more salicylic acid).  It is because of these better results I always keep a box on hand with my Sensitive skin variety.  What I like about Maximum strength is that you can feel the pad working.  Not only does it clean your skin of oil and dirt, but after use you can feel the medicated pad continue to work.  The maximum pads do an outstanding job at preventing break outs, and cleaning your face and skin.  However, for someone like me with sensitive skin it comes at the cost of having slightly dried skin or sometimes even irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trade off is worth it though.  When it comes to dealing with a mild outbreak, I found the sensitive pads didn&#x27;t do enough; or required an additional pad later on in the day to start getting results.  With Maximum, it goes to work instantly to fight all that dirt and oil.  This is the pad I recommend to people who do not have dried skin.  It puts forth \\&quot;Maximum\\&quot; effort in the fight to maintain acne control and clean skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL if you have sensitive skin I would use this product sparingly, and use the Sensitive variety for daily use (Use maximum pads as needed to control a breakout).  If you have normal, average skin well then maximum is the way to go I think.  You get maximum strength effort out of each pad and they do an amazing job at cleaning up your face.  This is easily the must have pad for non-sensitive skin users.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;ve cleared up some of my acne. It stings quite a bit-of course, since it&#x27;s \\&quot;maximum\\&quot; strength, and sometimes dries out my skin-but it has helped cleared up my acne.    Also! I have been plagued with folliculitis (ingrown hair bumps) on my legs since I was really little. My doctor prescribed me this cream that was absolutely useless (and he told me that I had to use it \\&quot;for the rest of my life\\&quot;. I&#x27;m not sure if he was joking or not...). I&#x27;ve also tried exfoliating...etc, nothing worked. But I used the pads on my legs and it&#x27;s helped clear it up quite a bit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 29 and still dealing with oily skin, acne, and clogged pores. Of all the chemical exfoliants I&#x27;ve tried, this is by far the one that works best for keeping my skin clear and smooth and it&#x27;s only a couple of bucks for a box. I have sensitive skin and can get away with using these once a day with no issue. It has become the most important step in my skincare routine and I notice an increase in breakouts, oil, and closed comedones if I skip using the pads for more than a couple of days. This may be thought of as a teenage skincare product but honestly it&#x27;s an adult acne lifesaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for an alcohol-free toner with 2% salicylic acid. If you&#x27;re just like me,this is it. It stops the breakouts but doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin. I use it twice or thrice a day. Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> despite its maximum strength - the solution does not stink your face (since the company remove alcohol from its ingredients)and it is still very efffective.  we have used this product for over 25 years and that just about sums it up on how we feel about this product.  You need to try a smaller sample to make sure it is right for you and dont just take my word for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Amazon offers such a great value for money!  Packaging was just right as well.</li>
    <li> I received this item on time, and the 3-pack of Stridex pads also came with a three-pack of blistex chapstick.  The pads work well on my acne, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Good value (pack of 3), and works well. Easy to wipe on and throw away- seems to help my skin a lot also.</li>
    <li> These pads absolutely get rid of pimples. Once applied, my pimple will be gone in 1.5 days. If I eat the wrong things which positively cause pimples, if I think of it, I use the pads to successfully prevent them. Remember that commercial: &amp;#34;Come over to my pad, Stridex medicated pads.&amp;#34; Try them, you&#x27;ll like them.</li>
    <li> When it comes to treating acne, Stridex is very underrated. Not commercialized, and it&#x27;s the kind of product that sits on the bottom row of the drugstore. People usually lean towards the more popular and advertised brands, but I&#x27;ve tried many many different brands and products, and I can confidently say Stridex is the best of the best. You get so many pads for hardly any money, it isn&#x27;t that drying, and most of all -- it&#x27;s effective! My acne vanished within a week. I notice a difference in 24 hours. I&#x27;m so, so happy I purchased these.</li>
    <li> The stridex does what it says it would, eliminated closed comedones so that there won&#x27;t be future acne. Although it did work for me for a while, it didn&#x27;t completely cure my skin. It has menthol in it which can be irritating if you have sensitive skin. I recommend Paula&#x27;s Choice 2% BHA liquid if you want more gentle but still effective way to treat your skin. However, it is on the pricey side so if you can&#x27;t afford it, stridex is your next best option.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had EXTREMELY oily skin that was very acne-prone, so after much research, I decided to try this product. The instructions say to use morning and night, and that is what I did. I immediately felt an almost burning sensation, but it wasn&#x27;t intense. I noticed some small acne started fading, so I kept to the routine. After a few times of using it, I noticed I was unable to put on foundation or concealer without horrible flaking and it just looked terrible. I had never suffered from dry skin before and this was the driest of the dry! So I put on vaseline at night and cut back on the Stridex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After more than a month of using, I can say that my acne is gone and the dryness is also gone. I only use this once-a-day the most, and I also think my skin developed a sort of immunity to it, I guess? Because I no longer feel the burning sensation when using it either. So if you&#x27;re having reactions to this, I recommend sticking it out but cutting back! Good luck!</li>
    <li> So i decided to try these after reading all the praise only from bloggers.  Overall it did help clean out my pores and shrink them, which results in less clogged pores and pimples. When using this product you will notice that it dries your skin out right after (not too much but a noticeable amount) -- i would advice waiting a few minutes (5-10) then applying a moisturizer or a night cream. Also, i have noticed that i works better when used in the evening/night after you wash your face, however what worked for me might not work for everyone.</li>
    <li> Out of every acne solution I&#x27;ve tried, and thats a lot, this is by far the best my whole face looks ten times better then it did a week ago. This is a miracle in a bottle&#x3D;]</li>
    <li> these are good, not only for acne but just to clean the skin --- the extra good thing about these is that they are \\&quot;indented\\&quot; so it is easy to take just one...</li>
    <li> These wipes are a great find. As many have mentioned, they are not easy to find in stores and you cannot beat the price on Amazon. I use them as an adult, just recently, for nights. I am too lazy to wash my face and these wipes have been a great help in clearing up my dull skin. I find they are gentl and non-drying. They have a light, pleasant smell to them as well. My only wish is that they come in a subscribe and save option.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have severe acne, but as I get older (I&#x27;m 39) I&#x27;ll get one or two large and sensitive blemishes a month that don&#x27;t seem to go away no matter what I do- not even prescription cream seems to make it better. The only solution is to do whatever I can to prevent them in the first place. I used the Aveeno salicylic acid pads for years, but they seems to do only a mediocre job at preventing blemishes. So I decided to go with the 2% salicylic acid in the Stridex pads and see what happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a day of using these (just a light sweep over my face in the shower a few minutes before scrubbing my face with Purpose soap), the blemish I have been fighting with for the past three weeks DRIED UP and went away. In addition, my skin isn&#x27;t nearly as oily in the late afternoons as it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried that these pads might be too drying for my skin, but so far that hasn&#x27;t been a problem at all. Again, I do wash my face a few minutes *after* I use the pad. The pad makes me skin tingle and it&#x27;s almost a relief to wash that off, so those with extremely sensitive skin might want to consider that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the pads are tiny and thin. I usually have to use two to cover my entire face thoroughly. But still, they seem to be working well, and they are a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> What I like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. value for money. (a pack of 3 boxes)&lt;br /&gt;2. effective.&lt;br /&gt;3. does not irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve become more unhappy with the Walmart stores in the upper north west Kalispell MT and Northern ID. They seem to have lots of stuff on a shelf but the item you are looking for is blank half the time or all the time and or worse no longer even has a place. Clearasel pads are one and I couldn&#x27;t even find Stridex. I tried stridex when I couldn&#x27;t get the usual at another store and over time by the end of the bottle liked them. A bit rougher but the liquid seems to stay wet all the way through the 90 pad container. And I use these also behind my ears and along my hair line and just into it on the back of my neck for mild psorisias. I think the stridex seemed to work better for that. Not sure why but it is wetter so perhaps making better contact with the skin through the hair. So when wally world let me down yet again...I looked to mail order here on Amazon. And viola...three pack which for me is 5-6 month supply.</li>
    <li> Well, okay, if I HAD to come up with a complaint I would say that it&#x27;s slightly annoying that it&#x27;s so difficult to get only ONE pad at a time-- they stick together! The product is great, though, and I very much appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t smell medicinal. I can use these pads after washing my face twice a day with no problem. If I &#x27;scrub&#x27; an area, or concentrate on it for a long time, it may dry out the following day but a little moisturizer helps with that.</li>
    <li> Change my life. Try these. I use on my face and body daily.</li>
    <li> Love this! I actually use it for my bull terrier that has a bald spot on his tail and an expert told me to get Stridex and use daily...so excited to see the good results!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this stuff. I use Differin, which can make my skin more sensitive to harsh products, but this stuff doesnt bother my skin at all. I&#x27;m so glad Stridex took out the irritating ingredients like alcohol that can dry your skin and make breakouts worse.    I use this to keep blackheads on my nose under control. What I really like is that it is a liquid so it doesnt feel heavy or greasy on your skin. Works great under makeup.</li>
    <li> Alcohol-free, best medication for acne without a prescription? I&#x27;ll take 3!&lt;br /&gt;I use this, and Cerave foaming cleanser, and Cerave cream in the tub and my skin is really thanking me now.</li>
    <li> I used to use these both morning and night when I was a teenager and my acne was worse. Now I only use them once a night and acne is never a problem. When using once a day my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out but when using twice a day my face would get a little dry on those really cold dry days.</li>
    <li> this is only the 2nd day so i hope i am not speaking too soon.  but these pads literally wiped away my problems&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used many cremes, ive been through differin, benzaclin, epiduo, over the counter benzoyl peroxide, and even had salicylic acid before.  I have used hard and soft soaps for washing my face.  I even had an antibiotic pill.  then i found this...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these pads VERY aggressively, twice a day.  When I wake up I wash my face with a gentle soap and then SCRUB down my face.  it works out the blackheads and lets the medicine get in.  after a minute to let my face dry off a bit, it feels very cool and nice, then i put on some over the counter 10% benzoyl peroxide.  I do that same drill after i get home from work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;before, when i looked closely at my face I could see all the little blackheads in my pores, but now there are much less.  The outbreaks I currently had have immediately faded.  again this is only the 2nd day which seems too good to be true, but I will be using these religiously now.</li>
    <li> I feel it work after I put it on, and it seems to have made a difference.</li>
    <li> -Always clear up my acne&lt;br /&gt;-I usually use them twice per day but sometimes I&#x27;ll just use one if my skin starts to feel dry&lt;br /&gt;-Very good price</li>
    <li> My skin is pretty resilient and not easily irritated, with that being said I started with one a day but quickly moved up to two. I use this between my CeraVe foaming cleanser and my CeraVe moisturizer and they&#x27;ve been working very well so far. They are pretty cheap and this order came with three boxes, but if you want the most bang for your buck you can cut these pads in half. I generally don&#x27;t use the entire pad so half is perfect and now you have 540 uses for ~$11.</li>
    <li> Good when used like 3x a week, otherwise I find that my face is a little bit too dry. Tip: Wait for your face to dry before putting on moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I am 32 years old and suffer from stress induced acne.  I never had bad skin in my teens but when I went to college in my mid twenties and started taking a lot of credit hours and the work piled up I began to suffer from terrible acne.  It was almost all on my forehead and it was so bad that it was very painful.  Well fast forward to my new job and here it is again.  Just as painful and annoying as ever.  So I bought these pads hoping they would help.  About a week into it I noticed that the pain was not as bad.  A month after and I was basically not getting any new acne.  The scars remain to this day (three months later) but they are fading and my skin looks great.  I started with wiping twice a day through maybe the first month.  I shower in the morning, then wiped once at work after lunch then once before bed.  This three pack is nice so you can leave one at work and keep the rest at home.  Now I typically wipe once a day whenever I feel I need it most.  Your skin will be less dry when you only do it once a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m telling you this stuff really works and continues to work for me.  I rarely write reviews but I know how painful and embarrassing acne can be for an adult.  It has increased my confidence and quality of life and that you can&#x27;t put a price on.  Give it a shot if you have acne trouble.  You may be happy you did.</li>
    <li> I just stopped using Proactiv because of the price and as soon as I stopped my skin broke out and looked oily again so I got these. I use them twice a day and they really do clean your face and they make your skin feel refreshed and soft.</li>
    <li> Bought these due to Reddit&#x27;s r/SkincareAddiction community recommending them, and it&#x27;s one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made. While I&#x27;ve always had excellent skin, this product completely eliminated visible sebaceous filaments, blackheads, and bumps. Additionally, within a week of using this product, the slight acne I had developed on my cheeks as a result of stress completely disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is not harsh, has a slight smell (pleasant, though), and is incredibly economical. Most importantly, this is far more effective than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I feel like this formulation isn&#x27;t as strong as it used to be. Oh well, I like it none-the-less.</li>
    <li> I wish I had used these during my teenage years.  Throughout my adult life, I&#x27;ve had pimples pop up on a weekly basis. I always thought medicated pads were a joke as I used OxyClean in the past with unfavorable results, and then gave them a try a few years ago to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always thought Stridex was going to produce the same results and never bothered to try it, until a year ago.  Now I swear by it.  I have not had a single breakout, and when I went off it for a month I had trouble keeping the zits at bay. I definitely recommend this product if you are looking for a last resort.</li>
    <li> because this stuff has a tendency to dry out your skin quickly which can be a good thing but could be worse if you use other medications or creams on your face</li>
    <li> read reviews and they all said that the stridex worked better than the C brand I have been purcharing for years for my son I used this brand growing up</li>
    <li> My husband has struggled with acne for years, and this is the only product that works for him. I&#x27;ve also found it to be effective on the few occasions I&#x27;ve had a break-out. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> You cannot go wrong here. I have used all different products to treat my skin, from a teenage now as an adult. I always will have troubled skin, but at the end of the night, this is the EASIEST product to use to clean your skin. I am very lazy at night, but I somehow find a way to clean my skin quickly with this product.</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin clear. When I feel or see a pimple coming in, I apply one pad then the next day the pimple is fading away. I naturally have nicer skin and have never had an acne problem, but these work really well by keeping my face clean and pimple free!</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for excessive oily skin!  Will be using this product for a long time!!</li>
    <li> It works and fast shipping! Packages are in good condition. It is really nice. I apply it on my face to reduce the number of acne on my face. I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> very good item for the price</li>
    <li> Leaves a Filmy Feeling</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m deployed and this is the only thing out here that helps out my face. I dont get acne much but once in a blue moon I do. This helps out esp for deployment. Doesn&#x27;t dry out around my nose or skin. Not bad for a pack of 3 BIG bottles. thank you for shipping to APO addresses</li>
    <li> I love the Stridex pads.  I have very oily skin and I wear glasses.  That results, without washing my face at least 2-3 times during my work day, in oily skin on my nose and area under my eyes.  This stuff keeps that area much more pleasant for basically the entire day.</li>
    <li> I wash my face in the sink but afterwards I use the pad for makeup or anything i missed. it works great for me and leaves my face clear.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Stridex pads for my 14 year old son. He has the occasional break out and this seems to be an easier solution for him rather than the cleanser and toner that I previously purchased for him&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the pads as well and immediately felt like my face was on fire. The stinging and tingling sensation was very intense so I immediately rinsed my face.  It seems to be effective at cleansing and drying out the active acne with problematic skin.</li>
    <li> Cheap and efficient pads to help clear up acne. Don&#x27;t expect overnight results; these should be used every other day to help prevent future breakouts.</li>
    <li> Bought a three pack of these after dozens of recommendations. They made me break out like crazy, even after two weeks of use. I don&#x27;t recommend these at all, but if you want to try them, please don&#x27;t buy a three pack first. Horrible decision, I should have known better.</li>
    <li> Stridex pads are great for acne.  I use them every evening to clean all the oil and dirt off my face from the day.  They do a great job cleaning and put the salicylic acid acne medication on your skin.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin that is prone to irritation. I used these pads once (sometimes twice) a day for maybe 3 days before my skin starting flaking. I continued to use it ignoring my symptoms because of the rave reviews on amazon. Eventually the dryness and irritation became so bad I had to stop using the product. This product caused me to develop perioral dermatitis around my eye which is still healing. Also when I applied it the skin felt very tight and I could feel the layer of product on my skin. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I am 39 and have struggled with acne since I was about 14, and blackheads since I was 10. I tried everything I could think of that I could afford. I tried facials with extractions,  Biore pore strips,  steaming, charcoal scrubs, clay masks, squeezing, comedone extractors, you name it! I saw a dermatologist for years and even took Accutane twice!  I have never been blackhead free. That was until I tried these. They worked on literally the first use. Now that the blackheads are gone my pores look much smaller too.</li>
    <li> I take these with me when I travel and they do a great job of cleaning my face when I am in a hurry.</li>
    <li> I used the product in the past, stopped for about 4 years and just picked up some more.  Now I use it on and off.  I was using it daily, and it really dries out the skin, but it did not do anything to help with the acne.  I found that the less I used it (now once a week) the better it worked.</li>
    <li> This has a nice smell and seems to be pretty gentle on the skin, but it doesn&#x27;t work wonders for me. I think Oxy works better for my skin!</li>
    <li> I have to say that I though that placing the order from Spain would be more dificult, but the truth is that everything worked out perfect. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Item worked well and arrived as described and on time. I also like to have the choice to buy in bulk.</li>
    <li> Forget makeup removal tissues!  I have used these for years.  They do exactly the job and do not make my face peel.</li>
    <li> I read that salicylic acid was good for keratosis pilaris, the bumpy skin on the backs of upper arms. It works. I had originally purchased this for my teen daughter, but it works for moms, too!</li>
    <li> I can always rely on Stridex</li>
    <li> Stridex is my favorite. For someone who&#x27;s skin is ultra acne prone, this stuff works miracles. It cleanses and NEVER breaks me out. I tried the Oxy stuff and was so horribly disappointed that I kicked myself for having tried anything different. That stuff made my skin SUPER dry and irritated, which resulted in more oil production and left me with greasy, unflattering skin. Stridex does not dry out my skin. I will never use anything else!</li>
    <li> This product has been an absolute lifesaver for me. My skin has been been prone to breakouts either from hormones or from stress for years and no other product has worked like these stridex pads. I have even used prescription medications and ointments from the dermatologist, but nothing has kept my skin clear. After a week of using these pads twice a day along with a moisturiser, my skin was completely cleared up. Future breakouts have been prevented too! I would recommend this product to anyone, as long as you follow up with some type of lotion because the pads could dry out your skin.</li>
    <li> I use the Stridex pads at least twice-daily to clean my face.  My face does not dry out as a result and my occasional acne is under control when I use the Stridex acne pads. :)</li>
    <li> Keeps me clean and clear. Easy to use. I keep it in my desk at work so I can pull it out and use whenever I feel dirty or oily.</li>
