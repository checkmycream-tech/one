      <li>I&#x27;ve been on the search for a good moisturizer</li>
      <li>What I did not expect, and I will blame myself for not noting the 3.5 oz, is that I anticipated a &#x27;good deal&#x27; when I purchased this product at the lower price as I thought it was the 9.5 oz container.</li>

      <li>Perfect for my sensitive face.</li>

      <li>And works wonders very quickly!</li>
      <li>I love love love it!</li>
      <li>A lot of great moisturizer in a fairly sized bottle - much larger and much more immediate results than neutrogena!</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for so many years cannot count, great product and reasonable price!  </li>
      <li>A very good old standby face cream.</li>
      <li>I wish it had a better fragrance</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sticking my fingers into this jar - not the most hygenic.  </li>
      <li>It would be better in a tube or pump.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;1smileycat :-)</li>
      <li>and it makes my face look so much better.</li>
      <li>love Ponds</li>
      <li>and this has a great price and very dependable results.</li>
      <li>Ponds has been in existence for many many years.</li>
      <li>Better than all department store moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m still close to the top.</li>
      <li>I love this cream.</li>
      <li>and now my skin is so smooth and silky!</li>
      <li>Love Pond&#x27;s, loove Amazon.  </li>
      <li>nothing more to say, just love</li>
      <li>one more word for review.</li>
      <li>I love when people ask me what moisturizer I use</li>
      <li>An inexpensive product, it more than does the job.</li>
      <li>and it was gone like magic.</li>
      <li>I would recommend to buy it at stores like Walmart, Target, Walgreens, Rite Aid and more.</li>
      <li>It provides good moisturization and does not cause breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;Better than some higher priced products.</li>
      <li>It does a pretty good job</li>
      <li>This is a very good moisturizer that I would only recommend using at night because it can be greasy as others have mentioned.</li>
      <li>I love the way my skin feels when I smooth on Pond&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>this is good, a bit oily because I like my sky to feel smooth, but this is just my first day using it</li>
      <li>Was very happy,  products came just as I expected, well packaged, and not riped or broke.</li>
      <li>I use it at night and it leaves my sensitive skin feeling very nice and well moisturized.</li>
      <li>As time progresses I am sure that my skin will look more and more hydrated with consistent use.</li>
      <li>and my skin dries out easily in the winter wind...</li>
      <li>I have skin on my nose and forehead that flakes easily, even though it gets blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Really Nice, Buy for my younger sister and she recommended to buy this with having good quality and experience.</li>
      <li>at first, the smell was off putting, but now i kind of like it.</li>
      <li>Product is fine, I guess.</li>
      <li>I love the smell, it goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>They need to make one fragrance free</li>
      <li>This product may be great for a lot of people but it just hasnt worked enough for me.</li>
      <li>I like the feel of it and how smoothly it goes on.</li>
      <li>This is a great product especially for the price.</li>
      <li>Good old Pond&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Those creams advertise sea algae and many other great ingredients.  </li>
      <li>Cetaphil leaves my face feeling fresh, moisturized and never greasy!</li>
      <li>No need to spend more money on higher end brands of face lotions and creams.</li>
      <li>Great for dry skin in the winter.</li>
      <li>It leave my face feeling clean and hydrated.</li>
      <li>However, this worked great on her dry skin.</li>
      <li>NOW if you have normally flakey dry skin this would be awesome for you.</li>
      <li>Nothing special about it</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t need to spend too much money buy more</li>
      <li>Maybe it just doesnt soak in good enough?</li>
      <li>but i love it so much</li>
      <li>I tried many products, including Clinique&#x27;s Moisture Surge Intense Skin Fortifying Hydrator.</li>
      <li>super hydrating</li>
      <li>It leaves your skin so soft, so smooth, hydrated and healthy.</li>
      <li>The reason I continued to use it is because after the first use itself my skin looked so rejuvenated and smooth.</li>
      <li>I have always had pretty clear, dry skin so this moisturizer is perfect for me!</li>
      <li>Definitely my new favorite; would buy again.</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY recommend!!!</li>
      <li>It works better after washing my face because i have tried just putting it on when i dont have time to wash my face and it is less effective at moisterizing.</li>
      <li>i use it everyday, and am happy to find it on amazon because i go through gallons of it on my face, arms and legs.</li>
      <li>this is so soothing and its worth the money</li>
      <li>so I literally apply a finger tip&#x27;s worth of this</li>
      <li>Until then, I will just have to find a more natural moisturizer...</li>
      <li>It goes on clean, is very soft, creamy, rich and emollient, doesn&#x27;t leave my face with a filmy, waxy feel like some products do.</li>
      <li>This is super effective in moisturizing dry spots.</li>
      <li>but my fave still feels kind of dry.</li>
      <li>i live in a very dry climate and my skin always feels better with this very rich moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>It tends to be a little on the oily side for my skin but otherwise good.</li>
      <li>I have tried different creams that advertised more benefits</li>
      <li>a pleasing and recognizable scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this and will definitely buy it again when im out.</li>
      <li>I been known to spend 100 of dollars on facial cream and this stuff is better than those.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery!  </li>
      <li>My skin (late 50&#x27;s) looks great</li>
      <li>and use this cream consistently, your skin will reward you, I promise.</li>
      <li>favorite facial cream ive ever owned.</li>
      <li>This leaves my face feeling soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>However it does keep skin hydrated pretty well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other lotions that claimed to be amazing (I&#x27;m looking at you</li>
      <li>no, but i have used and liked other ponds products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with this product and will continue to be as long as they change nothing in the formula - it&#x27;s perfection.</li>
      <li>I am so glad i found it for my dry skin.</li>
      <li>I think this factor can be contributed to the oils in the formula, but I am not for certain.</li>
      <li>The product still passes with a very high grade.  </li>
      <li>best used during the winter as it is a little heavy for summer.</li>
      <li>Scent is alittle much and may not work for alot of people with allergies to fragrance.</li>
      <li>I really like this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>It does not take much at all to cover a lot of area.</li>
      <li>Reasonably priced skin cream that can go on under makeup for daywear and apply liberally at night.  </li>
      <li>This is light weight on my face but instantly smoothes my skin.</li>
      <li>But putting it on before bed tends to leave my face oily in the morning...which i dont like really.</li>
      <li>I used this for awhile and have noticed that it always makes my skin really oily after using it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Since it&#x27;s so inexpensive and feels light, I plan to continue using and buying this product as a part of my daily skin care routine.</li>
      <li>Not too much for summer, though, either.</li>
      <li>It made my skin really oily.  </li>
      <li>really worked in moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I have reordered this product because I do very well with it.  </li>
      <li>Very disapointing.</li>
      <li>perfect for cold winter months when our skin tends to get its driest.</li>
      <li>This one is very greasy and leaves a shine on your skin.</li>
      <li>When you have a good thing don&#x27;t let it go for the Johnny&#x27;s come lately</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s creamy and smells good and not too thick.</li>
      <li>The price is good compared to other facial moisturizers.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this for years and it does softens skin in an extra rich texture that has</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s totally non pore-clogging, and my skin improved in texture and moisture retention right from the first jar.</li>
      <li>Honestly, this product did very little to help my skin.</li>
      <li>I usually buy it at Walmart because I can get the enormous jar for a pretty good price.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>it keeps my skin soft and wet for the dry weather dastardly delivery and decent price with good quality</li>
      <li>/&gt;Since I am allergic to lanolin and have had sensitive skin my whole life</li>
      <li>Nonetheless, I swim a lot so chlorine really dries my skin out and this product seems to keep it in check thus far.</li>
      <li>But i have normal to combination skin</li>
      <li>I love Pond&#x27;s Dry Skin Cream Facial Moisturizer.</li>
      <li>So I like to use the Ponds dry skin cream, most especially in winter.</li>
      <li>Makes my skin completely smooth and soft, I definitely notice a large different within a week of using it.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>And they usually cost a lot more.  </li>
      <li>I first checked the ingredients on the back of the jar and found this is not listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>In recent years I&#x27;ve become aware of the harmful effects of Paraben preservatives, so for now I&#x27;ve been boycotting Ponds in the hopes that they will take them out.</li>
      <li>I first heard of it when I met a co-worker&#x27;s mom and later mentioned to the co-worker how young her mom looked.  </li>
      <li>It is quite oily and for the winter it is really good and for very dry face, but otherwise i would not buy this or at  least not in bulk.</li>
      <li>I bought this to replace the cetaphil moisturizer I was using and I am pleasantly surprised.  </li>
      <li>wow  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin so soft.</li>
      <li>I took off one star because of the old lady smell it has.</li>
      <li>The ingredients really are not of the quality I would use as a facial moisturizer</li>
      <li>You only need a little&lt;br /&gt;bit, I put it on and my face stays moisturized all day without my skin soaking it up and drying right back out.</li>
      <li>It sure does moisturize and a little goes a long way on my face.</li>
      <li>if I scratch my face in certain areas, like around my nose, skin flakes off, it&#x27;s so dry.</li>
      <li>This would especially be good for winter months when it&#x27;s cold and windy because it&#x27;s a little heavier.  </li>
      <li>I have used many face cr&amp;egrave;mes in my long past and nothing surpasses this product.  </li>
      <li>It might be a tiny bit too much for daily use on my combination/oily skin though.</li>
      <li>Since I use no other products on my hands, I think it must be the Ponds.</li>
      <li>I have noticed a big difference in how my face looks since I first started using Pond&#x27;s Dry Skin Cream.</li>
      <li>But using the wet washcloth step cuts down on the tacky feel and strong smell.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels soft and moisturized immediately and the next morning.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks, but so far, it&#x27;s working well.</li>
      <li>one of the only moisturizer that does not break my sensitive face out.</li>
      <li>Recommended highly for dry skin.</li>
      <li>I live at an elevation of 7000+ and this is the only facial lotion I use.</li>
      <li>I will continue to buy  this and would recommend it to anyone with severe dry skin looking for a low price moisturizers that has a high end result!</li>
      <li>Works real well for my son, whose face gets very dry in the winter - will use this again next winter</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s rich in texture but not too thick.</li>
      <li>Other people will say its greasy, but if your skin is truly dry like mine, It&#x27;ll soak it right up and stay moisturized</li>
      <li>The scent reminds me of something my grandma would wear, but this can be soothing as well because it is a very toned down smell.</li>
      <li>Used it twice so far and haven&#x27;t noticed any clogged pores, but have noticed that my skin doesn&#x27;t look nearly as dry.</li>
      <li>I have naturally oily skin, but as I age, even with the oils my face feels dry.</li>
      <li>I have very dry sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I used Ponds Dry Skin Cream in my teens after finding out that Pro Active made my skin super dry, to the point of scales of dry skin.</li>

<li> Scent is alittle much and may not work for alot of people with allergies to fragrance.</li>
<li> I really like this moisturizer.</li>
<li> It does not take much at all to cover a lot of area.</li>
<li> Reasonably priced skin cream that can go on under makeup for daywear and apply liberally at night.  </li>
<li> This is light weight on my face but instantly smoothes my skin.</li>
<li> But putting it on before bed tends to leave my face oily in the morning...which i dont like really.</li>
<li> I used this for awhile and have noticed that it always makes my skin really oily after using it.</li>
<li> /&gt;Since it&#x27;s so inexpensive and feels light, I plan to continue using and buying this product as a part of my daily skin care routine.</li>
<li> Not too much for summer, though, either.</li>
<li> It made my skin really oily.  </li>
<li> really worked in moisturizing.</li>
<li> I have reordered this product because I do very well with it.  </li>
<li> Very disapointing.</li>
<li> perfect for cold winter months when our skin tends to get its driest.</li>
<li> This one is very greasy and leaves a shine on your skin.</li>
<li> When you have a good thing don&#x27;t let it go for the Johnny&#x27;s come lately</li>
<li> It&#x27;s creamy and smells good and not too thick.</li>
<li> The price is good compared to other facial moisturizers.  </li>
<li> I have been using this for years and it does softens skin in an extra rich texture that has</li>
<li> It&#x27;s totally non pore-clogging, and my skin improved in texture and moisture retention right from the first jar.</li>
<li> Honestly, this product did very little to help my skin.</li>
<li> I usually buy it at Walmart because I can get the enormous jar for a pretty good price.</li>
<li> I highly recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I would highly recommend.</li>
<li> I highly recommend this.</li>
<li> it keeps my skin soft and wet for the dry weather dastardly delivery and decent price with good quality</li>
<li> /&gt;Since I am allergic to lanolin and have had sensitive skin my whole life</li>
<li> Nonetheless, I swim a lot so chlorine really dries my skin out and this product seems to keep it in check thus far.</li>
<li> But i have normal to combination skin</li>
<li> I love Pond&#x27;s Dry Skin Cream Facial Moisturizer.</li>
<li> So I like to use the Ponds dry skin cream, most especially in winter.</li>
<li> Makes my skin completely smooth and soft, I definitely notice a large different within a week of using it.</li>
<li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
<li> And they usually cost a lot more.  </li>
<li> I first checked the ingredients on the back of the jar and found this is not listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> In recent years I&#x27;ve become aware of the harmful effects of Paraben preservatives, so for now I&#x27;ve been boycotting Ponds in the hopes that they will take them out.</li>
<li> I first heard of it when I met a co-worker&#x27;s mom and later mentioned to the co-worker how young her mom looked.  </li>
<li> It is quite oily and for the winter it is really good and for very dry face, but otherwise i would not buy this or at  least not in bulk.</li>
<li> I bought this to replace the cetaphil moisturizer I was using and I am pleasantly surprised.  </li>
<li> wow  </li>
<li> I have sensitive skin</li>
<li> Leaves my skin so soft.</li>
<li> I took off one star because of the old lady smell it has.</li>
<li> The ingredients really are not of the quality I would use as a facial moisturizer</li>
<li> You only need a little&lt;br /&gt;bit, I put it on and my face stays moisturized all day without my skin soaking it up and drying right back out.</li>
<li> It sure does moisturize and a little goes a long way on my face.</li>
<li> if I scratch my face in certain areas, like around my nose, skin flakes off, it&#x27;s so dry.</li>
<li> This would especially be good for winter months when it&#x27;s cold and windy because it&#x27;s a little heavier.  </li>
<li> I have used many face cr&amp;egrave;mes in my long past and nothing surpasses this product.  </li>
<li> It might be a tiny bit too much for daily use on my combination/oily skin though.</li>
<li> Since I use no other products on my hands, I think it must be the Ponds.</li>
<li> I have noticed a big difference in how my face looks since I first started using Pond&#x27;s Dry Skin Cream.</li>
<li> But using the wet washcloth step cuts down on the tacky feel and strong smell.  </li>
<li> My skin feels soft and moisturized immediately and the next morning.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks, but so far, it&#x27;s working well.</li>
<li> one of the only moisturizer that does not break my sensitive face out.</li>
<li> Recommended highly for dry skin.</li>
<li> I live at an elevation of 7000+ and this is the only facial lotion I use.</li>
<li> I will continue to buy  this and would recommend it to anyone with severe dry skin looking for a low price moisturizers that has a high end result!</li>
<li> Works real well for my son, whose face gets very dry in the winter - will use this again next winter</li>
<li> It&#x27;s rich in texture but not too thick.</li>
<li> Other people will say its greasy, but if your skin is truly dry like mine, It&#x27;ll soak it right up and stay moisturized</li>
<li> The scent reminds me of something my grandma would wear, but this can be soothing as well because it is a very toned down smell.</li>
<li> Used it twice so far and haven&#x27;t noticed any clogged pores, but have noticed that my skin doesn&#x27;t look nearly as dry.</li>
<li> I have naturally oily skin, but as I age, even with the oils my face feels dry.</li>
<li> I have very dry sensitive skin</li>
<li> I used Ponds Dry Skin Cream in my teens after finding out that Pro Active made my skin super dry, to the point of scales of dry skin.</li>
<li> a couple years ago I felt like I needed a little more moisturizer at bedtime, so I started using a small amount of aura cacia macadamia oil before applying the ponds dry skin cream.</li>
<li> I have never seen this tiny jar of Pond&#x27;s Dry Skin Cream Facial Moisturizer</li>
<li> I thought switching from Ponds to Aveda, Bare Escentuls, Clinique or other similar brands would help.  </li>
<li> This 3.9 oz little jar goes really far, I&#x27;ve had it for months and still have plenty left.</li>
<li> I tend to have really dry skin, especially after washing my face.</li>
<li> mom told me about it because she used it when she was younger; i have relatively dry skin</li>
<li> This is definitely a family staple for all dry skin tones.</li>
<li> I bought Pond&#x27;s dry skin cream facial moisturizer as a nightly moisturizer before I go to bed.</li>
<li> I recommend getting the regular one of you don&#x27;t have dry skin cause</li>
<li> I have dry skin overall, and this seemed to overcompensate it.</li>
<li> But it&#x27;s definitely only for dry skin.</li>
<li> It was still left feeling dry and flaky.</li>
<li> I have so far less wrinkles compare to friends my age</li>
<li> After initially using this product my face also experience breakout which I usually don&#x27;t get with new products.</li>
<li> A jar lasts me a long time</li>
<li> Quite greasy and takes a long time to absorb in.  </li>
<li> its thick, so don&#x27;t apply too much</li>
<li> It did not dry out anything for me or react, which was a surprise, because most moisturizers in the past have given me a rash or done something weird.</li>
<li> I have used ponds cleanser and dry skin cream for as long as I can remember, I would never use anything else.</li>
<li> A little bit of this stuff goes a long way, doesn&#x27;t clog pores and actually is soothing for extra dry areas.</li>
<li> Long time lover of Ponds face cream!</li>
<li> Although this item was smaller than I expected, still a fan!</li>
<li> I have been using this dry skin cream on my face at night for 20+ years.  </li>
<li> She told me her mom had always used Pond&#x27;s Dry Skin cream.  </li>
<li> I had dry skin</li>
<li> I have severe dry skin that is acne prone.</li>
<li> (because blemishes need to dry out to die)</li>
<li> I have quite dry skin</li>
<li> After washing my face, it tends to peel and get dry</li>
<li> My skin was so freaking dry</li>
<li> I have, in fact, given away $70 jars of face cream, because they just don&#x27;t come close to Pond&#x27;s Dry Skin Cream.</li>
<li> I have extremely dry skin...</li>
<li> i bout the big size and have been using it every night for TWO YEARS and still haven&#x27;t got though HALF OF IT</li>
<li> I also use it on my elbow&#x27;s since they are dry as well.&lt;br /&gt;Not dry anymore!!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve got very dry skin &amp; issues with pinkinsh/redness.  </li>
<li> I started to get very dry skin on my face about a year ago.</li>
<li> and my face feels tight the next morning.  </li>
<li> I bought this for a friend of mine because she has very dry skin and has to be careful what she uses as some products cause her irritation.</li>
<li> Other overnight creams will say they work for dry skin</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried other products but for some reason give me a rash on my neck, but this Ponds dry skin takes the wrinkles away</li>
<li> I have absolutely no wrinkles.</li>
<li> Now my nails are really stronger and haven&#x27;t broken in a longer time.</li>
<li> The oily wet feeling after applying stays on for quite a while.</li>
<li> I notice that on this website it says to wipe with a wet washcloth after applying.  </li>
<li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
<li> I have sensitive, dry skin and this hydrates without irritating.</li>
<li> I only need to use a small amount of Pond&#x27;s on my face and neck.  </li>
<li> Kinda hesitant to use on my entire face because usually I tend to target products with &amp;#34;oil free&amp;#34; as this is recommended for acne prone skin.</li>
<li> This product made my face extremely greasy, I felt like I was applying a coat of oil every night.</li>
<li> Be very careful when buying this product</li>
<li> have extremely dry skin, and this works wonders, even in harsh Michigan winters.</li>
<li> My only complaint is that is has always come in a jar</li>
<li> Lush) and have either broken out of the ingredients</li>
<li> Unfortunately it doesnt completely help with my dry skin.</li>
<li> not gonna lie, i def bought this because i was on a budget, it was less than $4 and had a lot of product in it</li>
<li> Not like previous ponds products used before.</li>
<li> Sometimes if i use it day and night after a few days then the dryness is less</li>
<li> and I get little to no breakouts and</li>
<li> I was a little amused, when i thought of ponds i thought of the stuff my grandma used.</li>
<li> It feels a little greasy.  </li>
<li> It came with no basic little box not even a thin protection layer.</li>
<li> There have been a few times</li>
<li> i feel like when im breaking out it only makes the blemishes worse.</li>
<li> have dried my skin out</li>
<li> this small jar has lasted me through half a winter</li>
<li> got this small one for my sister, she loves Ponds products.</li>
<li> ill probably only use it under my makeup</li>
<li> But I was in a desert for a vacation and came back with peeling skin on the sides of my nose and used expensive creams to no avail.</li>
<li> I slather lots of this on my face for moisture, until it leaves my face shining, usually at night after a bath.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s hard to find a moisturizer that keeps my skin nourished without feeling greasy.</li>
<li> It isnt thick and doesnt feel sticky like some lotions do.</li>
<li> other expensive creams (e.g. Shiseido, Clairns, Clinique, etc.)</li>
<li> It&#x27;s Ponds, I mean you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
<li> so i think i just got the wrong product for my skin type.</li>
<li> All in all for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
<li> But, Ill stick to my inexpensive ponds which doesn&#x27;t hold a stick to any of those creams</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve always taken care of my face but failed to do anything with my neck</li>
<li> When that failed to help, one of the girls at the clinique counter suggested i try Ponds.</li>
<li> Oh my goodness was i wrong!</li>
<li> Turning 30 is boring and hard.</li>
<li> I have tried very expensive face creme products from all over</li>
<li> I was really disappointed by this product</li>
<li> Plus, I&#x27;m still experiencing flakes underneath my foundation.  :(</li>
<li> They&#x27;re usually shocked!</li>

    <li> I live at an elevation of 7000+ and this is the only facial lotion I use. Keeps my skin dewy and doesn&#x27;t cause me to breakout. Double duty!!</li>
    <li> Great for dry skin in the winter. This 3.9 oz little jar goes really far, I&#x27;ve had it for months and still have plenty left. A little bit of this stuff goes a long way, doesn&#x27;t clog pores and actually is soothing for extra dry areas.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace the cetaphil moisturizer I was using and I am pleasantly surprised.  I wish it had a better fragrance but it gives my skin the moisture it needs.</li>
    <li> I like it it keeps my skin soft and wet for the dry weather dastardly delivery and decent price with good quality</li>
    <li> this is so soothing and its worth the money and I also use it for my feet at night /its super hydrating</li>
    <li> Good price excellent quality also worked well at winter time. Don&#x27;t need to spend too much money buy more I will</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s creamy and smells good and not too thick. I use it not only on my face but also on my body after I shower. I</li>
    <li> I have used ponds cleanser and dry skin cream for as long as I can remember, I would never use anything else. a couple years ago I felt like I needed a little more moisturizer at bedtime, so I started using a small amount of aura cacia macadamia oil before applying the ponds dry skin cream. It is wonderful! I have absolutely no wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Stephanie</li>
    <li> Perfect. May be cheaper elsewhere, however.</li>
    <li> I have been using this dry skin cream on my face at night for 20+ years.  I first heard of it when I met a co-worker&#x27;s mom and later mentioned to the co-worker how young her mom looked.  She told me her mom had always used Pond&#x27;s Dry Skin cream.  I had dry skin so I thought I would try it and I have used it ever since.  There have been a few times I have tried different creams that advertised more benefits but I always come back to this one.  Other overnight creams will say they work for dry skin but they just don&#x27;t have the moisturizing effect that Pond&#x27;s does and my face feels tight the next morning.  And they usually cost a lot more.  I only need to use a small amount of Pond&#x27;s on my face and neck.  The cream disappears on my skin so I don&#x27;t look like I have cream all over my face. It has a light pleasant scent.  My skin feels soft and moisturized immediately and the next morning.  My only complaint is that is has always come in a jar so you have to stick your fingers into it.  A jar lasts me a long time so that&#x27;s a lot of nights I&#x27;m sticking my fingers into this jar - not the most hygenic.  It would be better in a tube or pump.  This doesn&#x27;t contain any sunscreen so I don&#x27;t use it during the day.</li>
    <li> Great hydration without the breakouts. Scent is alittle much and may not work for alot of people with allergies to fragrance. They need to make one fragrance free then I would rate it a 5 star.</li>
    <li> Good old Pond&#x27;s. Still a good moisture cream.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer. It is quite oily and for the winter it is really good and for very dry face, but otherwise i would not buy this or at  least not in bulk.</li>
    <li> I use this after I wash my face and before I put on makeup.  I use it morning &amp; night in the winter, and at night in the summer, on my face and neck.  It does not take much at all to cover a lot of area. One container lasts me forever!  My brother even uses this in the winter when his skin gets so dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t clog my acne-prone pores at all! And works wonders very quickly! (I like to think it also helps me avoid wrinkles!- I haven&#x27;t gotten any yet!) This moisturizes without that greasy feeling some products can leave you with.  I highly recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1smileycat :-)</li>
    <li> I started using this product about a year ago. I wanted a simple moisturizer to use at night. My aunt used Ponds for years and has beautiful skin so I bought a jar. I love the smell, it goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly. But I started rubbing the extra cream on my hands and nails. Now my nails are really stronger and haven&#x27;t broken in a longer time. Since I use no other products on my hands, I think it must be the Ponds. &lt;br /&gt;Great product!!</li>
    <li> Does help moisturize facial skin.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin completely smooth and soft, I definitely notice a large different within a week of using it. Could not be happier! A lot of great moisturizer in a fairly sized bottle - much larger and much more immediate results than neutrogena!</li>
    <li> Reasonably priced skin cream that can go on under makeup for daywear and apply liberally at night.  I have been using this for years and it does softens skin in an extra rich texture that has a pleasing and recognizable scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I am allergic to lanolin and have had sensitive skin my whole life I first checked the ingredients on the back of the jar and found this is not listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also no sticky feeling left on your hands or face after applying and no tightness present on the face. It feels so silky when applied after I have come inside from a hot day, relief in a small jar that can be applied over face and throat. I have noticed a big difference in how my face looks since I first started using Pond&#x27;s Dry Skin Cream.</li>
    <li> i live in a very dry climate and my skin always feels better with this very rich moisturizer.  i use it everyday, and am happy to find it on amazon because i go through gallons of it on my face, arms and legs.</li>
    <li> I bought mine from Walmart but I&#x27;m 100% in love with this amazing moisturizer. I have severe dry skin that is acne prone. I&#x27;ve been on the search for a good moisturizer and I finally found it  A lot of moisturizers break me out or do not work on my dryness. This is light weight on my face but instantly smoothes my skin. I wear it under my make up with Maybelline BB cream for acne skin and it makes my face look so much better. I will continue to buy  this and would recommend it to anyone with severe dry skin looking for a low price moisturizers that has a high end result!</li>
    <li> This feels wonderful and causes my skin to look wonderful. A little bit goes a long way. Perfect for my sensitive face.</li>
    <li> not gonna lie, i def bought this because i was on a budget, it was less than $4 and had a lot of product in it so i said why not? This product may be great for a lot of people but it just hasnt worked enough for me. It sure does moisturize and a little goes a long way on my face. But putting it on before bed tends to leave my face oily in the morning...which i dont like really. The oily wet feeling after applying stays on for quite a while. Maybe it just doesnt soak in good enough? i feel like when im breaking out it only makes the blemishes worse. (because blemishes need to dry out to die) NOW if you have normally flakey dry skin this would be awesome for you. and you dont even have to use it on your face you can use it anywhere. But i have normal to combination skin so i think i just got the wrong product for my skin type. regardless i am going to use it up! would i repurchase? no, but i have used and liked other ponds products.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for so many years cannot count, great product and reasonable price!  thank you Ponds!</li>
    <li> Nothing special about it</li>
    <li> i like this cream. It tends to be a little on the oily side for my skin but otherwise good.</li>
    <li> Long time lover of Ponds face cream! Although this item was smaller than I expected, still a fan!</li>
    <li> I tend to have really dry skin, especially after washing my face. I used this for awhile and have noticed that it always makes my skin really oily after using it.</li>
    <li> I discovered this Ponds facial moisturizer about 8 years ago and I&#x27;ve been using it every day since then. I use it twice a day after washing my face and before applying makeup. It leave my face feeling clean and hydrated.</li>
    <li> got this small one for my sister, she loves Ponds products. wow  i can&#x27;t wait for my next order. love Ponds</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 10 years now and I really love it! I usually buy it at Walmart because I can get the enormous jar for a pretty good price. I have always had pretty clear, dry skin so this moisturizer is perfect for me!</li>
    <li> mom told me about it because she used it when she was younger; i have relatively dry skin and my skin dries out easily in the winter wind...this small jar has lasted me through half a winter and i&#x27;m still using it 3 months later</li>
    <li> I have used many face cr&amp;egrave;mes in my long past and nothing surpasses this product.  I have tried very expensive face creme products from all over and this has a great price and very dependable results.</li>
    <li> i bout the big size and have been using it every night for TWO YEARS and still haven&#x27;t got though HALF OF IT but i love it so much and i recommend it</li>
    <li> Ponds has been in existence for many many years. The product still passes with a very high grade.  I love the way my skin feels when I smooth on Pond&#x27;s.  I hope they never change or go out of business.  This is definitely a family staple for all dry skin tones.</li>
    <li> This is a very good moisturizer that I would only recommend using at night because it can be greasy as others have mentioned. I think this factor can be contributed to the oils in the formula, but I am not for certain. Kinda hesitant to use on my entire face because usually I tend to target products with &amp;#34;oil free&amp;#34; as this is recommended for acne prone skin. Nonetheless, I swim a lot so chlorine really dries my skin out and this product seems to keep it in check thus far. Used it twice so far and haven&#x27;t noticed any clogged pores, but have noticed that my skin doesn&#x27;t look nearly as dry. As time progresses I am sure that my skin will look more and more hydrated with consistent use. The scent reminds me of something my grandma would wear, but this can be soothing as well because it is a very toned down smell. All in all for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I love Pond&#x27;s Dry Skin Cream Facial Moisturizer. What I did not expect, and I will blame myself for not noting the 3.5 oz, is that I anticipated a &#x27;good deal&#x27; when I purchased this product at the lower price as I thought it was the 9.5 oz container. I have never seen this tiny jar of Pond&#x27;s Dry Skin Cream Facial Moisturizer so I felt rather duped when I opened the box and saw 3 tiny Ponds jars.</li>
    <li> I bought Pond&#x27;s dry skin cream facial moisturizer as a nightly moisturizer before I go to bed. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks, but so far, it&#x27;s working well. Sometimes moisturizers can be greasy or cause pimples, but that hasn&#x27;t happened yet with this product. It has kind of a baby powder scent, which I don&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it&#x27;s so inexpensive and feels light, I plan to continue using and buying this product as a part of my daily skin care routine.</li>
    <li> I used to use this product years ago and should have never switched. I have sensitive skin therefore I am prone to Breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;This cream keeps my skin hydrated. I also use it on my elbow&#x27;s since they are dry as well.&lt;br /&gt;Not dry anymore!!</li>
    <li> after I put it on it left my skin feeling oily...ill probably only use it under my makeup</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got very dry skin &amp; issues with pinkinsh/redness.  I thought switching from Ponds to Aveda, Bare Escentuls, Clinique or other similar brands would help.  With each of them, my skin still flaked as soon as I put any foundation or powder to even my skin-tone.  I tried coconut oil, vitamin E oil but those were too greasy for daily use.  I am back to Ponds &amp; my facial skin flakes are gone..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again but in a larger size!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend of mine because she has very dry skin and has to be careful what she uses as some products cause her irritation. However, this worked great on her dry skin. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite beauty recommendation! Better than all department store moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely dry skin, and this works wonders, even in harsh Michigan winters. Not too much for summer, though, either.</li>
    <li> I have quite dry skin &amp; it takes two &amp;#34;coats&amp;#34; when I use it, but I like the feel of it and how smoothly it goes on.</li>
    <li> I have very dry sensitive skin and it&#x27;s hard to find a moisturizer that keeps my skin nourished without feeling greasy. I love this and will definitely buy it again when im out.</li>
    <li> It came with no basic little box not even a thin protection layer. Be very careful when buying this product</li>
    <li> After washing my face, it tends to peel and get dry so I literally apply a finger tip&#x27;s worth of this and it softens my skin. My bottle has last me about a year now and I&#x27;m still close to the top. I recommend getting the regular one of you don&#x27;t have dry skin cause using this might make it oily</li>
    <li> I love this cream. Leaves my skin so soft. I also use it as body lotion. For me, this stuff is the best thing on the market. Coming from me it means a lot. I been known to spend 100 of dollars on facial cream and this stuff is better than those. When you have a good thing don&#x27;t let it go for the Johnny&#x27;s come lately just b/c they have a fancy name and seem like the very best. Those creams advertise sea algae and many other great ingredients.  But, Ill stick to my inexpensive ponds which doesn&#x27;t hold a stick to any of those creams, Thank you! I HIGHLY recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I was hoping I could use this during the day time, but it makes my face look greasy.  So I end up using it during night time.</li>
    <li> Spouse swears by it&#x27;s effectiveness</li>
    <li> It made my skin really oily.  I have dry skin overall, and this seemed to overcompensate it.</li>
    <li> Works and smells great</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. I use it daily and it definitely makes a difference! It&#x27;s not greasy and I like that it&#x27;s unscented, and it was a great price. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I never taken care of my face as I should so I ordered a jar of this to start the process. Turning 30 is boring and hard. so far this has been a really, really great choice!! I have very sensitive skin and I get little to no breakouts and this lotion has been a perfect balance to keep that consistent. I&#x27;ve tried other lotions that claimed to be amazing (I&#x27;m looking at you Lush) and have either broken out of the ingredients have dried my skin out drastically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again and continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This product made my face extremely greasy, I felt like I was applying a coat of oil every night. After about a week, patches of my face became chapped, red and flakey. It just wasn&#x27;t moisturizing at all. I was really disappointed by this product and I won&#x27;t leaving my brand of choice again! Cetaphil leaves my face feeling fresh, moisturized and never greasy!</li>
    <li> A very good moisturizer for my neck. I&#x27;ve always taken care of my face but failed to do anything with my neck and I started noticing it that I was getting that turkey neck. I&#x27;ve tried other products but for some reason give me a rash on my neck, but this Ponds dry skin takes the wrinkles away and I don&#x27;t get a rash.</li>
    <li> Really Nice, Buy for my younger sister and she recommended to buy this with having good quality and experience.</li>
    <li> My skin was so freaking dry so I ordered this moisturizer and I startrd using it immediately and now my skin is so smooth and silky! I love love love it! I so recommend this!</li>
    <li> Works real well for my son, whose face gets very dry in the winter - will use this again next winter</li>
    <li> still trying to look for a great face moisturizer, hoping this will do the trick!</li>
    <li> Coming from using no facial moisturizer whatsoever this is good, a bit oily because I like my sky to feel smooth, but this is just my first day using it so I will give it two weeks and see.</li>
    <li> Product is fine, I guess. But the seller sent it to me already opened.</li>
    <li> I have skin on my nose and forehead that flakes easily, even though it gets blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really worked in moisturizing. It did not dry out anything for me or react, which was a surprise, because most moisturizers in the past have given me a rash or done something weird.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Amost 80, always used Pond Creams.  Love Pond&#x27;s, loove Amazon.  nothing more to say, just love it.okay?  one more word for review.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery!  Was very happy,  products came just as I expected, well packaged, and not riped or broke. Happy happy customer.!</li>
    <li> I started to get very dry skin on my face about a year ago. I tried many products, including Clinique&#x27;s Moisture Surge Intense Skin Fortifying Hydrator. When that failed to help, one of the girls at the clinique counter suggested i try Ponds. I was a little amused, when i thought of ponds i thought of the stuff my grandma used. Oh my goodness was i wrong! It leaves your skin so soft, so smooth, hydrated and healthy. I am so glad i found it for my dry skin.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin feel good and is softening.  A very good old standby face cream.</li>
    <li> I love when people ask me what moisturizer I use and I tell them it&#x27;s ponds! They&#x27;re usually shocked! An inexpensive product, it more than does the job. I took off one star because of the old lady smell it has. C&#x27;mon ponds, make it unscented rather.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a local drug store.  The price is good compared to other facial moisturizers.  It feels a little greasy.  I notice that on this website it says to wipe with a wet washcloth after applying.  The jar directions don&#x27;t mention that step.  I wish it came in an unscented version.  I don&#x27;t like the perfume smell at all.  But using the wet washcloth step cuts down on the tacky feel and strong smell.  I will use up the jar but probably won&#x27;t buy again.  I have a tube of unscented aloe vera gel that seems to work just as well without the perfume smell.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for almost 25 years, and it&#x27;s THE best!!! Over the years, I&#x27;ve occasionally tried (just for a change) other expensive creams (e.g. Shiseido, Clairns, Clinique, etc.) and within a couple of days, I&#x27;m grateful to go back to Pond&#x27;s. I have, in fact, given away $70 jars of face cream, because they just don&#x27;t come close to Pond&#x27;s Dry Skin Cream. It&#x27;s totally non pore-clogging, and my skin improved in texture and moisture retention right from the first jar. I&#x27;m in love with this product and will continue to be as long as they change nothing in the formula - it&#x27;s perfection. My skin (late 50&#x27;s) looks great and if you take care of yourself diet wise, etc. and use this cream consistently, your skin will reward you, I promise.</li>
    <li> I have reordered this product because I do very well with it.  It provides good moisturization and does not cause breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;Better than some higher priced products.</li>
    <li> this is a nice moisturizer. at first, the smell was off putting, but now i kind of like it. best used during the winter as it is a little heavy for summer.</li>
    <li> This is super effective in moisturizing dry spots. It might be a tiny bit too much for daily use on my combination/oily skin though. But I was in a desert for a vacation and came back with peeling skin on the sides of my nose and used expensive creams to no avail. 2 days with this and it was gone like magic. Recommended highly for dry skin. I just use the excess now on my body and it smells like baby powder. (Depending on how you like that smell)</li>
    <li> I used Ponds Dry Skin Cream in my teens after finding out that Pro Active made my skin super dry, to the point of scales of dry skin. It worked wonders, but with time I could no longer afford the acne treatment, and there went the Ponds too. I just didn&#x27;t need it anymore. In recent years I&#x27;ve become aware of the harmful effects of Paraben preservatives, so for now I&#x27;ve been boycotting Ponds in the hopes that they will take them out. Until then, I will just have to find a more natural moisturizer...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Ponds, I mean you can&#x27;t go wrong. Creamy, cool, great scent. The only thing I will say though is this 3.9 oz is smaller than I thought. In the stores you find the tiny, medium and hug sizes. It&#x27;s the tiny one.</li>
    <li> one of the only moisturizer that does not break my sensitive face out. its thick, so don&#x27;t apply too much</li>
    <li> This works well for the low cost . I have been using it to take of my makeup and use as a body lotion. The ingredients really are not of the quality I would use as a facial moisturizer</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this product. I use it at night and it leaves my sensitive skin feeling very nice and well moisturized.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin...if I scratch my face in certain areas, like around my nose, skin flakes off, it&#x27;s so dry. So of course I&#x27;ve tried every kind of moisturizer out there. This has worked the best for me. You only need a little&lt;br /&gt;bit, I put it on and my face stays moisturized all day without my skin soaking it up and drying right back out. But it&#x27;s definitely only for dry skin. Other people will say its greasy, but if your skin is truly dry like mine, It&#x27;ll soak it right up and stay moisturized and it won&#x27;t look greasy.</li>
    <li> Honestly, this product did very little to help my skin. It was still left feeling dry and flaky. Very disapointing.</li>
    <li> favorite facial cream ive ever owned. perfect for cold winter months when our skin tends to get its driest. also great for the summer so after i tan i have perfectly silky skin.</li>
    <li> Trying it on face but still has perfume added to it so it&#x27;s a no go for me. It didn&#x27;t do anything but make face sticky.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer! I have sensitive, dry skin and this hydrates without irritating. Definitely my new favorite; would buy again.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time! This leaves my face feeling soft and smooth. It isnt thick and doesnt feel sticky like some lotions do. Unfortunately it doesnt completely help with my dry skin. It does a pretty good job but my fave still feels kind of dry. Sometimes if i use it day and night after a few days then the dryness is less but i dont always have the time to wash my face morning and night. It works better after washing my face because i have tried just putting it on when i dont have time to wash my face and it is less effective at moisterizing.</li>
    <li> This is an inexpensive, yet excellent product. I have naturally oily skin, but as I age, even with the oils my face feels dry. So I like to use the Ponds dry skin cream, most especially in winter. It goes on clean, is very soft, creamy, rich and emollient, doesn&#x27;t leave my face with a filmy, waxy feel like some products do. I slather lots of this on my face for moisture, until it leaves my face shining, usually at night after a bath. No need to spend more money on higher end brands of face lotions and creams. Ponds is perfect when you need moisture for your winter skin. Doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts either. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Nice, and smells good.</li>
    <li> Used this for several years... I have so far less wrinkles compare to friends my age</li>
    <li> After initially using this product my face also experience breakout which I usually don&#x27;t get with new products. I just continued to use the product and my skin eventually adjusted to it. The reason I continued to use it is because after the first use itself my skin looked so rejuvenated and smooth. It has a light fragrance that is very pleasant and the consistency is just perfect. It&#x27;s rich in texture but not too thick. This is a great product especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Quite greasy and takes a long time to absorb in.  Plus, I&#x27;m still experiencing flakes underneath my foundation.  :(</li>
    <li> I would recommend to buy it at stores like Walmart, Target, Walgreens, Rite Aid and more. It cost about $4.</li>
    <li> Not like previous ponds products used before. This one is very greasy and leaves a shine on your skin. However it does keep skin hydrated pretty well.</li>
    <li> This would especially be good for winter months when it&#x27;s cold and windy because it&#x27;s a little heavier.  Love the smell of it!</li>
