      <li>I used another product to reline my own dentures which worked great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on two weeks now and its still holding good.</li>
      <li>This means that you rinse your dentures, boom, they&#x27;re good to go.</li>
      <li>a good hair dryer and set it on HOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have used this type of product before and have found it to be a good alternative to the expense of having dentures relined by Dentist.  </li>
      <li>Good price always buy this product on line for my father.</li>
      <li>It works good to use it at night before bed.</li>
      <li>but it is the best fit you can get</li>
      <li>Works good.  </li>
      <li>It seems to work fairly well until you eat or drink.</li>
      <li>During application, if it finds a good edge it will lift polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>this is a good product, it&#x27;s time consumimg and the directions have to be followed exactly&lt;</li>
      <li>Lots of good reviews on this product, didnt work for me at all,</li>
      <li>It is a good product, a cushion, something like a reline but Not an Adhesive.</li>
      <li>it work good but dont know how to use it</li>
      <li>If you have dentures that don&#x27;t fit well, this is the best solution!  </li>
      <li>but this adhesive seems to be good stuff.  </li>
      <li>She was delighted with her purchase through Amazon, since I did all the leg work in finding it she was delighted.</li>
      <li>Just as good as everyone says.</li>
      <li>i dont use it for dentures, i use it tofix hearing aid shells, works good.</li>
      <li>works good got here</li>
      <li>the price was good</li>
      <li>I think this is a good product to use temporary.</li>
      <li>Best product for dentures with no after taste and holds secure.</li>
      <li>I will tell everynody this is a good product.</li>
      <li>It has alot of good ratings, try it for yourself because what doesn&#x27;t work for one may for another.</li>
      <li>This was a good product.</li>
      <li>but it works fairly well.</li>
      <li>No goo, no gaps -- good stuff.</li>
      <li>Exceptional.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product, very good service from supplier.</li>
      <li>My husband is very pleased with our order of cushion grip.</li>
      <li>is very pleased with this product.  </li>
      <li>It was sent as stated and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
      <li>love it came on time and great packaging</li>
      <li>but after i got them just right there perfect!!!</li>
      <li>excellent, best I&#x27;ve ever used to keep my partial in place while eating even crunchy food.</li>
      <li>It took a couple of tries for me to get the perfect amount for the best hold.</li>
      <li>The product is excellent, however, it is very overpriced!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ordering more!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>Love It!</li>
      <li>and I am able to eat things I couldn&#x27;t eat before!</li>
      <li>Ok, do my aunt told me about this product I am amazed at the moment!</li>
      <li>I did not know it could help as much as it does!!!!!</li>
      <li>Amazing product.</li>
      <li>everything i xperienced thru Amazon and delivery to using product has just been amazing.</li>
      <li>I had great expectations of this product because nothing else has worked, I followed the directions as stated and it didn&#x27;t secure my teeth at all not even minutes.</li>
      <li>and you will have a great fit.</li>
      <li>I was using Poligrip powder and was thrilled with it for about 3 days.</li>
      <li>I had ordered Cushion Grip to have on hand just in case, and was thrilled to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product should be used with good fitting dentures and ones that are not roughed up.  </li>
      <li>and I really liked using it&lt;br</li>
      <li>Its good but just  a handful of bucks (at most)  </li>
      <li>Gotta say, it&#x27;s really nice not feeling</li>
      <li>The best thing I&#x27;ve tried &amp; it works really well.</li>
      <li>It is a thermoplastic that once applied sets up and nicely form fits your uppers and lowers.  </li>
      <li>This product really works great!!</li>
      <li>Peel away the warm Cushion Grip from dentures with fingers or a wood manicure stick.</li>
      <li>Nice product</li>
      <li>The thing that most of us want is to keep food out from under the dentures, and to have some good cushioning betweet the gums.</li>
      <li>This has a great taste and it lightly sweet.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t do a great deal to keep my dentures in place, it doesn&#x27;t make them more comfortable, and it&#x27;s aggravating to remove.  </li>
      <li>easy to work with and feels good.  </li>
      <li>quick is great product I will use it again</li>
      <li>Just heat the tube up in hot(not boiling) water, and it is very easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>Now they don&#x27;t sell it any more because the price has more than doubled --overnight!  </li>
      <li>great product and best in the market will recomend to other users.</li>
      <li>Easy to use, and easy directions to follow!!</li>
      <li>I give it a three for the best by far</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for years with great success.</li>
      <li>The best denture cleaner by far on the market is Renew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>he must have liked it because he ordered more, but we never discussed it.  </li>
      <li>This is by far the best adhesive I have tried.  </li>
      <li>May need to trim to fit the area but good choice.</li>
      <li>It is probably an effective product for most people.  </li>
      <li>Amazon.com sent our order very quick and we are very pleased.</li>
      <li>Just the product for a beautiful smile, great fit, easy wearing, feels comfortable in the mouth and easy to manage!</li>
      <li>The Cushion Grip worked great the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>Very Comfortable.</li>
      <li>It makes my dentures very comfortable until I can go and get my permanent reline done.  </li>
      <li>I also just saved you a lot of moneyby posting this free information about dentures and you can post your gratitude for free :o)</li>
      <li>This is a good quick fix.</li>
      <li>Has no unpleasant odor and good staying power.</li>
      <li>waiter approached and said is that a large fly in your soup?</li>
      <li>This is an ok item</li>
      <li>I just want to say I am glad I used Amazon.com for my purchase for denture adhesive.</li>
      <li>I love this item.</li>
      <li>In addition, even after letting it set for thirty minutes or more, when the denture is removed, the cushion grip plastic like substance stays in your mouth; not in the denture.</li>
      <li>It helps better than anything I have found.  </li>
      <li>and the supply of it will no longer be available!</li>
      <li>My mother had needed some more Cushion Grip</li>
      <li>Also, I think someone suggested adding fixodent on top of it</li>
      <li>so it will adhere to your gums better.</li>
      <li>I love powdered adhesives, because you take the dentures outa the soak water.</li>
      <li>and you will be satisfied.  </li>
      <li>it is more like a liner.  </li>
      <li>I feel so confident now</li>
      <li>I work at a church. :-)</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>- just make sure you divide the cushion grip material up and</li>
      <li>It also conforms to where it is needed most.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t use this any more.</li>
      <li>Bubblegum would do a better job, and taste nicer.</li>
      <li>Stores just don&#x27;t seem to carry it any more.  </li>
      <li>We&#x27;re glad to find it online at Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I have tried numerous products the best of which was denturite by sea bond</li>
      <li>I am so glad I found the dental  thermoplastic</li>
      <li>It is a soft, cushiony reline that makes them fit so perfectly that they no longer need to be &#x27;glued&#x27; in place.  </li>
      <li>sticks well and helps line poorly fitting dentures.</li>
      <li>I tried it on my top but it would not keep them in place</li>
      <li>I will keep searching for something more permanant</li>
      <li>I have tried this many times.</li>
      <li>or you wont be satisfied.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I had been fighting poorly fitting dentures--no matter what the dentist did they ate up my gums.  </li>
      <li>intend to try the hair dryer method mentioned in another review to get more use out of one application.</li>
      <li>well thats what uou pay for something that is going to feel better for hours .</li>
      <li>AND I LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>SO GLAD</li>
      <li>Many, many reviews about this product gave it a five star.  </li>
      <li>It would really be nice to have the lower plate stay secure in my mouth for 4 days (as the manufacture</li>
      <li>why can&#x27;t I buy it any more???</li>
      <li>I am so glad that Amazon has it online.</li>
      <li>I will be ordering some more just in case Amazon might run out..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I found it</li>
      <li>I am going to do everything under my power to be sure this company gets what they deserve.</li>
      <li>I was quite pleased .</li>
      <li>Satisfied with results.</li>
      <li>Make sure you read the instructions and use it accordingly.</li>
      <li>I have ordered this many times.</li>
      <li>Im better off with the powder.</li>
      <li>I do better with Fixodent...  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff, it has worked miracles for me.</li>
      <li>I could not wear my top denture without gagging.</li>
      <li>I was told about this by a friend and thought what the heck, and I love it</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for the perfect denture adhesive, look no further.   </li>
      <li>It works better than my expectations.</li>
      <li>the most I could get was three at the most.</li>
      <li>It will make your dentures feel better</li>
      <li>Overall the product works wonderfully.</li>
      <li>and I have not been able to find it anywhere except on the internet.</li>
      <li>It takes a while to get used to fitting it around the inside of the dentures</li>
      <li>but after many trials, opted for another adhesive product.  </li>
      <li>Besides, it costs a lot more than the EFFERGRIP.  </li>
      <li>For some folks, this could be seen as okay because CUSHION GRIP doesn&#x27;t need to be applied every day</li>
      <li>I love this product and I will always use this.</li>
      <li>you read any further about Cushion Grip, I refer you to the excellent tutorial by echoscream.&lt;br /&gt;To</li>
      <li>It makes my dentures for a lot better than they did.</li>
      <li>Be sure and use it sparingly -</li>
      <li>and I feel I had to use more</li>
      <li>putting ok on this for now  arrived on 6th</li>
      <li>She loves it and it works better than we thought it would.</li>
      <li>I love cushion grip.</li>
      <li>just keep it &amp; be  satisfied</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve TRIED many Denture Adhesives, even the pads.</li>
      <li>My Mother had ordered this from a book for many years.</li>
      <li>This works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Did not want to have more denture issues out.  </li>
      <li>Ayway, the stuff was magic.  </li>
      <li>Am sure I will get faster and more efficient doing the cushion gripping.  </li>
      <li>But as I get more and more skilled I expect to rave about it</li>
      <li>it is ok , helpt me many times</li>
      <li>/&gt;I will be buying more Cushion Grip, even after I get my permanent dentures.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
      <li>I am now able to eat without my lower plate giving me a problem.</li>
      <li>My favorite app.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Suddenly, most stores like Walmart and Rite Aid stopped selling it.</li>
      <li>The seller made sure that the product was delivered in a timely fashion, and there was no damage to it.</li>
      <li>We will be ordering again, for sure.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>So glad I ordered this one.</li>
      <li>Could not find in stores so glad to find it on here</li>
      <li>I love it, however...</li>
      <li>the price makes it unaffordable for most people who need to use it,</li>
      <li>Was not any better than anything else I have tried.</li>
      <li>Try it, I&#x27;m sure you will like it.</li>
      <li>Need this for my teeth  think I&#x27;ll order more</li>
      <li>I love cushion grip but you have almost tripled your price.</li>
      <li>I use to be able to get 4 tubes for 20$.....</li>
      <li>and I was very excited.  </li>
      <li>(I love sharing this kind of cool</li>
      <li>Great idea!would highly reccommend.</li>
      <li>so I decided to try it based on how consistent the good reviews were.</li>
      <li>I will teach you have to take full responsibility of your own health</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried corn on the cob yet or apples but everything else has been pretty good.  </li>
      <li>Not as good as when I first started to use it.</li>
      <li>Followed the directions which were easy, although I think I could have allowed more time for the stuff to &amp;</li>
      <li>I love this product, makes wearing dentures so much more comfortable.</li>
      <li>When used properly it will fit perfectly to your gums and palate.</li>
      <li>This is truly the best product I have found for giving my dentures a tight and more secure feeling!</li>
      <li>(the price on Renew is very good also) and found the following to be true:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(1) makes dentures fit like a glove (2) can eat most foods when applied (3)</li>
      <li>and you will be set free to enjoy the best health possible in life.</li>
      <li>As a cheap I&#x27;m out of everything this is ok</li>
      <li>It made my dentures immensely more comfortable</li>
      <li>I was looking for a better grip than the Secure Denture Adhesive.  </li>
      <li>Cost on Cushion Grip is out of this world and would like to find it at a better cheap price, rather than being &#x27;RIPPED OFF&#x27; on eBay!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Although it is not an adhesive in the sense that it sticks to your gum,it does provide a tighter more cushioned fit.</li>
      <li>So far this worked great for me.  </li>
      <li>it made his smile nice and not lopsided</li>
      <li>Worked well making my dentures fit better and more comfortably until I get a realingnment.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products &amp; this one works the best for me...</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>Easy to manipulate in the&lt;br /&gt;form that is needed.</li>
      <li>Not that easy to put on dentures as it is of a plastic consistency and tube must be heated before using it - then must wait awhile for it to somewhat harden and set.</li>
      <li>Removal is also easy (again, follow</li>
      <li>The instructions were easy to follow and apply.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but it does not come off of the denture easily.</li>
      <li>If you follow the instructions it is relatively easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply lasts for me up to 7days and removes easily.</li>
      <li>I found that it is easy to remove then</li>
      <li>I found this to be almost as easy as applying ploy grip.</li>
      <li>I use this all the time and it is easy to reorder it  on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Was fairly easy to apply when I obeyed the instructions.</li>
      <li>even if i had gotten a good seal, the price is too high.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and to remove just run warm or hot water over your denture.</li>
      <li>It feels warm at first  </li>
      <li>Warm the capped tube in hot tap water (not boiling) for 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Just tried again, and seems fine.  </li>
      <li>This may be fine for others..</li>
      <li>But I grinned and beared it (pardon the pun) and all was fine.</li>
      <li>the only thing that would make it better is if you didn&#x27;t have to warm it up to get it out of the tube!</li>
      <li>no bad taste no messy cream great for eating.</li>
      <li>and you will be fine</li>
      <li>NOT because it was wearing out), and not only prevents sore spots from rubbing, but also creates a perfect \\&quot;vacuum\\&quot; seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, as others have mentioned, I do notice a tingling/burning sensation on the first application, but it goes away within minutes.  </li>
      <li>When dentures wear down after awhile this is an one of the best I&#x27;ve found to making the dentures fit like they are suppose to.</li>
      <li>Warm to reasonably heated water as a mouth wash, will allow you to unglue your dentures easily in a couple of minutes, and wash them.</li>
      <li>Warm to reasonably heated water as a mouth wash, will allow you to unglue your dentures easily in a couple of minutes, and wash them.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great for adding a lining to loose fitting dentures.</li>
      <li>Was very easy to clean out of the plate, just peeled right out.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re in a huge hurry, go to CVS.</li>
      <li>After that I use my regular adhesive and dentures fit great.</li>
      <li>This product is no longer available where I live,but Amazon had it and I will order it again when needed.</li>
      <li>This product made a comfortable cushion for my dentures, but it did not adhere well to my gums.  </li>
      <li>&amp; it never worked, I thought  when I bought Cushion Grip it would be A great denture adhesive, so i purchase four big mistake i tryed to get a refund but never did.</li>
      <li>but it does make for a comfortable hold.</li>
      <li>but they saw fit to discontinue.  </li>
      <li>But it is supposed to make a difference in the fit, of your denture, which, to some degree, it does.</li>
      <li>It is extremely comfortable.</li>
      <li>/&gt;For those of us who cannot afford a trip to the dentist for a re-line every time gum erosion causes the fit to change, this product is a life-saver.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic product but WAY</li>
      <li>I will stick to Secure from now on.</li>
      <li>Teeth feel tight&lt;br /&gt;and secure.</li>
      <li>I order me six tubes for only twenty-three dollars and that is great.</li>
      <li>The &#x27;Secure&#x27; denture cream is what holds dentures in place, I think.</li>
      <li>My husband has used this brand to secure his dentures for years...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m cheap</li>
      <li>I soak my dentures nightly and it does not effect the fit or cushion.</li>
      <li>Holds well and is comfortable.</li>
      <li>I stumbled across it accidently for him and found that it did the job great and is not a daily reliner for his denture.  </li>
      <li>It makes them feel secure</li>
      <li>There is a detailed review by &#x27;Robert&#x27;  on the item</li>
      <li>, I guess my lesson learned is you need a SECURE HOLDING DENTURE to use this product.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Anyone who does not want to take the time to fit them-forget them.</li>
      <li>Stay away.e who does not want to take the time to fit them-forget them.</li>
      <li>i only got this product as my neighbor said it was great</li>
      <li>I followed the directions precisely, it burned like heck for over 5 minutes and let go after 22 minutes.  </li>
      <li>My recommendation is don&#x27;t go cheap and go to your dentist for any repairs or re-alignment you have to get done.</li>
      <li>I had met with my oral surgeon about installing 4 implants to secure my lower plate.</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years to help adjust the fit of my dentures.</li>
      <li>there is no room for it to fit between the gums and teeth.</li>
      <li>This product is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>Love the product..........  Not crazy about the price.....</li>
      <li>It was ok but was not to impress was to much to do it might be ok for others but not my cup of tea</li>
      <li>I have found that it continues to &#x27;set&#x27; (gradually becoming more hardened) for the first 24-36 hours.  </li>
      <li>The only product of this type that really works perfectly.</li>
      <li>Look at the drawing that comes in the box, and make sure you surround as if in a circle the Palate part of your denture.&lt;br /&gt;Remember that if the palate is perfectly glued to the dome of your mouth, (sometimes even creating a sucker effect)</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to eat right since I got my dentures 3 years ago</li>
      <li>He was excited to know he can order it through Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Just minutes ago I tried it for the first time, and can I tell you - my denture feels more snug than the day I had it put in.    </li>
      <li>The beauty of this product is that it builds up your dentures so you they feel like they did when you first got them, maybe even better.</li>
      <li>so i tried just sprinkling with an adhesive powder and unbelievably the combination is GREAT!!!</li>
      <li>Cushion Grip is by far the best product on the market for comfortably fitting all dentures, even partial dentures.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am familiar with this product although I question why there was a recall.</li>
      <li>I am never disappointed with my amazon purchases.</li>
      <li>I wish another company would pick this product up and start making it at the original price of under $10.00.</li>
      <li>I followed the directions on the paper insert and was able to wear my lowers all day for the first time since I&#x27;ve had them.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
      <li>I guess somebody has to get rich.</li>
      <li>Did OK the First time I used it ---For 1 day.</li>
      <li>as long as you don&#x27;t plan on eating works great, or a baby food or liquid diet....</li>
      <li>works great, makes my partial comfortable to wear all day</li>
      <li>It is the only denture cream she&#x27;s found that works good and is comfortable.</li>
      <li>You can clean your dentures with whatever method you prefer and the adhesive will still adhere.</li>
      <li>, your gums change all the time - this product gives you a constant good fit</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and it really works when your dentures don&#x27;t fit exactly right.</li>
      <li>For people with loose dentures that can&#x27;t afford the high price of relining, this is the best.</li>
      <li>I however need more time to come to a positive conclusion as to the true value of this item.</li>
      <li>my thanks to echoscream for his/hers very useful tutorial, I wish you luck with Cushion Grip.rawing that comes in the box, and make sure you surround as if in a circle the Palate part of your denture.&lt;br /&gt;Remember that if the palate is perfectly glued to the dome of your mouth, (sometimes even creating a sucker effect)</li>
      <li>it run for one minute which super dries the dentures and significantly heats up</li>
      <li>works great, especially on older dentures that may have worn a bit and become loose.</li>
      <li>Soft thermoplastic denture adhesive is very comfortable and relatively easy to use.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is a problem for most users or if it&#x27;s a rare occurrence, but for the first fifteen minutes or so the adhesive burned my gums and palate.</li>
      <li>MERCK HAS STOPPED MANUFACTURING CUSHION GRIP, WHY, UNKNOWN, BUT NOT AN INTELLIGENT BUSINESS DECISION.  </li>
      <li>DONT USE MY FULL NAME  </li>
      <li>It is such good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I put in warm water till soft, roll it like a worm and sit it in the denture.</li>
      <li>It does need to be used with reg adhesive because Cushion Grip is not an true adhesive, just builds up and fills in dentures.</li>
      <li>I have Full uppers and a lower &amp;#34;bridge.</li>
      <li>You gotta have this stuff if you wear Dr. Bailey&#x27;s Secure Smile teeth.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that I can just pop my dentures in and be ready to go.</li>
      <li>really need more practice</li>
      <li>and it feels like a sift cushoin I love it , the seller was fast delivery</li>
      <li>All I use is some extra hold powder adhesive, and I am good to go.  </li>
      <li>Although CUSHION GRIP is  a good product, it takes second place, in my opinion, to EFFERGRIP.  </li>
      <li>This is a good product, &amp; thank God I only needed it temporarily, as all amazon sellers are price gouging on it because it&#x27;s being discontinued!</li>
      <li>hope this is helpful, if so please check the appropriate box, Thanks.</li>
      <li>No bad taste.</li>
      <li>Great for new and old denture wearers.  </li>
      <li>The detailed descriptions of HOW TO are right on.</li>
      <li>i am really impressed by what this stuff is able to do,it is easy to work with and is miles ahead of anything else iv&#x27;e tried for making loose dentures fit better and more comfortably,anyone who has never tried it and is having trouble with poor fitting dentures don&#x27;t hesitate to give this a shot,its really amazing</li>
      <li>This stuff works great for other things too.</li>
      <li>But as long as I had it in, it felt good and made it more tolerable in eating because it wouldn&#x27;t let as much food up under the lower denture.</li>
      <li>Best product I have ever used,no more loose dentures and most of all no more need for polygrip.</li>
      <li>A new application gives better results on a clean denture surface.</li>
      <li>The more times you apply the material you get better with the application and find you can use less with better results.  </li>
      <li>We looked in many stores but were only able to find it online.  </li>
      <li>This product always arrives quick and is never damaged.  </li>
      <li>Thankfully, I was sitting in the car waiting for a friend who had run in quickly to get something.  </li>
      <li>When he needs more, I&#x27;ll definitely buy more for him.</li>
      <li>Although like I said I used more then recommended since my pallet is sore from the top denture rocking back and forth!</li>
      <li>My product arrived quickly and this weekend, I gave it</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly and holds well.</li>
      <li>I have tried everything to keep my bottom dentures in, i then seen the cushion grip thermoplastic denture adhesive and how it could hold denture for up to 4 days, What a load of rubbish ,you will be lucky if your dentures stay in for 4 hours ,never mind 4 days.&lt;br</li>
      <li>too expensive but is a wonderful product works better than anything else i have tried but too pricey</li>
      <li>AND SO ARE THEIR LOYAL CUSTOMERS.  </li>
      <li>Removing the old adhesive, is very easy.</li>
      <li>Removing the old adhesive, is very easy.</li>
      <li>I thought I was going to finally be able to eat normally again.</li>
      <li>very hot water.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
      <li>After discovering this product I was able to stabilize the wire and wait until my normal visit.  </li>
      <li>She is very pleased with it and now has the address for future needs and order purposed.  </li>
      <li>You would be better getting new dentures or relining.</li>
      <li>may be great for normal actual dentures but</li>
      <li>may be great for normal actual dentures but</li>
      <li>I love this product and will continue to purchase it as long as it is available!</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!!</li>
      <li>I bought it locally, it turns out I paid a couple bucks more!</li>
      <li>I soak my dentures over night every day and have the cleanest, most beautiful dentures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For partial dentures, do the same thing</li>
      <li>My mom needed it for her dentures, she needed a reline and we lived far from that dentist, so this lasted plenty until she could get to the dentist! :)</li>
      <li>When I first bought Cushion Grip Thermoplastic Adhesive, which, by the way, I found at CVS, I was so excited.</li>
      <li>really rip off this used to cost $6.00 a tube !!  </li>
      <li>She said to just soak them in hot water and it comes off!</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it says it does: it *cushions* your gums!</li>
      <li>but if you apply it right, it will last more than a month easily from one application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product is not available everywhere, so I was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Nothing too amazing about cushion grip, simply holds well.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
      <li>Wow, do I love this stuff, or WHAT?</li>
      <li>you want more information or you have questions, you can arrange a time to talk with me one on one as I am a top level health consultant in every area of human health and my rates are reasonable.</li>
      <li>, it would&#x27;ve been worth it.  </li>
      <li>The manufacturer needs to contact my family member for a truly honest,  bona fide commercial.</li>
      <li>This product is definitely worth trying if adhesive alone does not do the job.  </li>
      <li>Degree of success will vary with each person.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Regardless of removal issues, Cushion Grip is worth its weight in gold.</li>
      <li>Worth the hassle and will be reordering soon.</li>
      <li>keeping this handy to put it back in position no one knew.</li>
      <li>Attach enclosed slotted key to end of warm Cushion Grip tube.</li>
      <li>This stuff is not at all what I expected after reading all the good reviews before purchase.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth the money</li>
      <li>Dip your dentures in warm water for a few minutes, and you will be able to peel of the membrane created by the adhesive.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
      <li>Dip your dentures in warm water for a few minutes, and you will be able to peel of the membrane created by the adhesive.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
      <li>However, once you&#x27;ve done that -- IT&#x27;S WORTH IT.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>I have returned to my old faithful that holds dentures much better.</li>
      <li>Maybe the pain of removing the c grip will be worth it just to feel some what normal!!!</li>
      <li>my thanks to echoscream for his/hers very useful tutorial, I wish you luck with Cushion Grip.</li>
      <li>Dentures stay in super nice for a long period of time, no after taste.</li>
      <li>I warm the tube in very hot water, clean and dry the dentures in a dry sink into which I also place the tube so everything gets heated up nicely.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK but not any better than other adhesives on the market.</li>
      <li>did loosen pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know about wearing for more that 24 hours since I want to brush and clean my mouth and teeth daily anyway.</li>
      <li>I have original dentures still thanks to Cushion Grip</li>
      <li>I tried all the pastes, waxes, and other gummy goopy products to get comfort OR a good hold.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t last as long as the relining kits but still does a good job and fairly easy to use with no bad taste or smell.</li>
      <li>Also, the delivery was right on schedule.  </li>
      <li>I would like to know this does not seem right.</li>
      <li>In the morning dentures come right out not stuck at all.</li>
      <li>It just peels right off in one piece.   </li>
      <li>It lasted all of 10 minutes and it peeled right off.  </li>
      <li>I do recommend it if you need an adjustment but cant get it done right away</li>
      <li>But right now I am wearing temporary dentures, I just got my teeth pulled 6 weeks ago</li>
      <li>If I tried to eat with them, the lower denture fell right out.</li>
      <li>sure the dentures are clean and free from all residue of any other adhesive</li>
      <li>For 3 weeks at a time they fit like they did when I first got them 15 years ago, really, the stuff lasts for up to 3 weeks.</li>
      <li>Even with taking them out to clean every day the application lasts not for 4 days but much longer.  </li>
      <li>but my upper denture just did not feel nearly as secure as it did when I used either Super Poli-grip or Secure, so</li>
      <li>I found that Polident powder was the best in this category of temporary denture adhesives, lasting less than a day.&lt;br /&gt;Before</li>
      <li>This product was pretty easy to apply, lasts for weeks with normal use and nightly soaks</li>
      <li>far as the product goes, there were so many positive reviews I felt</li>
      <li>This product is pure garbage!</li>
      <li>This product is a very effective soft liner for dentures that are loose after bone loss.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for filling space on ill fitting dentures but not for new one or ones that fit.</li>
      <li>Lasts for weeks for this purpose - I still use Secure &#x27;with&#x27; myrrh and aloe vera to hold the denture in place, the regular Secure doesnt work at all. .</li>
      <li>I discovered that I apply the cushion grip and about 2 hours later take out dentures and apply light layer of polygrip zinc free and it holds like never before...</li>
      <li>your dentures will hold perfectly well, and last easily a few days.&lt;br</li>
      <li>your dentures will hold perfectly well, and last easily a few days.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have used the instant smile &amp; &amp;#34;secure smile&amp;#34; cosmetic veneers &amp; hoped this would work better than say polident.</li>
      <li>The price was very reasonable.</li>
      <li>Product works better than any other product available for dentures.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like a layer of putty that molds to your particular soft tissues.</li>
      <li>This stuff works great if you need something to get you by until you can afford a hard realign of your dentures.</li>
      <li>After reading rave reviews on Cushion Grip, I was excited to try it after getting my new dentures (also a first timer with the dentures).</li>
      <li>He rates it higher in comfort and adhesiveness.</li>
      <li>I put 1 star because of all the 1 star reviews -I look at those first on products -this</li>
      <li>This product does exactly what it says.</li>
      <li>I see that denture tabs are at least as cheap at Target, probably cheap at dollar stores--I don&#x27;t know for sure about dollar stores.&lt;br /&gt;--------------------&lt;br</li>
      <li>Amazing--the paste adhesive worked even better when it WASN&#x27;T properly</li>
      <li>I just now ordered a four-pack to keep on hand when my first order runs out, and I&#x27;m going to continue ordering four-packs</li>
      <li>Do exactly what it says in the instructions</li>
      <li>You can stiss put regular denture adhesive on top of it, but I don&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>I have been a denture wearer for many years and have religiously used fixodent.</li>
      <li>so it is shooting hot air at the dentures and cushion grip</li>
      <li>everything has to be hot to work.</li>
      <li>be afraid - aggressively apply these products and use them to the maximum and you will be very pleased to see how good they work</li>
      <li>I followed the directions exactly</li>
      <li>Sure, just because of that reason I listed above about the food.</li>
      <li>I have found a different product that I like better</li>
      <li>I had to throw it away after the first use......</li>
      <li>(Better to go out in public with my denture in than without.)</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m pretty well stuck in the house.&lt;br</li>
      <li>First off I would not call this adhesive.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It goes,, put a hairdryer and tube of cushion grip in the sink on HOT for 1 minute and it heats up the tube and dentures for easier application.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>Remember to follow the directions exactly</li>
      <li>First thing I ate with Cushion Grip? PEANUTS.</li>
      <li>I will be purchasing a LOT of this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those trying Cushion Grip for the first time:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>I have relief for the first time in five months.  </li>
      <li>Prior to using this I was able to wear my uppers gooped up with adhesive.</li>
      <li>next day I made sure that I followed the instructions, again to a &amp;#34;t&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>Held my father&#x27;s teeth in for a short period of time, then they released their strength on the gums and my dad needed to use more.</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t let that bother me and kept my dentures in that night for the first time since I got them.  </li>
      <li>Apply to lower denture first.</li>
      <li>I threw the remains of that tube away and bought more at the local CVC.  </li>
      <li>I made sure to follow the instructions exactly in the next application, and it went on like a dream.  </li>
      <li>I can actually wear my top dentures now and even eat with them in.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I only ordered one tube to try it.</li>
      <li>For more than ten years,I have tried every type of adhesive, but continued to gag and have the denture slip out.  </li>
      <li>I was only 54 when I had to have my top teeth removed.  </li>
      <li>I wept the first time I saw myself  without teeth.</li>
      <li>It holds pretty well.</li>
      <li>I am glad I only purchased one Tube (which by the way went into the Trash Can)</li>
      <li>Well, CUSHION grip requires placing tube in hot water for about 5 or so minutes and then applying to dentures.  </li>
      <li>I have used Cushion Grip for several years and am generally satisfied with the results.</li>
      <li>this stuff feels great but doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like</li>
      <li>It serves the same purpose as the product where you pour the liquid into the powder, stir, pour on your dentures, stick them in your mouth, and wait for so many minutes, take them out, and trim away excess -- but this is easier.  </li>
      <li>like I had real teeth again!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had my first relinment yet.</li>
      <li>product works well when tube is first heated in hot water to help the adhesive flow</li>
      <li>EXACTLY -</li>
      <li>No luck getting it to last more than one day.</li>
      <li>seam around the top of tube is starting to bulge ...</li>
      <li>maybe that is what they had in mind in the first place?</li>
      <li>Time and was exactly as it was described</li>
      <li>Product is tricky to use at first but we are learning.</li>
      <li>The product doesn&#x27;t hold for more than a short time -</li>
      <li>If you wear dentures this is great,food or drink do not wash it away,I have tried others and they have washed away when I drink hot tea.</li>
      <li>No, I was very dissatisfied on the price I was charged for product!</li>
      <li>It does do exactly what it advertises.</li>
      <li>I started using hot water to soften the gel</li>
      <li>You are better off using a reline kit or just regular denture adhesive.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted, and came sooner than they said.</li>
      <li>This was exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I recently found one product that worked enough to see me thru one meal, but Cushion Grip is in a league of its own!</li>
      <li>and then it burns a bit when you first place your dentures in your mouth after applying it.  </li>
      <li>I really do like this denture product!</li>
      <li>My husband and my dentures are old and we both need new ones but the cushion grip helps us to be able to keep them in our mouth without them falling out and when we eat it helps to keep seeds and things out from under them.</li>
      <li>Very useful product, met my expectations completely...........</li>
      <li>Close my mouth till comfortable not tight.  </li>
      <li>I have such a problem with my lower denture making sore spots and moving around while I try to eat and this product makes them stay put and is super comfortable.</li>
      <li>Great product that is no more !</li>
      <li>I am still not convinced this is right for me but having found a much cheaper supply will persevere</li>
      <li>If you are having trouble with the pain of mouth sores or loose fitting dentures you will want to give this a try !!!!</li>
      <li>This product looked identical in all ways but when I used it it was soft and never hardened like the product I am familiar with.</li>
      <li>I honestly can forget I have anything foreign in my mouth.  </li>
      <li>It took me a couple times to get it right, but once in, my dentures felt nice and tight and for awhile</li>
      <li>the first try, dry plate and apply more over the first layer.    </li>
      <li>Even when my family member would smile, eat, and talk, it wouldn&#x27;t be whole heartedly done, because the grip of the dentures weren&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
      <li>Since I have to use this product anyway, it&#x27;s much cheaper and way more convenient to order it on line instead of at the local drug store.</li>
      <li>I think the positive feed backs are from the manufactor friends or something to make it sell.</li>
      <li>have been wearing my new partials for about 6 weeks, give or take a couple of days, and I had several adjustments to make them tolerable enough to eat anything more challenging that soup.</li>
      <li>As long as I am satisfied with it, why try anything else?</li>
      <li>I eat pretty much what ever I want.  </li>
      <li>I used to have to clean and then apply adhesive cream followed with an adhesive powder on top of that just to have them stay for a few hours the start again.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s important to first seat your upper denture in your mouth without Cushion Grip on it.</li>
      <li>but once you get the hang of it, it is really easy to use and it works wonders for holding in the bottom plates especially.  </li>
      <li>I just got a top denture 4 months ago, and spent the first two months (as the extraction sites healed, swelling reduced, etc.)</li>
      <li>complete upper dentures.&lt;br /&gt;The dentures I got look much better than my own teeth for the last 20 years, but trying to enjoy life with them is not easy.&lt;br /&gt;After overcoming a short period of depression, I have tried several products, and I was lucky to find Cushion Grip advertised at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Everything</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d force myself to wear the lowers for certain occasions but they were miserable.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>If you were smart, you would dump them too.</li>
      <li>I guess there is one positive - you don&#x27;t have to scrape it out of your mouth because it absolutely does not stick.</li>
      <li>No matter how much you clean it off, moer of it squishes right back out again.</li>
      <li>Since I began using Cushion Grip it is like a new world!!</li>
      <li>This item was advertised to hold loose fitting in need of realigning dentures.  </li>
      <li>I Love this product, I helps my lower dentures stay in place, I still have to use glue but not very much</li>
      <li>Recommend this product very highly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;the price is very high.</li>
      <li>Soak dentures in warm water and you can work the old Cushion Grip loose in one piece.</li>
      <li>The taste is strong for a little while but that goes away, some tingle when first put in, but then again goes away quickly</li>
      <li>Nice little tube wringer with it.  </li>
      <li>I love the way they fit and this was not as hard to use as people made it seem.</li>
      <li>is there until you are ready to remove it.</li>
      <li>I have always found what I needed at Amazon at reasonable prices.</li>
      <li>product adheres very well to dentures.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t really need this Cushion Grip stuff</li>
      <li>but I know that I could go much, much longer if need be.</li>
      <li>is fast.</li>
      <li>I followed the directions very carfully</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect a miracle as dentures are an imperfect replacement for the real thing.</li>
      <li>I do this and never have a problem the whole day or evening.</li>
      <li>I know it doesn&#x27;t seem like much, but when you don&#x27;t have that much coming in to begin with, you want what you buy to deliver.</li>
      <li>could not believe how much it burned my gums.</li>
      <li>Then I&#x27;m looking for another product or way to reline my denture without dishing out the $550 my dentist wants to charge me.</li>
      <li>Have used this for awhile,wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much.</li>
      <li>and I try not to clamp my teeth or move my mouth much.</li>
      <li>It took awhile to get used to how much to use.</li>
      <li>To much</li>
      <li>It does harden over time, but it lasts much longer than 4 days.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It really does work.  </li>
      <li>The only disadvantage is that it isn&#x27;t available in brick and mortar stores.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m talking straight chemicals and it was so gooey</li>
      <li>Cushion grip really works.</li>
      <li>But Cushion Grip really works and your gums do not be sore.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t do anything else I&#x27;d hoped, though, and it is the very devil to scrape off the inside of dentures.  </li>
      <li>It worked really well as a cushion</li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>This product shapes to the contours of my upper palate and stays secure for days.  </li>
      <li>It was very tramatic.</li>
      <li>but  price went up cant use it as much as i need to thanks</li>
      <li>and I have no complaints that you so much</li>
      <li>They ship is fast and at no charge.  </li>
      <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
      <li>No mixing ,etc., - just  put on your dentures, spread around (I wet the tip of my finger and spread it or push it around would describe it better), and put them in your mouth and go.  </li>
      <li>Now my aunt really didn&#x27;t complain of a problem there ethier.</li>
      <li>This product worked very well for cushioning and holding my dentures in place.</li>
      <li>I have not tried to remove the stuff yet, so cannot really speak to that</li>
      <li>Not a scientist, but since vinegar is very acidic, it makes sense to me that it might help soften this stuff up.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
      <li>Until you start to eat any thing, then your dentures just start flapping around in your mouth, very diappointed I am.....</li>
      <li>This product is not thin and gooey.</li>
      <li>Really pricey for what it is and does.  </li>
      <li>I expected much more.  </li>
      <li>TO WORK WITH TO APPLY TO DENTURES AND VERY PRICEY FOR THE PRODUCT.</li>
      <li>I cant afford to pay 62.00 nor 248.00 thanks fir nothing</li>
      <li>I think  everyone that tries it would like or love it.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much.</li>
      <li>I also appreciated my fellow Amazonians answering my questions.&lt;br /&gt;Christine Schulz</li>
      <li>Really Really like it.</li>
      <li>THEY ARE LOSING SOOOO MUCH</li>
      <li>Much better than I expected,</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Very embarassing.</li>
      <li>The dentures feel SO secure, and I even ate some thick slices of roast beef for lunch and was able to chew it without the dentures moving even a millimeter.  </li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m going to keep giving it a fair chance, at least, until I run out of it.until</li>
      <li>I am quite handy as I have modified quite a few pair of the teeth to appear as real teeth.</li>
      <li>someone has had success with this along with the *modified* instant smile type cosmetic teeth, please write a review.&lt;br /&gt;Polident, polident strips along w the powder is the way to go w these</li>
      <li>WOW!!!</li>
      <li>I actually ate comfortabley tonight for the first time in 6 weeks of having my teeth pulled!!</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t think it is any better than any other product like this.</li>
      <li>Cushion Grip is WAY BETTER than all the other denture adhesives.</li>
      <li>Much better than any other product I have tried.</li>
      <li>I had tried many products and this one worked extremely well.  </li>
      <li>Not only does it take 15 minutes to follow the steps properly, but the first time that I put anything into my mouth to chew both top and bottom fell out.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work any better than any other adhesive.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok but not what I expected to me this is priced way to high for what it is</li>
      <li>For those Older denture users who have lower dentures, this product is very helpful for you .</li>
      <li>You can actually take them out and clean them and the paste stays unless you peel it off .</li>
      <li>Again holds my dentures securely, no gunk to remove after you take them out and evens allows you to use denture soak, &amp; no nasty taste or no mint taste that makes everything taste minty;)</li>
      <li>Cushion Grip is a top reviewed product on several sights, but I did not see any references to people using it on anything other than full</li>
      <li>I recently had a full lower plate done over the summer.  </li>
      <li>Arrived early, exactly as described.</li>
      <li>Good product,too expensive to reorder more later.</li>
      <li>Be aware that the product will not adhere to a denture that already has a soft liner.</li>
      <li>If this isn&#x27;t some massive price gouging, a $7 + tube of cushion grip you could get at CVS going for $20 good luck with that little venture</li>
      <li>I thought the shipping was a little much, but aside from that okay.</li>
      <li>This denture was nearly new!  </li>
      <li>I could not have remediated these issues with this product, and it does &amp;#34;ooze&amp;#34; to fit (although you can&#x27;t feel it), and I would have been very concerned about the suction pulling out my plugs in the new extraction sights, causing dry socket, if I had tried to use it to soon.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I paid more for this one tube, $21.44, than I did for 4 tubes previously.  </li>
      <li>After using Cushion Grip for more than 5 years at less than $ 7.00 for a one Oz.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my husband, he used it and said that it didn&#x27;t hold his bottom denture in AT ALL and that only held his top denture in for a short time, maybe 8 hours.  </li>
      <li>Does not last more than regular adhesives.   </li>
      <li>Today I tried the Comfort Grip for the first time, not really believing that all the hype could be true.  </li>
      <li>For a quick fix that lasts I would definitely recommend this.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s more difficult to get a power supply connection to fit it!</li>
      <li>Surprised to read all the positive reviews.  </li>
      <li>Better than strips, gooey mess, or powder.</li>
      <li>I love not having to scrape that gooey mess off the roof of my mouth...</li>
      <li>Very hard to remove from dentures the hold wasnt good.</li>
      <li>I will highly recommend it to every body how wears dentures.</li>
      <li>purchased two tubes in 2013 for 14.99 this one tube cost $29.00 with 6.99 for shipping...very high price????</li>
      <li>just takes a little more time than squirting cream and going.</li>
      <li>Ten times higher!</li>
      <li>This time I put just a little bit more of the stuff in the groove of the lower plate.  </li>
      <li>Wow tho this product made me forget I am wearing dentures and my pallet is not hurting either!!</li>
      <li>I waited patiently, although the delivery did take a little more than I had thought and it arrived 2 days ago.  </li>
      <li>I wish it would be a little more like the color of the dentures.</li>
      <li>It is worth a try, especially if you&#x27;re early in recovering and shrinking fast.</li>
      <li>, I am hoping it sets up, as they were quite comfortable and stayed in place quite well - but the burning gums were completely alarming.</li>
      <li>My partial has never been so secure.</li>
      <li>expensive but in great time</li>
      <li>Clean your dentures, dry them well and apply Cushion Grip according to instructions.  </li>
      <li>The lower plate must be thoroughly clean and dry.</li>
      <li>Plate must be thoroughly clean and dry.</li>
      <li>was a great product, but it&#x27;s way too expensive now.</li>
      <li>I think this product could possibly be useful if your dentures were way too big</li>
      <li>Now I think I am going to be able to use Cushion Grip without any trouble.  </li>
      <li>in all, the ease of use of EFFERGRIP makes it the top choice, in my humble opinion.</li>
      <li>for instant smile need to be modified teeth...</li>
      <li>for instant smile need to be modified teeth...</li>
      <li>I can see it being perhaps useful in &amp;#34;fine-tuning&amp;#34; a temporary reline kit, but DON&#x27;T confuse it with actual denture adhesive.</li>
      <li>Just smooth it out, bite down gently, let set up</li>
      <li>this product is the only thing that works on dentures that need more &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; ... my dentures have never fit quite right</li>
      <li>It is not hard at all</li>
      <li>physical appearance and my new smile go hand and</li>
      <li>By following the directions, it goes on easily and will last up to 4 days before you remove it.</li>
      <li>Once I left off the pressure, it stopped burning right away.</li>
      <li>(2) it is sticky messy but despite the cons I continue to buy and use it because the pros out weigh the cons especially having fitting dentures!</li>
      <li>I tried it and it doesn&#x27;t hold anything in place but sure does make a mess!</li>
      <li>Just pop them in warm water and put them back in without another application which makes the product last long.</li>
      <li>I live in Dexter Maine, I have checked all the stores and pharmacies and could not find the denture adhesive \\&quot;Cushion Grip\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a fairly new denture wearer, and I&#x27;ve had no luck at all with the adhesives I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>Then they would send me a new tube.</li>
      <li>Just did a new application.</li>
      <li>Perhaps I&#x27;ll give it another shot when I get new dentures, but for now its not on my list of things to buy.</li>
      <li>IN NEED OF A NEW LINER AND CAN&#x27;T AFFORD ONE</li>
      <li>New to using dentures.</li>
      <li>MY plate was new</li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t have a problem thanks to you I want be able to eat nuts or any hard produce</li>
      <li>but if you warm your dentures in very hot water for a few minutes, it will peel off with a little effort.  </li>
      <li>Less bulk &amp; more cushion than a professional soft reline.</li>
      <li>It holds the teeth securely in place, and is so comfortable, you forget you are wearing false teeth.</li>
      <li>Cushin Grip stays inplace and is very soft and shapes to your jaw.</li>
      <li>Now,I&lt;br /&gt;can go about my busy day with a high degree of self-esteem .My</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is simple and easy to apply as long as the directions are followed.  </li>
      <li>I only wish the color was more pink like gums or clear.</li>
      <li>Not only was it HOT</li>
      <li>I use a small amount of powder adhesive as well for a gripping fit.&lt;br /&gt;Roy Thornton</li>
      <li>but it does actually grip pretty well.  </li>
      <li>The instructions say to soak the tube in hot tap water for five minutes, and a key is supplied to put on the end of the tube to help you get the product out of the tube.</li>
      <li>IF YOUR GOING THROUGH YOUR EXTRACTIONS AND SOFT LINERS, THIS PRODUCT WILL HELP TO FIT YOUR DENTURES BETWEEN SOFT LINERS, AND KEEP THEM FROM SLIPPING AROUND AND RUBBING SORE SPOTS ON YOUR GUMS.</li>
      <li>the product was great, what is wrong is taking advantage of people that really need this by charging double the amount.</li>
      <li>I have used cushion grip for years, not sure why they removed it from the stores but glad I can still get it online.</li>
      <li>this product does exactly what it says it does and if used correctly, will last even longer than it boast...</li>
      <li>Ok, so really I have had problems with my lower partial ever since I had a preemptive extraction on what was an anchor tooth for my bottom partial denture.  </li>
      <li>i have a full upper and a partial lower and due to unusual circumstances, i cannot bear down evenly to get a good seal.</li>
      <li>Works fine but just doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
      <li>I bit down to get a secure seal</li>
      <li>Is it good, yes, BUT the price is way above what is called gouging, it is ridiculous.  </li>
      <li>If followed as directed it works well and is easy to remove, it&#x27;s not a bit messy</li>
      <li>Not sure what changed, probably my mouth - but it is no longer holding for more than 6 hours before it completely lets go.</li>
      <li>Soak plates in hot (not boiling) water for ten minutes to soften old Cushion Grip application.</li>
      <li>but my dentures have remained tightly seated and comfortable all day.</li>
      <li>It certainly didn&#x27;t last the 4 days as promised.  </li>
      <li>Well, when I got to work, I was on the telephone talking and felt that I could not talk right because the lower plate was once again loose.  </li>
      <li>I read so many reports about it being hard to use.  </li>
      <li>you can hardly get it for 18.00 a tube, most are over $20.  </li>
      <li>I creates a nice, secure suction to the upper palate and gums without the need for messy, hard to remove adhesives.  </li>
      <li>I would like to clear something up for those who are dissappointed with the product.</li>
      <li>so I could get a clear understanding of how to get the optimal use.  </li>
      <li>CushionGrip made it possible for him to wear partial comfortably.</li>
      <li>Although a bit pricey, at his stage in life; comfort has a value which is sometimes not cost sensitive.</li>
      <li>Amazon can&#x27;t be beat as far as I am concerned.</li>
      <li>and she can&#x27;t afford to get them fixed.</li>
      <li>Wow.</li>
      <li>They feel so snug and soft, with no adhesive.</li>
      <li>I got this product for a 95 year old young lady who says nothing else will keep her dentures in place.  </li>
      <li>I still have to use a bit of adhesive as this is not an adhesive but a soft pliable cushion liner.  </li>
      <li>My dentures would \\&quot;rock back and forth\\&quot; on the top and the partial just simply popped up.  </li>
      <li>Being retired and on a fixed income, this helps a lot.</li>
      <li>Perhaps I don&#x27;t want to find out because this is the only thing that helps me as much as it does.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t throw away the tube of CG fast enough!    </li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;m on a fixed income, and my husband is unemployed, we try to keep our expenses low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Then it didn&#x27;t burn, but it didn&#x27;t adhere completely either.</li>
      <li>They promised me I would receive a labeled package to send the old tube in.</li>
      <li>At least, it is ok while I&#x27;m not eating.</li>
      <li>It lasts much longer than stated on the package and does not have to be removed and replaced daily (as adhesives do.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If product overflowed above denture I gently trim it.</li>
      <li>The only thing is that it cost a bit much.</li>
      <li>It is not an adhesive but rather a soft liner for your dentures.  </li>
      <li>Do not waste your money on this one.</li>
      <li>It felt like I had a liquefying gummy worm candy in my dentures after several hours...and, much to my surprise, the stuff came off in a gooey mass.  </li>
      <li>THIS IS BY FAR</li>
      <li>Until it completely sets, some of it will ooze over the edges.</li>
      <li>As far as its performance, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
      <li>WOW, what a difference.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money or time ordering it.</li>
      <li>and they even stay in , so far it&#x27;s been four day that they stay in</li>
      <li>It is soft and pliable.</li>
      <li>It worked very well but it is only a temporary fix</li>
      <li>the same cushion.&lt;br /&gt;The price was to much for it..</li>
      <li>It really does last 4-5 days!!</li>
      <li>It leaves a soft layer between your gums and your denture, eliminating the &amp;#34;sucky feeling&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
      <li>Ordered this for my 85 year old father.</li>
      <li>it is a pain to apply but it is the only thing that works for more than a few minutes</li>
      <li>I REPIT THE COMENT FROM BIG G OF SEPTEMBER 28,2011.WHY TO WASTE MORE TIME FOR THIS JUNK.THEY</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t think it is worth all that trouble.</li>
      <li>By adding extra Cushion Grip, I was able to balance this trouble spot and stabilize my bite.</li>
      <li>This stuff does not hold dentures, and is a mess to clean off dentures.</li>
      <li>Who can get most foods into her mouth in just that small amount of space!</li>
      <li>I even tried letting the cream air out on my dentures--it&#x27;s an effort, just getting the cream out of the tube--hoping that exposure to air might mean better results, but that didn&#x27;t work either.</li>
      <li>It does take a little effort to clean the old liner material from your dentures</li>
      <li>It just peels right off the partial denture.  </li>
      <li>I had to make a few adjustments to account for high and low spots on my plates, but overall, I am extremely pleased.</li>
      <li>I goofed and didn&#x27;t dry my dentures first.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply and the with the small tool.</li>
      <li>I used way to much the first time and had a mess.  </li>
      <li>Dentures remain in all day and absolutely no mess when you take them out.</li>
      <li>Broke loose on the first bite.  </li>
      <li>but I think overall I have found a product that really allows me to finally eat like a normal human and feel almost normal again.</li>
      <li>the tube had a different label and when I first used it , there was a big bubble , so</li>
      <li>Since the directions were for full plates, I reduced the amount used by a little on the bottom and a lot on</li>
      <li>Highly recommend the entire process.</li>
      <li>Exactly what was expected.</li>
      <li>: If you want your temporary &amp;#34;costume&amp;#34; well modified teeth to work and look great, stick with any denture product which has the ability to both hold &#x27;em and harden (polident used w the powder not exposed to heat constantly will do this).&lt;br /&gt;Buying this product, at least for me and the folks I have helped was a waste of time and money.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
      <li>I tried to use at first worked only for a few hours, even after doing a soft reline on my denture, which was very helpful.</li>
      <li>(I use Reline-It as a replacement for hard re-lines, but many similar products are sold.)</li>
      <li>My husband tried this product following all directions to perfection and it didn&#x27;t hold worth nothing on four or five tries.  </li>
      <li>This is an excellent product and I am appalled that I could not find it locally -</li>
      <li>The bond is very secure and tough.  </li>
      <li>I take them out daily to clean and after a few days they feel slightly not as tight</li>
      <li>My experience generally with Amazon is outstanding, but this one really sucks big time.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need no other.</li>
      <li>I only have a cover so this may be different for full or partial dentures but for my cover purposes this tasted funky and wouldn&#x27;t stay put until I pressed for awhile</li>
      <li>Had to use twice as much as what instructions specified, but may be because my dentures were extremely loose.  </li>
      <li>My dentures were so loose and using so much denture adhesive to keep them in.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m somewhat new to wearing dentures, so I have been busy trying just about every way to secure my dentures in place, and out of all of the things I&#x27;ve tried, Cushion Grip was the biggest failure!  </li>
      <li>Firstly the price of this product is outragous!, while I am partially to blame for not researching beforehand, I paid $22.95 Amazon Prime and then discovered the same product in a local CVS for $7.99, some markup!&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
      <li>Everyone&#x27;s dentures wear down and so do the gums, but with Cushion Grip you can make the dentures fit tight again and delay having to have new dentures made.  </li>
      <li>I am disappointed that it isn&#x27;t available any more.</li>
      <li>BUT you shouldn&#x27;t use to completely avoid regular yearly checkups and adjustments.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>It is my go-to product as a home replacement for a soft reline and is the only product of its type that I have found anywhere.</li>
      <li>(had several professional relines/used home kits, etc.</li>
      <li>Why you are seeing the price hike is because when it is sold out it is gone sort of like the old supply and demand, The only thing I can think to do is to contact Bayer AG to encourage them to once again manufacture Cushion Grip.</li>
      <li>Went back to my old brand.  </li>
      <li>This denture thermoplastic, can be used by everyone,its like a soft reliner for your dentures last about 4weeks</li>
      <li>/&gt;But overall, the pros completely outweigh the cons.</li>
      <li>Product did not hold dentures in place even when following the directions completely as required.</li>
      <li>AGAIN IT IS WORTH ANY TROUBLE</li>
      <li>Also, for the first day or two after a new application, I have to trim off excess that has squeezed out the sides or back of the denture, and that is a little bothersome.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was very hesitant to try due to some of the reviews which made is sound so hard to do.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;You only need to put a small amount of renew in your denture bath and it will last easily two weeks to a month.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t as  easy to use as I had first thought, but it does hold, I&#x27;m just to big of a hurry, Time line sometimes makes it difficult to use.</li>
      <li>IF YOU HAVE ILL FITTING DENTURES, OR YOU ARE A NEW DENTURE WEARER, THIS PRODUCT WILL BE SO HELPFUL TO YOU.</li>
      <li>This product is so comfortable you will be wondering why this is not available everywhere!!</li>
      <li>I have had 2 sets of dentures and they both have not fit right.  </li>
      <li>Managing to find the &#x27;right&#x27; amount to use is a challenge, the recommended amount oozes everywhere</li>
      <li>First, it took me half an hour to set it all up and get the dentures in my mouth.  </li>
      <li>The BAD -its been discontinued probably by dental lobbyists because its a great alternative to going back in for relines.</li>
      <li>It will last at least 4 days and makes my dentures so secure, I can even sleep in them with no problem.  </li>
      <li>If one is too old or cannot afford to consider multiple tooth implants, one&#x27;s only solution is to wear dentures.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
      <li>I bought this item and found it was not at all applicable to the cosmetic teeth, maybe because they are thin when fixed to fit</li>
      <li>and I had to leave it in the hot tap water a little longer for it to be manageable.</li>
      <li>but...if your dentures are loose particularly if you have very little gum left (bottom plate for me...this stuff is worth the difficulty.  </li>
      <li>One is expected to dry the dentures first.</li>
      <li>Not long ago AT ALL, I could buy it at C.V.S. drugstores for about $7.00 or $8.00.</li>
      <li>You have been warned by someone who has tried it, followed directions exactly, and wishes I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money-</li>
      <li>i have gone into serious anxiety over this as i cannot believe that after 5 yrs of suffering i finally found a miracle product that is no longer available.</li>
      <li>Be sure to cover entire back edge of upper plate with a thin layer of Cushion Grip.</li>
      <li>You must be careful removing the cushion grip to put new strip in so as not to drop or damage dentures.</li>
      <li>I tried the typical gooey adhesive,the power and thought I would try this since the reviews sounded like it really works.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m new to dentures and have used the pastes that are very gooey and hard to remove when you take dentures out.</li>
      <li>That time, I had left it in for 20 minutes, pressing down the whole time as another reviewer suggested.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s as if you&#x27;re getting a new soft liner every few days.</li>
      <li>and if it is a tight space on the lower denture, get a thin strong piece of wood or something that will fit into the tight spaces and really press the material firmly on the denture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought this product and found it very comfortable, but extremely difficult to remove from my dentures.  </li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t anything worse than loose fitting dentures and adhesive that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>After the second day, I sometimes have to supplement it with a little conventional adhesive, but even then I get a much better hold than with the conventional adhesive alone.</li>
      <li>The little tube does not seem to go far with frequent applications to 2 plates.  </li>
      <li>but many times I do it wrong, too much or too little and have to scrap it all off and start over.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this one and it let me down.</li>

<li> that&#x27;s for sure!!</li>
<li> Product is fantastic!!!  </li>
<li> The number is on the internet under Schering-Plough.com and they gave me additional instructions on how to use it and were very nice.</li>
<li> This product is amazing!</li>
<li> To think I&#x27;ll be able to keep this in for 4-5 days is priceless.  </li>
<li> An excellent product, have used it for many years, and will continue to do so.  </li>
<li> It has a pleasant taste and stays put.  </li>
<li> This product is excellent, and easy to use.  </li>
<li> very good product this product holds even eating Corn on the cob love the cushion grip cant use anyting eles since i started using cushion grip</li>
<li> I used another product to reline my own dentures which worked great.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m on two weeks now and its still holding good.</li>
<li> This means that you rinse your dentures, boom, they&#x27;re good to go.</li>
<li> a good hair dryer and set it on HOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I have used this type of product before and have found it to be a good alternative to the expense of having dentures relined by Dentist.  </li>
<li> Good price always buy this product on line for my father.</li>
<li> It works good to use it at night before bed.</li>
<li> but it is the best fit you can get</li>
<li> Works good.  </li>
<li> It seems to work fairly well until you eat or drink.</li>
<li> During application, if it finds a good edge it will lift polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> this is a good product, it&#x27;s time consumimg and the directions have to be followed exactly&lt;</li>
<li> Lots of good reviews on this product, didnt work for me at all,</li>
<li> It is a good product, a cushion, something like a reline but Not an Adhesive.</li>
<li> it work good but dont know how to use it</li>
<li> If you have dentures that don&#x27;t fit well, this is the best solution!  </li>
<li> but this adhesive seems to be good stuff.  </li>
<li> She was delighted with her purchase through Amazon, since I did all the leg work in finding it she was delighted.</li>
<li> Just as good as everyone says.</li>
<li> i dont use it for dentures, i use it tofix hearing aid shells, works good.</li>
<li> works good got here</li>
<li> the price was good</li>
<li> I think this is a good product to use temporary.</li>
<li> Best product for dentures with no after taste and holds secure.</li>
<li> I will tell everynody this is a good product.</li>
<li> It has alot of good ratings, try it for yourself because what doesn&#x27;t work for one may for another.</li>
<li> This was a good product.</li>
<li> but it works fairly well.</li>
<li> No goo, no gaps -- good stuff.</li>
<li> Exceptional.</li>
<li> Fantastic product, very good service from supplier.</li>
<li> My husband is very pleased with our order of cushion grip.</li>
<li> is very pleased with this product.  </li>
<li> It was sent as stated and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
<li> love it came on time and great packaging</li>
<li> but after i got them just right there perfect!!!</li>
<li> excellent, best I&#x27;ve ever used to keep my partial in place while eating even crunchy food.</li>
<li> It took a couple of tries for me to get the perfect amount for the best hold.</li>
<li> The product is excellent, however, it is very overpriced!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m ordering more!</li>
<li> I love this stuff!</li>
<li> Love It!</li>
<li> and I am able to eat things I couldn&#x27;t eat before!</li>
<li> Ok, do my aunt told me about this product I am amazed at the moment!</li>
<li> I did not know it could help as much as it does!!!!!</li>
<li> Amazing product.</li>
<li> everything i xperienced thru Amazon and delivery to using product has just been amazing.</li>
<li> I had great expectations of this product because nothing else has worked, I followed the directions as stated and it didn&#x27;t secure my teeth at all not even minutes.</li>
<li> and you will have a great fit.</li>
<li> I was using Poligrip powder and was thrilled with it for about 3 days.</li>
<li> I had ordered Cushion Grip to have on hand just in case, and was thrilled to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> This product should be used with good fitting dentures and ones that are not roughed up.  </li>
<li> and I really liked using it&lt;br</li>
<li> Its good but just  a handful of bucks (at most)  </li>
<li> Gotta say, it&#x27;s really nice not feeling</li>
<li> The best thing I&#x27;ve tried &amp; it works really well.</li>
<li> It is a thermoplastic that once applied sets up and nicely form fits your uppers and lowers.  </li>
<li> This product really works great!!</li>
<li> Peel away the warm Cushion Grip from dentures with fingers or a wood manicure stick.</li>
<li> Nice product</li>
<li> The thing that most of us want is to keep food out from under the dentures, and to have some good cushioning betweet the gums.</li>
<li> This has a great taste and it lightly sweet.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t do a great deal to keep my dentures in place, it doesn&#x27;t make them more comfortable, and it&#x27;s aggravating to remove.  </li>
<li> easy to work with and feels good.  </li>
<li> quick is great product I will use it again</li>
<li> Just heat the tube up in hot(not boiling) water, and it is very easy to apply.  </li>
<li> Now they don&#x27;t sell it any more because the price has more than doubled --overnight!  </li>
<li> great product and best in the market will recomend to other users.</li>
<li> Easy to use, and easy directions to follow!!</li>
<li> I give it a three for the best by far</li>
<li> I have been using this product for years with great success.</li>
<li> The best denture cleaner by far on the market is Renew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> he must have liked it because he ordered more, but we never discussed it.  </li>
<li> This is by far the best adhesive I have tried.  </li>
<li> May need to trim to fit the area but good choice.</li>
<li> It is probably an effective product for most people.  </li>
<li> Amazon.com sent our order very quick and we are very pleased.</li>
<li> Just the product for a beautiful smile, great fit, easy wearing, feels comfortable in the mouth and easy to manage!</li>
<li> The Cushion Grip worked great the first time I used it.</li>
<li> Very Comfortable.</li>
<li> It makes my dentures very comfortable until I can go and get my permanent reline done.  </li>
<li> I also just saved you a lot of moneyby posting this free information about dentures and you can post your gratitude for free :o)</li>
<li> This is a good quick fix.</li>
<li> Has no unpleasant odor and good staying power.</li>
<li> waiter approached and said is that a large fly in your soup?</li>
<li> This is an ok item</li>
<li> I just want to say I am glad I used Amazon.com for my purchase for denture adhesive.</li>
<li> I love this item.</li>
<li> In addition, even after letting it set for thirty minutes or more, when the denture is removed, the cushion grip plastic like substance stays in your mouth; not in the denture.</li>
<li> It helps better than anything I have found.  </li>
<li> and the supply of it will no longer be available!</li>
<li> My mother had needed some more Cushion Grip</li>
<li> Also, I think someone suggested adding fixodent on top of it</li>
<li> so it will adhere to your gums better.</li>
<li> I love powdered adhesives, because you take the dentures outa the soak water.</li>
<li> and you will be satisfied.  </li>
<li> it is more like a liner.  </li>
<li> I feel so confident now</li>
<li> I work at a church. :-)</li>
<li> I LOVE IT.</li>
<li> - just make sure you divide the cushion grip material up and</li>
<li> It also conforms to where it is needed most.</li>
<li> so I don&#x27;t use this any more.</li>
<li> Bubblegum would do a better job, and taste nicer.</li>
<li> Stores just don&#x27;t seem to carry it any more.  </li>
<li> We&#x27;re glad to find it online at Amazon.  </li>
<li> I love it</li>
<li> I have tried numerous products the best of which was denturite by sea bond</li>
<li> I am so glad I found the dental  thermoplastic</li>
<li> It is a soft, cushiony reline that makes them fit so perfectly that they no longer need to be &#x27;glued&#x27; in place.  </li>
<li> sticks well and helps line poorly fitting dentures.</li>
<li> I tried it on my top but it would not keep them in place</li>
<li> I will keep searching for something more permanant</li>
<li> I have tried this many times.</li>
<li> or you wont be satisfied.</li>
<li> Love it.</li>
<li> I had been fighting poorly fitting dentures--no matter what the dentist did they ate up my gums.  </li>
<li> intend to try the hair dryer method mentioned in another review to get more use out of one application.</li>
<li> well thats what uou pay for something that is going to feel better for hours .</li>
<li> AND I LOVE IT.</li>
<li> SO GLAD</li>
<li> Many, many reviews about this product gave it a five star.  </li>
<li> It would really be nice to have the lower plate stay secure in my mouth for 4 days (as the manufacture</li>
<li> why can&#x27;t I buy it any more???</li>
<li> I am so glad that Amazon has it online.</li>
<li> I will be ordering some more just in case Amazon might run out..</li>
<li> I&#x27;m glad I found it</li>
<li> I am going to do everything under my power to be sure this company gets what they deserve.</li>
<li> I was quite pleased .</li>
<li> Satisfied with results.</li>
<li> Make sure you read the instructions and use it accordingly.</li>
<li> I have ordered this many times.</li>
<li> Im better off with the powder.</li>
<li> I do better with Fixodent...  </li>
<li> I love this stuff, it has worked miracles for me.</li>
<li> I could not wear my top denture without gagging.</li>
<li> I was told about this by a friend and thought what the heck, and I love it</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re looking for the perfect denture adhesive, look no further.   </li>
<li> It works better than my expectations.</li>
<li> the most I could get was three at the most.</li>
<li> It will make your dentures feel better</li>
<li> Overall the product works wonderfully.</li>
<li> and I have not been able to find it anywhere except on the internet.</li>
<li> It takes a while to get used to fitting it around the inside of the dentures</li>
<li> but after many trials, opted for another adhesive product.  </li>
<li> Besides, it costs a lot more than the EFFERGRIP.  </li>
<li> For some folks, this could be seen as okay because CUSHION GRIP doesn&#x27;t need to be applied every day</li>
<li> I love this product and I will always use this.</li>
<li> you read any further about Cushion Grip, I refer you to the excellent tutorial by echoscream.&lt;br /&gt;To</li>
<li> It makes my dentures for a lot better than they did.</li>
<li> Be sure and use it sparingly -</li>
<li> and I feel I had to use more</li>
<li> putting ok on this for now  arrived on 6th</li>
<li> She loves it and it works better than we thought it would.</li>
<li> I love cushion grip.</li>
<li> just keep it &amp; be  satisfied</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve TRIED many Denture Adhesives, even the pads.</li>
<li> My Mother had ordered this from a book for many years.</li>
<li> This works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
<li> Did not want to have more denture issues out.  </li>
<li> Ayway, the stuff was magic.  </li>
<li> Am sure I will get faster and more efficient doing the cushion gripping.  </li>
<li> But as I get more and more skilled I expect to rave about it</li>
<li> it is ok , helpt me many times</li>
<li> /&gt;I will be buying more Cushion Grip, even after I get my permanent dentures.</li>
<li> I am so glad I did.</li>
<li> I am now able to eat without my lower plate giving me a problem.</li>
<li> My favorite app.</li>
<li> I love it.</li>
<li> Suddenly, most stores like Walmart and Rite Aid stopped selling it.</li>
<li> The seller made sure that the product was delivered in a timely fashion, and there was no damage to it.</li>
<li> We will be ordering again, for sure.</li>
<li> I love this stuff.  </li>
<li> So glad I ordered this one.</li>
<li> Could not find in stores so glad to find it on here</li>
<li> I love it, however...</li>
<li> the price makes it unaffordable for most people who need to use it,</li>
<li> Was not any better than anything else I have tried.</li>
<li> Try it, I&#x27;m sure you will like it.</li>
<li> Need this for my teeth  think I&#x27;ll order more</li>
<li> I love cushion grip but you have almost tripled your price.</li>
<li> I use to be able to get 4 tubes for 20$.....</li>
<li> and I was very excited.  </li>
<li> (I love sharing this kind of cool</li>
<li> Great idea!would highly reccommend.</li>
<li> so I decided to try it based on how consistent the good reviews were.</li>
<li> I will teach you have to take full responsibility of your own health</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t tried corn on the cob yet or apples but everything else has been pretty good.  </li>
<li> Not as good as when I first started to use it.</li>
<li> Followed the directions which were easy, although I think I could have allowed more time for the stuff to &amp;</li>
<li> I love this product, makes wearing dentures so much more comfortable.</li>
<li> When used properly it will fit perfectly to your gums and palate.</li>
<li> This is truly the best product I have found for giving my dentures a tight and more secure feeling!</li>
<li> (the price on Renew is very good also) and found the following to be true:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> (1) makes dentures fit like a glove (2) can eat most foods when applied (3)</li>
<li> and you will be set free to enjoy the best health possible in life.</li>
<li> As a cheap I&#x27;m out of everything this is ok</li>
<li> It made my dentures immensely more comfortable</li>
<li> I was looking for a better grip than the Secure Denture Adhesive.  </li>
<li> Cost on Cushion Grip is out of this world and would like to find it at a better cheap price, rather than being &#x27;RIPPED OFF&#x27; on eBay!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
<li> Although it is not an adhesive in the sense that it sticks to your gum,it does provide a tighter more cushioned fit.</li>
<li> So far this worked great for me.  </li>
<li> it made his smile nice and not lopsided</li>
<li> Worked well making my dentures fit better and more comfortably until I get a realingnment.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried other products &amp; this one works the best for me...</li>
<li> Easy to use.</li>
<li> Easy to manipulate in the&lt;br /&gt;form that is needed.</li>
<li> Not that easy to put on dentures as it is of a plastic consistency and tube must be heated before using it - then must wait awhile for it to somewhat harden and set.</li>
<li> Removal is also easy (again, follow</li>
<li> The instructions were easy to follow and apply.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> but it does not come off of the denture easily.</li>
<li> If you follow the instructions it is relatively easy to apply.</li>
<li> Easy to apply lasts for me up to 7days and removes easily.</li>
<li> I found that it is easy to remove then</li>
<li> I found this to be almost as easy as applying ploy grip.</li>
<li> I use this all the time and it is easy to reorder it  on Amazon.</li>
<li> Was fairly easy to apply when I obeyed the instructions.</li>
<li> even if i had gotten a good seal, the price is too high.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and to remove just run warm or hot water over your denture.</li>
<li> It feels warm at first  </li>
<li> Warm the capped tube in hot tap water (not boiling) for 5 minutes.</li>
<li> Just tried again, and seems fine.  </li>
<li> This may be fine for others..</li>
<li> But I grinned and beared it (pardon the pun) and all was fine.</li>
<li> the only thing that would make it better is if you didn&#x27;t have to warm it up to get it out of the tube!</li>
<li> no bad taste no messy cream great for eating.</li>
<li> and you will be fine</li>
<li> NOT because it was wearing out), and not only prevents sore spots from rubbing, but also creates a perfect \\&quot;vacuum\\&quot; seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, as others have mentioned, I do notice a tingling/burning sensation on the first application, but it goes away within minutes.  </li>
<li> When dentures wear down after awhile this is an one of the best I&#x27;ve found to making the dentures fit like they are suppose to.</li>
<li> Warm to reasonably heated water as a mouth wash, will allow you to unglue your dentures easily in a couple of minutes, and wash them.</li>
<li> Warm to reasonably heated water as a mouth wash, will allow you to unglue your dentures easily in a couple of minutes, and wash them.</li>
<li> This stuff is great for adding a lining to loose fitting dentures.</li>
<li> Was very easy to clean out of the plate, just peeled right out.  </li>
<li> If you&#x27;re in a huge hurry, go to CVS.</li>
<li> After that I use my regular adhesive and dentures fit great.</li>
<li> This product is no longer available where I live,but Amazon had it and I will order it again when needed.</li>
<li> This product made a comfortable cushion for my dentures, but it did not adhere well to my gums.  </li>
<li> &amp; it never worked, I thought  when I bought Cushion Grip it would be A great denture adhesive, so i purchase four big mistake i tryed to get a refund but never did.</li>
<li> but it does make for a comfortable hold.</li>
<li> but they saw fit to discontinue.  </li>
<li> But it is supposed to make a difference in the fit, of your denture, which, to some degree, it does.</li>
<li> It is extremely comfortable.</li>
<li> /&gt;For those of us who cannot afford a trip to the dentist for a re-line every time gum erosion causes the fit to change, this product is a life-saver.  </li>
<li> Fantastic product but WAY</li>
<li> I will stick to Secure from now on.</li>
<li> Teeth feel tight&lt;br /&gt;and secure.</li>
<li> I order me six tubes for only twenty-three dollars and that is great.</li>
<li> The &#x27;Secure&#x27; denture cream is what holds dentures in place, I think.</li>
<li> My husband has used this brand to secure his dentures for years...</li>
<li> I&#x27;m cheap</li>
<li> I soak my dentures nightly and it does not effect the fit or cushion.</li>
<li> Holds well and is comfortable.</li>
<li> I stumbled across it accidently for him and found that it did the job great and is not a daily reliner for his denture.  </li>
<li> It makes them feel secure</li>
<li> There is a detailed review by &#x27;Robert&#x27;  on the item</li>
<li> , I guess my lesson learned is you need a SECURE HOLDING DENTURE to use this product.&lt;br</li>
<li> Anyone who does not want to take the time to fit them-forget them.</li>
<li> Stay away.e who does not want to take the time to fit them-forget them.</li>
<li> i only got this product as my neighbor said it was great</li>
<li> I followed the directions precisely, it burned like heck for over 5 minutes and let go after 22 minutes.  </li>
<li> My recommendation is don&#x27;t go cheap and go to your dentist for any repairs or re-alignment you have to get done.</li>
<li> I had met with my oral surgeon about installing 4 implants to secure my lower plate.</li>
<li> This is a fantastic product.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years to help adjust the fit of my dentures.</li>
<li> there is no room for it to fit between the gums and teeth.</li>
<li> This product is fantastic.  </li>
<li> Love the product..........  Not crazy about the price.....</li>
<li> It was ok but was not to impress was to much to do it might be ok for others but not my cup of tea</li>
<li> I have found that it continues to &#x27;set&#x27; (gradually becoming more hardened) for the first 24-36 hours.  </li>
<li> The only product of this type that really works perfectly.</li>
<li> Look at the drawing that comes in the box, and make sure you surround as if in a circle the Palate part of your denture.&lt;br /&gt;Remember that if the palate is perfectly glued to the dome of your mouth, (sometimes even creating a sucker effect)</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t been able to eat right since I got my dentures 3 years ago</li>
<li> He was excited to know he can order it through Amazon.  </li>
<li> Just minutes ago I tried it for the first time, and can I tell you - my denture feels more snug than the day I had it put in.    </li>
<li> The beauty of this product is that it builds up your dentures so you they feel like they did when you first got them, maybe even better.</li>
<li> so i tried just sprinkling with an adhesive powder and unbelievably the combination is GREAT!!!</li>
<li> Cushion Grip is by far the best product on the market for comfortably fitting all dentures, even partial dentures.&lt;br</li>
<li> I am familiar with this product although I question why there was a recall.</li>
<li> I am never disappointed with my amazon purchases.</li>
<li> I wish another company would pick this product up and start making it at the original price of under $10.00.</li>
<li> I followed the directions on the paper insert and was able to wear my lowers all day for the first time since I&#x27;ve had them.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
<li> I guess somebody has to get rich.</li>
<li> Did OK the First time I used it ---For 1 day.</li>
<li> as long as you don&#x27;t plan on eating works great, or a baby food or liquid diet....</li>
<li> works great, makes my partial comfortable to wear all day</li>
<li> It is the only denture cream she&#x27;s found that works good and is comfortable.</li>
<li> You can clean your dentures with whatever method you prefer and the adhesive will still adhere.</li>
<li> , your gums change all the time - this product gives you a constant good fit</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and it really works when your dentures don&#x27;t fit exactly right.</li>
<li> For people with loose dentures that can&#x27;t afford the high price of relining, this is the best.</li>
<li> I however need more time to come to a positive conclusion as to the true value of this item.</li>
<li> my thanks to echoscream for his/hers very useful tutorial, I wish you luck with Cushion Grip.rawing that comes in the box, and make sure you surround as if in a circle the Palate part of your denture.&lt;br /&gt;Remember that if the palate is perfectly glued to the dome of your mouth, (sometimes even creating a sucker effect)</li>
<li> it run for one minute which super dries the dentures and significantly heats up</li>
<li> works great, especially on older dentures that may have worn a bit and become loose.</li>
<li> Soft thermoplastic denture adhesive is very comfortable and relatively easy to use.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if this is a problem for most users or if it&#x27;s a rare occurrence, but for the first fifteen minutes or so the adhesive burned my gums and palate.</li>
<li> MERCK HAS STOPPED MANUFACTURING CUSHION GRIP, WHY, UNKNOWN, BUT NOT AN INTELLIGENT BUSINESS DECISION.  </li>
<li> DONT USE MY FULL NAME  </li>
<li> It is such good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I put in warm water till soft, roll it like a worm and sit it in the denture.</li>
<li> It does need to be used with reg adhesive because Cushion Grip is not an true adhesive, just builds up and fills in dentures.</li>
<li> I have Full uppers and a lower &amp;#34;bridge.</li>
<li> You gotta have this stuff if you wear Dr. Bailey&#x27;s Secure Smile teeth.</li>
<li> I love the fact that I can just pop my dentures in and be ready to go.</li>
<li> really need more practice</li>
<li> and it feels like a sift cushoin I love it , the seller was fast delivery</li>
<li> All I use is some extra hold powder adhesive, and I am good to go.  </li>
<li> Although CUSHION GRIP is  a good product, it takes second place, in my opinion, to EFFERGRIP.  </li>
<li> This is a good product, &amp; thank God I only needed it temporarily, as all amazon sellers are price gouging on it because it&#x27;s being discontinued!</li>
<li> hope this is helpful, if so please check the appropriate box, Thanks.</li>
<li> No bad taste.</li>
<li> Great for new and old denture wearers.  </li>
<li> The detailed descriptions of HOW TO are right on.</li>
<li> i am really impressed by what this stuff is able to do,it is easy to work with and is miles ahead of anything else iv&#x27;e tried for making loose dentures fit better and more comfortably,anyone who has never tried it and is having trouble with poor fitting dentures don&#x27;t hesitate to give this a shot,its really amazing</li>
<li> This stuff works great for other things too.</li>
<li> But as long as I had it in, it felt good and made it more tolerable in eating because it wouldn&#x27;t let as much food up under the lower denture.</li>
<li> Best product I have ever used,no more loose dentures and most of all no more need for polygrip.</li>
<li> A new application gives better results on a clean denture surface.</li>
<li> The more times you apply the material you get better with the application and find you can use less with better results.  </li>
<li> We looked in many stores but were only able to find it online.  </li>
<li> This product always arrives quick and is never damaged.  </li>
<li> Thankfully, I was sitting in the car waiting for a friend who had run in quickly to get something.  </li>
<li> When he needs more, I&#x27;ll definitely buy more for him.</li>
<li> Although like I said I used more then recommended since my pallet is sore from the top denture rocking back and forth!</li>
<li> My product arrived quickly and this weekend, I gave it</li>
<li> Shipped quickly and holds well.</li>
<li> I have tried everything to keep my bottom dentures in, i then seen the cushion grip thermoplastic denture adhesive and how it could hold denture for up to 4 days, What a load of rubbish ,you will be lucky if your dentures stay in for 4 hours ,never mind 4 days.&lt;br</li>
<li> too expensive but is a wonderful product works better than anything else i have tried but too pricey</li>
<li> AND SO ARE THEIR LOYAL CUSTOMERS.  </li>
<li> Removing the old adhesive, is very easy.</li>
<li> Removing the old adhesive, is very easy.</li>
<li> I thought I was going to finally be able to eat normally again.</li>
<li> very hot water.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
<li> After discovering this product I was able to stabilize the wire and wait until my normal visit.  </li>
<li> She is very pleased with it and now has the address for future needs and order purposed.  </li>
<li> You would be better getting new dentures or relining.</li>
<li> may be great for normal actual dentures but</li>
<li> may be great for normal actual dentures but</li>
<li> I love this product and will continue to purchase it as long as it is available!</li>
<li> Thanks Amazon!!</li>
<li> I bought it locally, it turns out I paid a couple bucks more!</li>
<li> I soak my dentures over night every day and have the cleanest, most beautiful dentures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For partial dentures, do the same thing</li>
<li> My mom needed it for her dentures, she needed a reline and we lived far from that dentist, so this lasted plenty until she could get to the dentist! :)</li>
<li> When I first bought Cushion Grip Thermoplastic Adhesive, which, by the way, I found at CVS, I was so excited.</li>
<li> really rip off this used to cost $6.00 a tube !!  </li>
<li> She said to just soak them in hot water and it comes off!</li>
<li> It does exactly what it says it does: it *cushions* your gums!</li>
<li> but if you apply it right, it will last more than a month easily from one application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> This product is not available everywhere, so I was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
<li> Nothing too amazing about cushion grip, simply holds well.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
<li> Wow, do I love this stuff, or WHAT?</li>
<li> you want more information or you have questions, you can arrange a time to talk with me one on one as I am a top level health consultant in every area of human health and my rates are reasonable.</li>
<li> , it would&#x27;ve been worth it.  </li>
<li> The manufacturer needs to contact my family member for a truly honest,  bona fide commercial.</li>
<li> This product is definitely worth trying if adhesive alone does not do the job.  </li>
<li> Degree of success will vary with each person.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Regardless of removal issues, Cushion Grip is worth its weight in gold.</li>
<li> Worth the hassle and will be reordering soon.</li>
<li> keeping this handy to put it back in position no one knew.</li>
<li> Attach enclosed slotted key to end of warm Cushion Grip tube.</li>
<li> This stuff is not at all what I expected after reading all the good reviews before purchase.</li>
<li> Wasn&#x27;t worth the money</li>
<li> Dip your dentures in warm water for a few minutes, and you will be able to peel of the membrane created by the adhesive.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
<li> Dip your dentures in warm water for a few minutes, and you will be able to peel of the membrane created by the adhesive.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
<li> However, once you&#x27;ve done that -- IT&#x27;S WORTH IT.</li>
<li> Well worth the money.</li>
<li> I have returned to my old faithful that holds dentures much better.</li>
<li> Maybe the pain of removing the c grip will be worth it just to feel some what normal!!!</li>
<li> my thanks to echoscream for his/hers very useful tutorial, I wish you luck with Cushion Grip.</li>
<li> Dentures stay in super nice for a long period of time, no after taste.</li>
<li> I warm the tube in very hot water, clean and dry the dentures in a dry sink into which I also place the tube so everything gets heated up nicely.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s OK but not any better than other adhesives on the market.</li>
<li> did loosen pretty quickly.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know about wearing for more that 24 hours since I want to brush and clean my mouth and teeth daily anyway.</li>
<li> I have original dentures still thanks to Cushion Grip</li>
<li> I tried all the pastes, waxes, and other gummy goopy products to get comfort OR a good hold.  </li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t last as long as the relining kits but still does a good job and fairly easy to use with no bad taste or smell.</li>
<li> Also, the delivery was right on schedule.  </li>
<li> I would like to know this does not seem right.</li>
<li> In the morning dentures come right out not stuck at all.</li>
<li> It just peels right off in one piece.   </li>
<li> It lasted all of 10 minutes and it peeled right off.  </li>
<li> I do recommend it if you need an adjustment but cant get it done right away</li>
<li> But right now I am wearing temporary dentures, I just got my teeth pulled 6 weeks ago</li>
<li> If I tried to eat with them, the lower denture fell right out.</li>
<li> sure the dentures are clean and free from all residue of any other adhesive</li>
<li> For 3 weeks at a time they fit like they did when I first got them 15 years ago, really, the stuff lasts for up to 3 weeks.</li>
<li> Even with taking them out to clean every day the application lasts not for 4 days but much longer.  </li>
<li> but my upper denture just did not feel nearly as secure as it did when I used either Super Poli-grip or Secure, so</li>
<li> I found that Polident powder was the best in this category of temporary denture adhesives, lasting less than a day.&lt;br /&gt;Before</li>
<li> This product was pretty easy to apply, lasts for weeks with normal use and nightly soaks</li>
<li> far as the product goes, there were so many positive reviews I felt</li>
<li> This product is pure garbage!</li>
<li> This product is a very effective soft liner for dentures that are loose after bone loss.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s great for filling space on ill fitting dentures but not for new one or ones that fit.</li>
<li> Lasts for weeks for this purpose - I still use Secure &#x27;with&#x27; myrrh and aloe vera to hold the denture in place, the regular Secure doesnt work at all. .</li>
<li> I discovered that I apply the cushion grip and about 2 hours later take out dentures and apply light layer of polygrip zinc free and it holds like never before...</li>
<li> your dentures will hold perfectly well, and last easily a few days.&lt;br</li>
<li> your dentures will hold perfectly well, and last easily a few days.&lt;br</li>
<li> I have used the instant smile &amp; &amp;#34;secure smile&amp;#34; cosmetic veneers &amp; hoped this would work better than say polident.</li>
<li> The price was very reasonable.</li>
<li> Product works better than any other product available for dentures.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s more like a layer of putty that molds to your particular soft tissues.</li>
<li> This stuff works great if you need something to get you by until you can afford a hard realign of your dentures.</li>
<li> After reading rave reviews on Cushion Grip, I was excited to try it after getting my new dentures (also a first timer with the dentures).</li>
<li> He rates it higher in comfort and adhesiveness.</li>
<li> I put 1 star because of all the 1 star reviews -I look at those first on products -this</li>
<li> This product does exactly what it says.</li>
<li> I see that denture tabs are at least as cheap at Target, probably cheap at dollar stores--I don&#x27;t know for sure about dollar stores.&lt;br /&gt;--------------------&lt;br</li>
<li> Amazing--the paste adhesive worked even better when it WASN&#x27;T properly</li>
<li> I just now ordered a four-pack to keep on hand when my first order runs out, and I&#x27;m going to continue ordering four-packs</li>
<li> Do exactly what it says in the instructions</li>
<li> You can stiss put regular denture adhesive on top of it, but I don&#x27;t.  </li>
<li> I have been a denture wearer for many years and have religiously used fixodent.</li>
<li> so it is shooting hot air at the dentures and cushion grip</li>
<li> everything has to be hot to work.</li>
<li> be afraid - aggressively apply these products and use them to the maximum and you will be very pleased to see how good they work</li>
<li> I followed the directions exactly</li>
<li> Sure, just because of that reason I listed above about the food.</li>
<li> I have found a different product that I like better</li>
<li> I had to throw it away after the first use......</li>
<li> (Better to go out in public with my denture in than without.)</li>
<li> So I&#x27;m pretty well stuck in the house.&lt;br</li>
<li> First off I would not call this adhesive.</li>
<li> /&gt;It goes,, put a hairdryer and tube of cushion grip in the sink on HOT for 1 minute and it heats up the tube and dentures for easier application.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
<li> Remember to follow the directions exactly</li>
<li> First thing I ate with Cushion Grip? PEANUTS.</li>
<li> I will be purchasing a LOT of this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those trying Cushion Grip for the first time:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
<li> I have relief for the first time in five months.  </li>
<li> Prior to using this I was able to wear my uppers gooped up with adhesive.</li>
<li> next day I made sure that I followed the instructions, again to a &amp;#34;t&amp;#34;.  </li>
<li> Held my father&#x27;s teeth in for a short period of time, then they released their strength on the gums and my dad needed to use more.</li>
<li> but I didn&#x27;t let that bother me and kept my dentures in that night for the first time since I got them.  </li>
<li> Apply to lower denture first.</li>
<li> I threw the remains of that tube away and bought more at the local CVC.  </li>
<li> I made sure to follow the instructions exactly in the next application, and it went on like a dream.  </li>
<li> I can actually wear my top dentures now and even eat with them in.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m glad I only ordered one tube to try it.</li>
<li> For more than ten years,I have tried every type of adhesive, but continued to gag and have the denture slip out.  </li>
<li> I was only 54 when I had to have my top teeth removed.  </li>
<li> I wept the first time I saw myself  without teeth.</li>
<li> It holds pretty well.</li>
<li> I am glad I only purchased one Tube (which by the way went into the Trash Can)</li>
<li> Well, CUSHION grip requires placing tube in hot water for about 5 or so minutes and then applying to dentures.  </li>
<li> I have used Cushion Grip for several years and am generally satisfied with the results.</li>
<li> this stuff feels great but doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like</li>
<li> It serves the same purpose as the product where you pour the liquid into the powder, stir, pour on your dentures, stick them in your mouth, and wait for so many minutes, take them out, and trim away excess -- but this is easier.  </li>
<li> like I had real teeth again!</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t had my first relinment yet.</li>
<li> product works well when tube is first heated in hot water to help the adhesive flow</li>
<li> EXACTLY -</li>
<li> No luck getting it to last more than one day.</li>
<li> seam around the top of tube is starting to bulge ...</li>
<li> maybe that is what they had in mind in the first place?</li>
<li> Time and was exactly as it was described</li>
<li> Product is tricky to use at first but we are learning.</li>
<li> The product doesn&#x27;t hold for more than a short time -</li>
<li> If you wear dentures this is great,food or drink do not wash it away,I have tried others and they have washed away when I drink hot tea.</li>
<li> No, I was very dissatisfied on the price I was charged for product!</li>
<li> It does do exactly what it advertises.</li>
<li> I started using hot water to soften the gel</li>
<li> You are better off using a reline kit or just regular denture adhesive.</li>
<li> Exactly what I wanted, and came sooner than they said.</li>
<li> This was exactly what I wanted.</li>
<li> I recently found one product that worked enough to see me thru one meal, but Cushion Grip is in a league of its own!</li>
<li> and then it burns a bit when you first place your dentures in your mouth after applying it.  </li>
<li> I really do like this denture product!</li>
<li> My husband and my dentures are old and we both need new ones but the cushion grip helps us to be able to keep them in our mouth without them falling out and when we eat it helps to keep seeds and things out from under them.</li>
<li> Very useful product, met my expectations completely...........</li>
<li> Close my mouth till comfortable not tight.  </li>
<li> I have such a problem with my lower denture making sore spots and moving around while I try to eat and this product makes them stay put and is super comfortable.</li>
<li> Great product that is no more !</li>
<li> I am still not convinced this is right for me but having found a much cheaper supply will persevere</li>
<li> If you are having trouble with the pain of mouth sores or loose fitting dentures you will want to give this a try !!!!</li>
<li> This product looked identical in all ways but when I used it it was soft and never hardened like the product I am familiar with.</li>
<li> I honestly can forget I have anything foreign in my mouth.  </li>
<li> It took me a couple times to get it right, but once in, my dentures felt nice and tight and for awhile</li>
<li> the first try, dry plate and apply more over the first layer.    </li>
<li> Even when my family member would smile, eat, and talk, it wouldn&#x27;t be whole heartedly done, because the grip of the dentures weren&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
<li> Since I have to use this product anyway, it&#x27;s much cheaper and way more convenient to order it on line instead of at the local drug store.</li>
<li> I think the positive feed backs are from the manufactor friends or something to make it sell.</li>
<li> have been wearing my new partials for about 6 weeks, give or take a couple of days, and I had several adjustments to make them tolerable enough to eat anything more challenging that soup.</li>
<li> As long as I am satisfied with it, why try anything else?</li>
<li> I eat pretty much what ever I want.  </li>
<li> I used to have to clean and then apply adhesive cream followed with an adhesive powder on top of that just to have them stay for a few hours the start again.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s important to first seat your upper denture in your mouth without Cushion Grip on it.</li>
<li> but once you get the hang of it, it is really easy to use and it works wonders for holding in the bottom plates especially.  </li>
<li> I just got a top denture 4 months ago, and spent the first two months (as the extraction sites healed, swelling reduced, etc.)</li>
<li> complete upper dentures.&lt;br /&gt;The dentures I got look much better than my own teeth for the last 20 years, but trying to enjoy life with them is not easy.&lt;br /&gt;After overcoming a short period of depression, I have tried several products, and I was lucky to find Cushion Grip advertised at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Everything</li>
<li> I&#x27;d force myself to wear the lowers for certain occasions but they were miserable.&lt;br /</li>
<li> If you were smart, you would dump them too.</li>
<li> I guess there is one positive - you don&#x27;t have to scrape it out of your mouth because it absolutely does not stick.</li>
<li> No matter how much you clean it off, moer of it squishes right back out again.</li>
<li> Since I began using Cushion Grip it is like a new world!!</li>
<li> This item was advertised to hold loose fitting in need of realigning dentures.  </li>
<li> I Love this product, I helps my lower dentures stay in place, I still have to use glue but not very much</li>
<li> Recommend this product very highly.</li>
<li> /&gt;the price is very high.</li>
<li> Soak dentures in warm water and you can work the old Cushion Grip loose in one piece.</li>
<li> The taste is strong for a little while but that goes away, some tingle when first put in, but then again goes away quickly</li>
<li> Nice little tube wringer with it.  </li>
<li> I love the way they fit and this was not as hard to use as people made it seem.</li>
<li> is there until you are ready to remove it.</li>
<li> I have always found what I needed at Amazon at reasonable prices.</li>
<li> product adheres very well to dentures.</li>
<li> didn&#x27;t really need this Cushion Grip stuff</li>
<li> but I know that I could go much, much longer if need be.</li>
<li> is fast.</li>
<li> I followed the directions very carfully</li>
<li> Highly recommended!</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t expect a miracle as dentures are an imperfect replacement for the real thing.</li>
<li> I do this and never have a problem the whole day or evening.</li>
<li> I know it doesn&#x27;t seem like much, but when you don&#x27;t have that much coming in to begin with, you want what you buy to deliver.</li>
<li> could not believe how much it burned my gums.</li>
<li> Then I&#x27;m looking for another product or way to reline my denture without dishing out the $550 my dentist wants to charge me.</li>
<li> Have used this for awhile,wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much.</li>
<li> and I try not to clamp my teeth or move my mouth much.</li>
<li> It took awhile to get used to how much to use.</li>
<li> To much</li>
<li> It does harden over time, but it lasts much longer than 4 days.&lt;br</li>
<li> It really does work.  </li>
<li> The only disadvantage is that it isn&#x27;t available in brick and mortar stores.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m talking straight chemicals and it was so gooey</li>
<li> Cushion grip really works.</li>
<li> But Cushion Grip really works and your gums do not be sore.</li>
<li> It didn&#x27;t do anything else I&#x27;d hoped, though, and it is the very devil to scrape off the inside of dentures.  </li>
<li> It worked really well as a cushion</li>
<li> Works very well.</li>
<li> Thanks</li>
<li> This product shapes to the contours of my upper palate and stays secure for days.  </li>
<li> It was very tramatic.</li>
<li> but  price went up cant use it as much as i need to thanks</li>
<li> and I have no complaints that you so much</li>
<li> They ship is fast and at no charge.  </li>
<li> Fast delivery.  </li>
<li> No mixing ,etc., - just  put on your dentures, spread around (I wet the tip of my finger and spread it or push it around would describe it better), and put them in your mouth and go.  </li>
<li> Now my aunt really didn&#x27;t complain of a problem there ethier.</li>
<li> This product worked very well for cushioning and holding my dentures in place.</li>
<li> I have not tried to remove the stuff yet, so cannot really speak to that</li>
<li> Not a scientist, but since vinegar is very acidic, it makes sense to me that it might help soften this stuff up.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
<li> Until you start to eat any thing, then your dentures just start flapping around in your mouth, very diappointed I am.....</li>
<li> This product is not thin and gooey.</li>
<li> Really pricey for what it is and does.  </li>
<li> I expected much more.  </li>
<li> TO WORK WITH TO APPLY TO DENTURES AND VERY PRICEY FOR THE PRODUCT.</li>
<li> I cant afford to pay 62.00 nor 248.00 thanks fir nothing</li>
<li> I think  everyone that tries it would like or love it.</li>
<li> Thank you so much.</li>
<li> I also appreciated my fellow Amazonians answering my questions.&lt;br /&gt;Christine Schulz</li>
<li> Really Really like it.</li>
<li> THEY ARE LOSING SOOOO MUCH</li>
<li> Much better than I expected,</li>
<li> Thanks.</li>
<li> Very embarassing.</li>
<li> The dentures feel SO secure, and I even ate some thick slices of roast beef for lunch and was able to chew it without the dentures moving even a millimeter.  </li>
<li> But I&#x27;m going to keep giving it a fair chance, at least, until I run out of it.until</li>
<li> I am quite handy as I have modified quite a few pair of the teeth to appear as real teeth.</li>
<li> someone has had success with this along with the *modified* instant smile type cosmetic teeth, please write a review.&lt;br /&gt;Polident, polident strips along w the powder is the way to go w these</li>
<li> WOW!!!</li>
<li> I actually ate comfortabley tonight for the first time in 6 weeks of having my teeth pulled!!</li>
<li> but I don&#x27;t think it is any better than any other product like this.</li>
<li> Cushion Grip is WAY BETTER than all the other denture adhesives.</li>
<li> Much better than any other product I have tried.</li>
<li> I had tried many products and this one worked extremely well.  </li>
<li> Not only does it take 15 minutes to follow the steps properly, but the first time that I put anything into my mouth to chew both top and bottom fell out.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t work any better than any other adhesive.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s ok but not what I expected to me this is priced way to high for what it is</li>
<li> For those Older denture users who have lower dentures, this product is very helpful for you .</li>
<li> You can actually take them out and clean them and the paste stays unless you peel it off .</li>
<li> Again holds my dentures securely, no gunk to remove after you take them out and evens allows you to use denture soak, &amp; no nasty taste or no mint taste that makes everything taste minty;)</li>
<li> Cushion Grip is a top reviewed product on several sights, but I did not see any references to people using it on anything other than full</li>
<li> I recently had a full lower plate done over the summer.  </li>
<li> Arrived early, exactly as described.</li>
<li> Good product,too expensive to reorder more later.</li>
<li> Be aware that the product will not adhere to a denture that already has a soft liner.</li>
<li> If this isn&#x27;t some massive price gouging, a $7 + tube of cushion grip you could get at CVS going for $20 good luck with that little venture</li>
<li> I thought the shipping was a little much, but aside from that okay.</li>
<li> This denture was nearly new!  </li>
<li> I could not have remediated these issues with this product, and it does &amp;#34;ooze&amp;#34; to fit (although you can&#x27;t feel it), and I would have been very concerned about the suction pulling out my plugs in the new extraction sights, causing dry socket, if I had tried to use it to soon.&lt;br</li>
<li> I paid more for this one tube, $21.44, than I did for 4 tubes previously.  </li>
<li> After using Cushion Grip for more than 5 years at less than $ 7.00 for a one Oz.</li>
<li> I bought this for my husband, he used it and said that it didn&#x27;t hold his bottom denture in AT ALL and that only held his top denture in for a short time, maybe 8 hours.  </li>
<li> Does not last more than regular adhesives.   </li>
<li> Today I tried the Comfort Grip for the first time, not really believing that all the hype could be true.  </li>
<li> For a quick fix that lasts I would definitely recommend this.</li>
<li> so it&#x27;s more difficult to get a power supply connection to fit it!</li>
<li> Surprised to read all the positive reviews.  </li>
<li> Better than strips, gooey mess, or powder.</li>
<li> I love not having to scrape that gooey mess off the roof of my mouth...</li>
<li> Very hard to remove from dentures the hold wasnt good.</li>
<li> I will highly recommend it to every body how wears dentures.</li>
<li> purchased two tubes in 2013 for 14.99 this one tube cost $29.00 with 6.99 for shipping...very high price????</li>
<li> just takes a little more time than squirting cream and going.</li>
<li> Ten times higher!</li>
<li> This time I put just a little bit more of the stuff in the groove of the lower plate.  </li>
<li> Wow tho this product made me forget I am wearing dentures and my pallet is not hurting either!!</li>
<li> I waited patiently, although the delivery did take a little more than I had thought and it arrived 2 days ago.  </li>
<li> I wish it would be a little more like the color of the dentures.</li>
<li> It is worth a try, especially if you&#x27;re early in recovering and shrinking fast.</li>
<li> , I am hoping it sets up, as they were quite comfortable and stayed in place quite well - but the burning gums were completely alarming.</li>
<li> My partial has never been so secure.</li>
<li> expensive but in great time</li>
<li> Clean your dentures, dry them well and apply Cushion Grip according to instructions.  </li>
<li> The lower plate must be thoroughly clean and dry.</li>
<li> Plate must be thoroughly clean and dry.</li>
<li> was a great product, but it&#x27;s way too expensive now.</li>
<li> I think this product could possibly be useful if your dentures were way too big</li>
<li> Now I think I am going to be able to use Cushion Grip without any trouble.  </li>
<li> in all, the ease of use of EFFERGRIP makes it the top choice, in my humble opinion.</li>
<li> for instant smile need to be modified teeth...</li>
<li> for instant smile need to be modified teeth...</li>
<li> I can see it being perhaps useful in &amp;#34;fine-tuning&amp;#34; a temporary reline kit, but DON&#x27;T confuse it with actual denture adhesive.</li>
<li> Just smooth it out, bite down gently, let set up</li>
<li> this product is the only thing that works on dentures that need more &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; ... my dentures have never fit quite right</li>
<li> It is not hard at all</li>
<li> physical appearance and my new smile go hand and</li>
<li> By following the directions, it goes on easily and will last up to 4 days before you remove it.</li>
<li> Once I left off the pressure, it stopped burning right away.</li>
<li> (2) it is sticky messy but despite the cons I continue to buy and use it because the pros out weigh the cons especially having fitting dentures!</li>
<li> I tried it and it doesn&#x27;t hold anything in place but sure does make a mess!</li>
<li> Just pop them in warm water and put them back in without another application which makes the product last long.</li>
<li> I live in Dexter Maine, I have checked all the stores and pharmacies and could not find the denture adhesive \\&quot;Cushion Grip\\&quot;.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a fairly new denture wearer, and I&#x27;ve had no luck at all with the adhesives I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
<li> Then they would send me a new tube.</li>
<li> Just did a new application.</li>
<li> Perhaps I&#x27;ll give it another shot when I get new dentures, but for now its not on my list of things to buy.</li>
<li> IN NEED OF A NEW LINER AND CAN&#x27;T AFFORD ONE</li>
<li> New to using dentures.</li>
<li> MY plate was new</li>
<li> so you don&#x27;t have a problem thanks to you I want be able to eat nuts or any hard produce</li>
<li> but if you warm your dentures in very hot water for a few minutes, it will peel off with a little effort.  </li>
<li> Less bulk &amp; more cushion than a professional soft reline.</li>
<li> It holds the teeth securely in place, and is so comfortable, you forget you are wearing false teeth.</li>
<li> Cushin Grip stays inplace and is very soft and shapes to your jaw.</li>
<li> Now,I&lt;br /&gt;can go about my busy day with a high degree of self-esteem .My</li>
<li> /&gt;It is simple and easy to apply as long as the directions are followed.  </li>
<li> I only wish the color was more pink like gums or clear.</li>
<li> Not only was it HOT</li>
<li> I use a small amount of powder adhesive as well for a gripping fit.&lt;br /&gt;Roy Thornton</li>
<li> but it does actually grip pretty well.  </li>
<li> The instructions say to soak the tube in hot tap water for five minutes, and a key is supplied to put on the end of the tube to help you get the product out of the tube.</li>
<li> IF YOUR GOING THROUGH YOUR EXTRACTIONS AND SOFT LINERS, THIS PRODUCT WILL HELP TO FIT YOUR DENTURES BETWEEN SOFT LINERS, AND KEEP THEM FROM SLIPPING AROUND AND RUBBING SORE SPOTS ON YOUR GUMS.</li>
<li> the product was great, what is wrong is taking advantage of people that really need this by charging double the amount.</li>
<li> I have used cushion grip for years, not sure why they removed it from the stores but glad I can still get it online.</li>
<li> this product does exactly what it says it does and if used correctly, will last even longer than it boast...</li>
<li> Ok, so really I have had problems with my lower partial ever since I had a preemptive extraction on what was an anchor tooth for my bottom partial denture.  </li>
<li> i have a full upper and a partial lower and due to unusual circumstances, i cannot bear down evenly to get a good seal.</li>
<li> Works fine but just doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
<li> I bit down to get a secure seal</li>
<li> Is it good, yes, BUT the price is way above what is called gouging, it is ridiculous.  </li>
<li> If followed as directed it works well and is easy to remove, it&#x27;s not a bit messy</li>
<li> Not sure what changed, probably my mouth - but it is no longer holding for more than 6 hours before it completely lets go.</li>
<li> Soak plates in hot (not boiling) water for ten minutes to soften old Cushion Grip application.</li>
<li> but my dentures have remained tightly seated and comfortable all day.</li>
<li> It certainly didn&#x27;t last the 4 days as promised.  </li>
<li> Well, when I got to work, I was on the telephone talking and felt that I could not talk right because the lower plate was once again loose.  </li>
<li> I read so many reports about it being hard to use.  </li>
<li> you can hardly get it for 18.00 a tube, most are over $20.  </li>
<li> I creates a nice, secure suction to the upper palate and gums without the need for messy, hard to remove adhesives.  </li>
<li> I would like to clear something up for those who are dissappointed with the product.</li>
<li> so I could get a clear understanding of how to get the optimal use.  </li>
<li> CushionGrip made it possible for him to wear partial comfortably.</li>
<li> Although a bit pricey, at his stage in life; comfort has a value which is sometimes not cost sensitive.</li>
<li> Amazon can&#x27;t be beat as far as I am concerned.</li>
<li> and she can&#x27;t afford to get them fixed.</li>
<li> Wow.</li>
<li> They feel so snug and soft, with no adhesive.</li>
<li> I got this product for a 95 year old young lady who says nothing else will keep her dentures in place.  </li>
<li> I still have to use a bit of adhesive as this is not an adhesive but a soft pliable cushion liner.  </li>
<li> My dentures would \\&quot;rock back and forth\\&quot; on the top and the partial just simply popped up.  </li>
<li> Being retired and on a fixed income, this helps a lot.</li>
<li> Perhaps I don&#x27;t want to find out because this is the only thing that helps me as much as it does.</li>
<li> I couldn&#x27;t throw away the tube of CG fast enough!    </li>
<li> Since I&#x27;m on a fixed income, and my husband is unemployed, we try to keep our expenses low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Then it didn&#x27;t burn, but it didn&#x27;t adhere completely either.</li>
<li> They promised me I would receive a labeled package to send the old tube in.</li>
<li> At least, it is ok while I&#x27;m not eating.</li>
<li> It lasts much longer than stated on the package and does not have to be removed and replaced daily (as adhesives do.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> If product overflowed above denture I gently trim it.</li>
<li> The only thing is that it cost a bit much.</li>
<li> It is not an adhesive but rather a soft liner for your dentures.  </li>
<li> Do not waste your money on this one.</li>
<li> It felt like I had a liquefying gummy worm candy in my dentures after several hours...and, much to my surprise, the stuff came off in a gooey mass.  </li>
<li> THIS IS BY FAR</li>
<li> Until it completely sets, some of it will ooze over the edges.</li>
<li> As far as its performance, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
<li> WOW, what a difference.</li>
<li> Do not waste your money or time ordering it.</li>
<li> and they even stay in , so far it&#x27;s been four day that they stay in</li>
<li> It is soft and pliable.</li>
<li> It worked very well but it is only a temporary fix</li>
<li> the same cushion.&lt;br /&gt;The price was to much for it..</li>
<li> It really does last 4-5 days!!</li>
<li> It leaves a soft layer between your gums and your denture, eliminating the &amp;#34;sucky feeling&amp;#34;</li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
<li> Ordered this for my 85 year old father.</li>
<li> it is a pain to apply but it is the only thing that works for more than a few minutes</li>
<li> I REPIT THE COMENT FROM BIG G OF SEPTEMBER 28,2011.WHY TO WASTE MORE TIME FOR THIS JUNK.THEY</li>
<li> I really don&#x27;t think it is worth all that trouble.</li>
<li> By adding extra Cushion Grip, I was able to balance this trouble spot and stabilize my bite.</li>
<li> This stuff does not hold dentures, and is a mess to clean off dentures.</li>
<li> Who can get most foods into her mouth in just that small amount of space!</li>
<li> I even tried letting the cream air out on my dentures--it&#x27;s an effort, just getting the cream out of the tube--hoping that exposure to air might mean better results, but that didn&#x27;t work either.</li>
<li> It does take a little effort to clean the old liner material from your dentures</li>
<li> It just peels right off the partial denture.  </li>
<li> I had to make a few adjustments to account for high and low spots on my plates, but overall, I am extremely pleased.</li>
<li> I goofed and didn&#x27;t dry my dentures first.</li>
<li> Easy to apply and the with the small tool.</li>
<li> I used way to much the first time and had a mess.  </li>
<li> Dentures remain in all day and absolutely no mess when you take them out.</li>
<li> Broke loose on the first bite.  </li>
<li> but I think overall I have found a product that really allows me to finally eat like a normal human and feel almost normal again.</li>
<li> the tube had a different label and when I first used it , there was a big bubble , so</li>
<li> Since the directions were for full plates, I reduced the amount used by a little on the bottom and a lot on</li>
<li> Highly recommend the entire process.</li>
<li> Exactly what was expected.</li>
<li> : If you want your temporary &amp;#34;costume&amp;#34; well modified teeth to work and look great, stick with any denture product which has the ability to both hold &#x27;em and harden (polident used w the powder not exposed to heat constantly will do this).&lt;br /&gt;Buying this product, at least for me and the folks I have helped was a waste of time and money.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
<li> I tried to use at first worked only for a few hours, even after doing a soft reline on my denture, which was very helpful.</li>
<li> (I use Reline-It as a replacement for hard re-lines, but many similar products are sold.)</li>
<li> My husband tried this product following all directions to perfection and it didn&#x27;t hold worth nothing on four or five tries.  </li>
<li> This is an excellent product and I am appalled that I could not find it locally -</li>
<li> The bond is very secure and tough.  </li>
<li> I take them out daily to clean and after a few days they feel slightly not as tight</li>
<li> My experience generally with Amazon is outstanding, but this one really sucks big time.</li>
<li> You don&#x27;t need no other.</li>
<li> I only have a cover so this may be different for full or partial dentures but for my cover purposes this tasted funky and wouldn&#x27;t stay put until I pressed for awhile</li>
<li> Had to use twice as much as what instructions specified, but may be because my dentures were extremely loose.  </li>
<li> My dentures were so loose and using so much denture adhesive to keep them in.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m somewhat new to wearing dentures, so I have been busy trying just about every way to secure my dentures in place, and out of all of the things I&#x27;ve tried, Cushion Grip was the biggest failure!  </li>
<li> Firstly the price of this product is outragous!, while I am partially to blame for not researching beforehand, I paid $22.95 Amazon Prime and then discovered the same product in a local CVS for $7.99, some markup!&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
<li> Everyone&#x27;s dentures wear down and so do the gums, but with Cushion Grip you can make the dentures fit tight again and delay having to have new dentures made.  </li>
<li> I am disappointed that it isn&#x27;t available any more.</li>
<li> BUT you shouldn&#x27;t use to completely avoid regular yearly checkups and adjustments.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
<li> It is my go-to product as a home replacement for a soft reline and is the only product of its type that I have found anywhere.</li>
<li> (had several professional relines/used home kits, etc.</li>
<li> Why you are seeing the price hike is because when it is sold out it is gone sort of like the old supply and demand, The only thing I can think to do is to contact Bayer AG to encourage them to once again manufacture Cushion Grip.</li>
<li> Went back to my old brand.  </li>
<li> This denture thermoplastic, can be used by everyone,its like a soft reliner for your dentures last about 4weeks</li>
<li> /&gt;But overall, the pros completely outweigh the cons.</li>
<li> Product did not hold dentures in place even when following the directions completely as required.</li>
<li> AGAIN IT IS WORTH ANY TROUBLE</li>
<li> Also, for the first day or two after a new application, I have to trim off excess that has squeezed out the sides or back of the denture, and that is a little bothersome.&lt;br</li>
<li> I was very hesitant to try due to some of the reviews which made is sound so hard to do.  </li>
<li> /&gt;You only need to put a small amount of renew in your denture bath and it will last easily two weeks to a month.</li>
<li> It isn&#x27;t as  easy to use as I had first thought, but it does hold, I&#x27;m just to big of a hurry, Time line sometimes makes it difficult to use.</li>
<li> IF YOU HAVE ILL FITTING DENTURES, OR YOU ARE A NEW DENTURE WEARER, THIS PRODUCT WILL BE SO HELPFUL TO YOU.</li>
<li> This product is so comfortable you will be wondering why this is not available everywhere!!</li>
<li> I have had 2 sets of dentures and they both have not fit right.  </li>
<li> Managing to find the &#x27;right&#x27; amount to use is a challenge, the recommended amount oozes everywhere</li>
<li> First, it took me half an hour to set it all up and get the dentures in my mouth.  </li>
<li> The BAD -its been discontinued probably by dental lobbyists because its a great alternative to going back in for relines.</li>
<li> It will last at least 4 days and makes my dentures so secure, I can even sleep in them with no problem.  </li>
<li> If one is too old or cannot afford to consider multiple tooth implants, one&#x27;s only solution is to wear dentures.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
<li> I bought this item and found it was not at all applicable to the cosmetic teeth, maybe because they are thin when fixed to fit</li>
<li> and I had to leave it in the hot tap water a little longer for it to be manageable.</li>
<li> but...if your dentures are loose particularly if you have very little gum left (bottom plate for me...this stuff is worth the difficulty.  </li>
<li> One is expected to dry the dentures first.</li>
<li> Not long ago AT ALL, I could buy it at C.V.S. drugstores for about $7.00 or $8.00.</li>
<li> You have been warned by someone who has tried it, followed directions exactly, and wishes I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money-</li>
<li> i have gone into serious anxiety over this as i cannot believe that after 5 yrs of suffering i finally found a miracle product that is no longer available.</li>
<li> Be sure to cover entire back edge of upper plate with a thin layer of Cushion Grip.</li>
<li> You must be careful removing the cushion grip to put new strip in so as not to drop or damage dentures.</li>
<li> I tried the typical gooey adhesive,the power and thought I would try this since the reviews sounded like it really works.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m new to dentures and have used the pastes that are very gooey and hard to remove when you take dentures out.</li>
<li> That time, I had left it in for 20 minutes, pressing down the whole time as another reviewer suggested.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s as if you&#x27;re getting a new soft liner every few days.</li>
<li> and if it is a tight space on the lower denture, get a thin strong piece of wood or something that will fit into the tight spaces and really press the material firmly on the denture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I bought this product and found it very comfortable, but extremely difficult to remove from my dentures.  </li>
<li> There isn&#x27;t anything worse than loose fitting dentures and adhesive that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
<li> After the second day, I sometimes have to supplement it with a little conventional adhesive, but even then I get a much better hold than with the conventional adhesive alone.</li>
<li> The little tube does not seem to go far with frequent applications to 2 plates.  </li>
<li> but many times I do it wrong, too much or too little and have to scrap it all off and start over.</li>
<li> I had high hopes for this one and it let me down.</li>
<li> My denture seemed to be firm enough, at first, but shortly afterwards, it became loose again.&lt;br</li>
<li> I discovered that it really is not an adhesive to hold the dentures to your gums (obviously this is why you can clean them and soak them for at least 4 days).</li>
<li> Just use plain old Fixodent!!!</li>
<li> If I had had to scrape that horrible, rubbery Polident off my gums one more time, I was going to just give up!!!  </li>
<li> I have completely abandoned all other forms of adhesives.</li>
<li> Ok, so not really understanding the concept of cushion grip, since it is not really an adhesive...but having read all the positive reviews, and being desperate, I bought a tube on amazon.  </li>
<li> Second, it sticks very tenaciously to your dentures, but there is very little adhesion to the gums.</li>
<li> I have bought this product several times in the past at REASONABLE prices.  </li>
<li> , I think It is the same thing same color and texture, didn&#x27;t hold long  </li>
<li> No other adhesive used and no pain, slipping or wobbling.</li>
<li> They were hard to get used to at first</li>
<li> I let cushion grip dry on dentures overnight &amp; the same thing happened the next day.</li>
<li> and no more worries about zinc and having to use denture creams that don&#x27;t really hold.</li>
<li> Apparently,  it is no longer being produced.</li>
<li> And it doesn&#x27;t last as long as others reviews said</li>
<li> I find it last a long time on the denture even with drinking or eating, as some paste wash away when drinking</li>
<li> The strength of this product is truly amazing.&lt;br /&gt;After eight to ten long hours of work,shopping and relaxation,Cushion Grip still maintains a strong,reliable grip.</li>
<li> I couldn&#x27;t see going several days without my lower partial just to get another denture made with potentially the same</li>
<li> When compared to another brand I have using until recently, this grip lasts twice as long.</li>
<li> After reading all, and I mean ALL, the reviews I was super excited to try but after 5 failed attempt I give up.</li>
<li> hard to find, paid way too much for this but only thing that helps my dad when he gets a sore under his dentures.</li>
<li> Tried several other OTC adhesives, this one beats them all short of lab-quality reliner such as those from Perma-Soft.</li>
<li> Speaking of cracks, something else I am not happy about is, if I use Cushion Grip longer than five or six days, it becomes dry and starts peeling, even if I soak clean it.</li>
<li> Just so you know, when you first put it in your mouth you have to hold it in a while and for the first like 5 minutes it burns like crazy.</li>
<li> and that they really last a long long time.</li>
<li> Consider the use of Cushion Grip, as a soft reline, lasting a few days, in contrast with the soft reline with Prosoft, which may last a few months.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
<li> but I only have an upper partial.  </li>
<li> /&gt;After being told that we could make no further adjustments on my lower partial without sending it back to the lab, I got online and started researching.</li>
<li> My review is limited at this time, I haven&#x27;t actually used the product yet.</li>
<li> This the only thing that works for my loose dentures.</li>
<li> You take them out wash and put back in with your reg adhesive for four or five days till the Cushion Grip starts coming loose.  </li>
<li> I would only recommend for people that have really loose dentures as a temp fix.  </li>
<li> Not came loose - actually fell out.  </li>
<li> The state of one&#x27;s gums is constantly changing, shrinking, so that a reline and adjustment of the dentures has to be done by your dentist as needed, when the dentures get loose.</li>
<li> Eating has been hard, and I havebeen staying away from certain foods.  </li>
<li> Was really surprised at the tight fight of this product.</li>
<li> /&gt;One time, I didn&#x27;t bite down as hard, and I took my denture out right away, waited for five minutes, then put it back in my mouth, as the instruction sheet directed.</li>
<li> I read all the other reviews after this experience, and it seems only 1 or 2 people have had a similar experience.</li>
<li> \\&quot;Cushion Grip\\&quot; is a paste that is formulated to hold loose dentures in place for a long time - several days in fact (not that it is recommended to keep a denture in for days on end!).  </li>
<li> and it goes a long way.</li>
<li> I drove to 5 different stores covering over 150 miles and spent over 4 hours looking for this product for a family member who swears by it and won&#x27;t settle for anything else.  </li>
<li> but I will need another one before  too long.  </li>
<li> /&gt;The inside of my denture is rough so Cushion Grip clings tenaciously, especially in the front and takes a lot of time and patience to remove.</li>
<li> denture is very loose &amp; causes constant pain.</li>
<li> This was a complete waste of my money.</li>
<li> so I just order from Amazon &amp; it doesn&#x27;t take long at all to get your order.</li>
<li> Turn key carefully squeezing out a ball of Cushion Grip 3/4 inch in diameter.    </li>
<li> I have shared this item with friends, and they have the same problem, dentures slipping.  </li>
<li> When this product warms up from the natural body temperature inside the mouth it softens &amp; oozes out all along the edges of my dentures.</li>
<li> I will keep using this product as long as I need to.</li>
<li> With time, things will improve, as your gums get harder, and you learn how to use the various adhesives, so</li>
<li> For the past 2 days I have been eating normally without using the adhesive gunk on my denture.  </li>
<li> B T W, I applied it toboth sides of my partial (2 teeth on the side with an anchor and only one on the side where I lost the anchor tooth).</li>
<li> I have partial plates, both upper and lower.</li>
<li> My partial does not sit properly in that area because there is almost no support.</li>
<li> Remember the stuff goes a long way</li>
<li> Didn&amp;#34;t last as long as I expected.</li>
<li> it cost 17 or more for one so not happy but deal because the stores don&#x27;t selk no more.</li>
<li> That&#x27;s not really a good analogy because your frying pan has a flat surface while your dentures are full of little ridges and depressions.     </li>
<li> I just felt I should know how other products, such as this one, perform.</li>
<li> Please read the other reviews, as I did, to use the proper application technique.</li>
<li> Cushion Grip stands head and shoulders above any other denture adhesive.</li>
<li> It was hard to work with and it became a complete and utter mess.&lt;br /&gt;Trying to remove it</li>
<li> VERY HARD TO USE(HAVE TO USE HOT WATER @</li>
<li> (3) is a pain to remove it when it is time to come off (4) also takes time to dry once you put it on the dentures (</li>
<li> one downside, it seems to me, with this product, is that you&#x27;re supposed to apply it to DRY dentures.</li>
<li> the denture (or dentures - upper/lower) in a dry bathroom sink.</li>
<li> would suggest that you Remember to DRY the tube so your fingers aren&#x27;t damp.</li>
<li> Wish I&#x27;d realized that this seller would let you buy single tubes.</li>
<li> I watched video after video on youtube, read every single review and have done it EXACRLY like I was suppose to</li>
<li> I have had my dentures for a little over one year and was so sorry that I had agreed to have the remaining top teeth pulled and a partial on the bottom.  </li>
<li> Given that I have rheumatoid arthritis and some pretty severe nerve damage in my hands, this prep work was harder on me than average, but had the stuff at least worked well</li>
<li> It does get a lot harder as it gets older and somewhat hard to remove.  </li>
<li> You still must use adhesives if you do not dentures will still be loose.</li>
<li> Then it turns loose.</li>
<li> I felt the lowers loose.  </li>
<li> (They were that loose).  </li>
<li> Then you put it in place in your mouth and bite down firmly enough to get it to set to your mouth.</li>
<li> Anyone who buys the cosmetic teeth needs to modify them by removing the plate thing from the back &amp; grinding them down till they r almost see through.</li>
<li> but it doesn&#x27;t last very long for me and polygrip is a mess.</li>
<li> Tried a second time, just in case, with less product on the plate.</li>
<li> Complete the seal by biting down firmly.     </li>
<li> As it cools off, it gets less sticky and then you can really press it hard onto the surface.&lt;br</li>
<li> This is simply not true at all as I have extensively used Renew</li>
<li> i made a mess of it because i did not know how to use it the directions on the box are not enough</li>
<li> I was so disappointed when Cushion Grip lifted right out without any real effort on my part.</li>
<li> After about 3 weeks I developed small sharp protrusions on my dentures where I believe this was penetrating them.  </li>
<li> It works a described and you may have to still use a little bit of another daily use type of adhesive with it.</li>
<li> The word \\&quot;comfort\\&quot; in the name of this product really does mean COMFORT!  </li>
<li> The final feel is something like a hard wax against the gums (though it is not nearly as fragile as wax.)  </li>
<li> The cushion grip definitely made them tighter and I could even eat foods that I was having a hard time with just regular denture adhesive.  </li>
<li> the hot water bath did not soften it, what comes out is very hard to manipulate dry, firm glue-like substance.</li>
<li> Too bad so many retail stores no longer carry it.</li>
<li> The product is great but the price is outrageous !</li>
<li> I was tired of my denture cream liquefying on me, and replacing the cream at least twice a day to keep my dentures comfortable.  </li>
<li> This sounded so promising that I was really hopeful, but this is the absolute worst denture adhesive product on the market (and I&#x27;ve tried them all).  </li>
<li> Great Product, hate that it is discontinued!</li>
<li> Not much you can say about cushion grip adhesive except it works or it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
<li> Did not work as expected for being recommended</li>
<li> /&gt;So--powder is expected to be dusted over wet dentures.</li>
<li> This stuff is not really an adhesive like polygrip...</li>
<li> and that it does not work with partial dentures with metal.</li>
<li> This purchase was made out of desperation to save my partial.</li>
<li> read instructions carefully.</li>
<li> This product was what I expected.</li>
<li> Total waste of time and money.</li>
<li> Did not hold as well as I expected.  </li>
<li> She had used it before (loves it) but was having trouble finding it in our local pharmacies.</li>
<li> one of which supported his partial.</li>
<li> not much help.  </li>
<li> product does not hold my lower partial denture at all, let alone holding it up</li>
<li> Just wanted to weigh in for those of us who wear partial dentures.&lt;br</li>
<li> Not quite the value I expected for the price.</li>
<li> I can not really tell anyone else to try this.</li>
<li> For the zillion frustrating, tiny bits of residue, I use an alcohol-soaked soft toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Package was damaged, taste is so disgusting and is a mess when trying to clean dentures, I also noticed it burn your gums when trying to fit.</li>
<li> I can recommend that you don&#x27;t wrap them in a towel with the hair dryer; it&#x27;s disastrous, but it does peel off easily when it cools down enough to touch.  </li>
<li> I would highly recommend this to anyone using a grip to hold loose false teeth in.</li>
<li> my quest goes on...hoped third time using was going to be the charm...lasted half way through breakfast this time, shorter than previous attempts.  </li>
<li> a little seems to go a long way.  </li>
<li> Very very sad &amp; disgusting for customers with sensitive gums &amp; ill fitting dentures being forced to pay the &amp;#34;price&amp;#34; to be able to eat, until they can get something else done!!!!!!</li>
<li> though I&#x27;d give it a try after reading other reviews.</li>
<li> is inplants to hole the lower denture in place without adhesives or other like items.  </li>
<li> At one time Walmart and other stores were selling it.</li>
<li> apply what seems like a SMALL amount for the initial mold.</li>
<li> Also, you can feel edges if you don&#x27;t trim perfectly.ems like a SMALL amount for the initial mold.</li>
<li> It is difficult to remove--just keep soaking in hot water</li>
<li> Isn&#x27;t there some type of due diligence conducted on products?  </li>
<li> Other people like it, but</li>
<li> I am going to spend my endless days complaining on google, Amazon and Ebay for what they have done.</li>
<li> First, it is difficult to apply.</li>
<li> That makes it pretty expensive even if it worked.</li>
<li> (I did still have an anchor tooth on the other side of my mouth).</li>
<li> /&gt;It is much worse than the normal denture adhesive I have been using.&lt;br</li>
<li> First it is quite difficult to get out of the tube</li>
<li> It is hard to work with, even when following the directions carefully.</li>
<li> I have tried other products but they were horrible, especially the kind you have to pre mix yourself.</li>
<li> The taste is a little annoying at first, and it doesn&#x27;t really have any grip, but the cushion is the reason I keep buying Cushion Grip.</li>
<li> /&gt;Application to the denture was not all that difficult, I did apply too much initially, just takes a tiny bit and that goes a long way.</li>
<li> The other products slipped into my mouth and down my throat.  </li>
<li> Using conventional adhesive, I had to re-apply before and after each meal, and sometimes even during the meal.  </li>
<li> Fixodent works great in all forms but the taste is terrible and makes my stomach feel raw.</li>
<li> The dentures rocked a little and on the third day when I bit on something firm my denture broke in two!  </li>
<li> the dark.</li>
<li> Since this product already is rated at an average of 4 stars, I&#x27;m not throwing off</li>
<li> it sit there for at least ten minutes.</li>
<li> /&gt;This will last for at least one month like this.</li>
<li> a small ball goes a long way.</li>
<li> Not worth the money.</li>
<li> Not worth the cost to ship it.</li>
<li> My upper plate did not particularly need the extra layer of cushioning, but I added a very thin layer there as well, and</li>
<li> but I highly recommend this product to anyone with a loose and/or painful upper denture.</li>
<li> but Im thinking dentist greed shut down production of this product.</li>
<li> Beets using glue hands down.</li>
<li> It takes you a couple of times to get the procedure down</li>
<li> Is there any way the price can come down some.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
<li> After calming down a bit, I decided maybe it was something I over looked.  </li>
<li> that song come down to me</li>
<li> I thought C G would do it, thats money down the drain.  </li>
<li> It can be molded, but it&#x27;s a little too hard to mold to the gums well enough.</li>
<li> and I think I hadn&#x27;t actually been able to use the awful things to bite before this.</li>
<li> what who is buying this at these prices , but i wouldnt unless lost half of my brains cells</li>
<li> and it held for less than 5 minutes.</li>
<li> it used to be (just 6 months ago) around $8.00 for a tube at the drug store, and sometimes less on Amazon.</li>
<li> It seems to have a slightly glue-like consistency.</li>
<li> Some of my issues had to do with the denture being too tight, and with having a protrusion that needed to be smoothed down.</li>
<li> too bad they took it off the market and now the few tubes left cost a whole weeks salary</li>
<li> had trouble with removing and cleaning off teeth Not worth returning.still in my med cabinet.might</li>
<li> This product is NOT the sticky, gooey mess that adheres to gums to hold teeth in place.  </li>
<li> It feels funny in my mouth, and it made my face numb for about a minute when I used it.</li>
<li> It creates a tight seal with suction.</li>
<li> Disliked the taste, and it did not work for me, I tried several times, thin, thick, layers back to poligrip</li>
<li> I wasted almost half a tube before I knew what I was doing though.  </li>
<li> But it is too little amount for the price.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little over priced</li>
<li> but it is a little expensive/ tell me something in 2014</li>
<li> Even after 18 hours it is still a little bit of a chore to remove them from my mouth</li>
<li> I have been using this product for years, it&#x27;s a little work applying and removing</li>
<li> and yes it did burn just a little bit</li>
<li> and I do use just a little poligrip adhesive at the roof of my mouth for that added security they will stay put</li>
<li> When I tried cutting the excess off, the whole application came out with one slight tug.</li>
<li> Use as little Cushion Grip as necessary, by squeezing the pea size glue into thin rope like shape, which you will lay to the denture as per drawing.&lt;br</li>
<li> I use this cushion grip as a supplement when I plan on doing some heavy eating.</li>
<li> If you need to get by for a few weeks or few months</li>
<li> Press the material firmly</li>
<li> IMHO, this stuff is a waste of money and time.</li>
<li> and I did have to mold them a few times</li>
<li> it was a waste of my money</li>
<li> Then I can&#x27;t even wear my denture for a few days, until it heals again.</li>
<li> don&#x27;t like giving negative reviews, but in this case, I am seriously not very happywith this product.</li>
<li> Took it home and tried it and had trouble</li>
<li> Spread ball with fingers until entire groove is covered with a thin, even layer of Cushion Grip.</li>
<li> Press layer firmly to plate.</li>
<li> Then put in lower denture and bite firmly.    </li>
<li> Press layer firmly to plate.</li>
<li> Then, with thumb push up firmly to roof of mouth.</li>
<li> about a month ago I&#x27;m 23 by the way and have been having so much trouble keeping my bottoms in.</li>
<li> Dont waste your money please...</li>
<li> Thirdly, and this is the worse part, removing it from your dentures.</li>
<li> When it does set, its texture is sort of like a firm yet pliable rubber.  </li>
<li> My son told me about this a few years ago.</li>
<li> It took me a few times to get5 everything applied correctly but</li>
<li> I brush the teeth everyday and soak them once a week and Cushion Grip keeps on working.</li>
<li> Also,a tip-put dab in dentures,heat with blow dryer a few seconds, then mold .</li>
<li> I do not hate the product I hate the price and will not buy this again from Amazon</li>
<li> He almost had a kitten when we had trouble finding it in FL though it has gotten worse over the last few years to find it.  </li>
<li> They ooze and disappear with in just a few hours.</li>
<li> this tutorial, I would like to add a few points which may be helpful to you.&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
<li> and it was just a waste of my money as i gave it to the neighbor that suggested i buy it</li>
<li> MEASURE TEMP, EVERY BODY HAS A THERMOMETER)&lt;br /&gt;VERY MESSY AND TIME</li>
<li> Not having to deal with that adhesive every day is a blessing, as is the fact that I don&#x27;t seem to be having trouble eating.  </li>
<li> Holds teeth firmly in place while eating.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
<li> I have used this product for a few years and it works</li>
<li> , both dentures secured themselves tightly and every sore spot was gone!  </li>
<li> I left it in for a few days and it was VERY hard to remove!</li>
<li> I had sore spots on my gums that just got worse each time I put my dentures in and tried to eat anything, a pinching on the back end of the top palate every time I swallowed, and a shifting and loosening of the bottom denture (even when \\&quot;secured\\&quot; with that goopy awful Polident)</li>
<li> they would rock and make raw spots on the inside of my gum .</li>
<li> Having a little between the hard plastic</li>
<li> Very,very hard to clean your dentures after you apply this crap on them.</li>
<li> It provides cushion but very little grip.  </li>
<li> Waste of my hard earned money.</li>
<li> you have to use excessive amounts of paste to keep a denture in, then the denture probably needs to be remade or relined (or perhaps an implant supported denture should be considered in cases of severe bone</li>
<li> I was skeptical, especially for almost $20 a tube.</li>
<li> I followed the instructions to the letter, but that was pointless.  </li>
<li> Even a few people want a pair, so i reccommended these!</li>
<li> I am more than disappointed that a product I have used over 15 years has been discontinued!!!</li>
<li> too expensive for daily use.  </li>
<li> In my case adding a small amount of dental adhesive with it worked for me and lasted about a week.  </li>
<li> I now have a painless denture, I can eat crunchy food, no more sore gums</li>
<li> (It&#x27;s strings for me.)&lt;br /&gt;- don&#x27;t go overboard smoothing it out.</li>
<li> plus it will not disappoint you, kept tooth in place for days, don&#x27;t waste money on another product !</li>
<li> Gets just as gooey as the past and lasted 1 day</li>
<li> I buy mine at Walgreens and they usually have it in stock.</li>
<li> Fills in small area and no need for fix a dent.</li>
<li> t don&#x27;t think ill get as much lasting time .out</li>
<li> and I had no more ashivie, guess what I used Cushion Grip</li>
<li> This is the most terrible product I have ever used!!!!  </li>
<li> However, we found some later and it was half the price I paid for it online, so that was disappointing.</li>
<li> i mean a few hours.</li>
<li> I used it on my lower dentures and it didn&#x27;t work, but I think that is due to the poor workmanship of the office that made my set.</li>
<li> With fingers, spread Cushion Grip ball from one end of gum groove to the other in a thin even layer.</li>
<li> It lasts a long time and is not sticky or distasteful.  </li>
<li> It is darn near impossible to remove from dentures once it is on.</li>
<li> I was about to resign myself to being miserable the rest of my life with these dentures, but now I know I&#x27;m going to be just fine.  </li>
<li> it help the lower hard molds be softer for you to chew on</li>
<li> It is extremely hard to remove as it becomes a plastic and adheres to the plates but not your mouth.  </li>
<li> Yet another time, I could hardly get it out.</li>
<li> Hard to find in stores in my area.</li>
<li> like I&#x27;ve got HARD Plastic against mah gums.</li>
<li> I checked for the ingredients and hard to believe there is Fluoride in there ....</li>
<li> IT WAS TOO HARD</li>
<li> You can use it repairng hard plastic items.</li>
<li> This product is expensive &amp; delivers sub-standard performance, making it a BIG WASTE OF MONEY!!!</li>
<li> Keep it in there for at least 20 minutes like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It took me at least another 30 minutes to get the stuff out of my mouth and off my dentures.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews.</li>
<li> At least with Cushion Grip with adhesive, I could go all day without any problem including eating.  </li>
<li> So I am using it like a regular adhesive, applying it cold.</li>
<li> duh.</li>
<li> AT LEAST FOR ME</li>
<li> but I read a review that talked about soaking it for 10 minutes in cold water and white vinegar.  </li>
<li> I would recommend toughing it out for at least a couple of weeks, and I would also recommend getting your adjustments.</li>
<li> Another pain to use at least for me - would not buy it again.</li>
<li> /&gt;Temporary solution and when i mean temporary</li>
<li> and I mean this that no one ever does this to you.</li>
<li> When I say at all, I mean I could not even eat a banana with this.  </li>
<li> very very disappointed, had extremely high hopes based on other reviews.</li>
<li> This stuff is nasty doesn&#x27;t work and it takes forever to clean |your dentures</li>
<li> Its difficult to apply and not worth the money.</li>
<li> I thought this would actually work at holding my dentures, but I was very wrong.  </li>
<li> that&#x27;s kinda ridiculous.</li>
<li> I bought cushion grip from amazon 4 tubes for less than 30 dollars ;why is it so expensive now ?</li>
<li> I think only stupid people will have trouble using this product.</li>
<li> The next application was awful and I went back to paste adhesives.  </li>
<li> ( she did say it would be) but what she failed to mention was that it would melt the cap and when opened it would spew out everywhere which led to half a tube in my bathroom floor.</li>
<li> Price is ridiculous for all it does.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s kinda like a reline but softer and a LOT less expensive.</li>
<li> I will no longer be purchasing this item at  this ridiculous price.</li>
<li> It is still hard to get out, and you are going to have a lot of \\&quot;fun\\&quot; if you have weak, arthritic hands.     </li>
<li> This stuff is a little difficult to work with...</li>
<li> , I am scared to take my teeth out now because others here are complaining on how hard it is to remove the cushion grip from the dentures and from ur mouth as well!</li>
<li> The chemicals in this adhesive are somewhat caustic with the gums, just not a good product at all.  </li>
<li> This stuff is very hard to work with.</li>
<li> if you don&#x27;t know what ur doing this stuff is very hard to use.</li>
<li> My dentures are very loose, so without cushion grip, they would be impossible to wear.  </li>
<li> Very disappointed to pay so much and it look like it did.</li>
<li> A lot less expensive than getting a reline!</li>
<li> This is a weird sort of &amp;#34;goo&amp;#34; that comes out malleable like fairly hard putty.</li>
<li> Even after I faithfully followed the instructions, I got poor results.  </li>
<li> I was not happy with this product.</li>
<li> This is the worse stuff they make and to boot</li>
<li> False advertisement.</li>
<li> As it is, it is very difficult to apply, it does not cause my lower denture to be as tight as I would like</li>
<li> The results are dramatic.</li>
<li> I was so desperate I was even considering going into hock to get some implants, but have read negatives about those as well, not the least of which is $$$.  </li>
<li> Too bad it is so hard to find anymore.</li>
<li> i found it to be extremely difficult to remove also.</li>
<li> It helps to hold teeth a bit but its not a perfect product.  </li>
<li> To expensive doesn&#x27;t work would have returned if I could have figured out how.</li>
<li> /&gt;Updated - it did not hold the molding, so for me Cushion Grip is a fail...</li>
<li> Sad it is discontinued</li>
<li> As useless as the product I purchased it for.</li>
<li> Sorry cushion grip you have lost another customer.</li>
<li> Before you start saying I must have done it wrong, I have news from you.</li>
<li> TO EXPENSIVE</li>
<li> Scary.</li>
<li> I am sorry I bought</li>
<li> Too expensive.</li>
<li> Sorry, I do not like the Cushion Grip..</li>
<li> Why is it so difficult to find?</li>
<li> I find it difficult to rate a product I&#x27;ve never used.  </li>
<li> so ill</li>
<li> too difficult to work with</li>
<li> this is so wrong</li>
<li> dont know if i did something wrong</li>
<li> He was unable to find in retail stores.</li>
<li> Sorry</li>
<li> sad to say u lost a customer.</li>
<li> Sorry</li>
<li> It&#x27;s just sad about the price gouging of product.</li>
<li> this product is very poor .</li>
<li> and it was horrible trying to get it on the partial.</li>
<li> I just stumbled across this item while looking online for something other than that nasty goop I had been using to hold the dentures, and because of the reviews at this site, I figured what did I have to lose?  </li>
<li> A sticky horrible mess.</li>
<li> place in cold cold water helps)</li>
<li> I happened across cushion grip and I was afraid to hope -</li>
<li> Tedious, annoying and useless are the 3 words I&#x27;d use to describe the process of getting my dentures prepared with Cushion Grip.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a dirty shame that I, had to PAY over 68.00 DOLLARS for this product.</li>
<li> but I purchased it anyway because I was desperate.</li>
<li> Remember that Cushion Grip is waterproof, so you can wash your mouth and use mouth wash, but use cold water.&lt;br</li>
<li> Remember that Cushion Grip is waterproof, so you can wash your mouth and use mouth wash, but use cold water.&lt;br</li>

    <li> Too bad stopped making this a life safer. Complain to the manufacturer to bring back. This was about $4.50 a tube but remaining stock is about 27.00 and up!  What a shame they</li>
    <li> This is good ! I have used it for years.</li>
    <li> might work for someone whose dentures wll line up-however-i have a full upper and a partial lower and due to unusual circumstances, i cannot bear down evenly to get a good seal. wth me it was a shot n the dark. i found it to be extremely difficult to remove also. even if i had gotten a good seal, the price is too high.</li>
    <li> The product is excellent, however, it is very overpriced!</li>
    <li> Very good. Exceptional.</li>
    <li> Great for new and old denture wearers.  Better than strips, gooey mess, or powder. Very Comfortable.</li>
    <li> works great, makes my partial comfortable to wear all day</li>
    <li> This is an ok item but I don&#x27;t think it is any better than any other product like this. I would recommend you give it a try.</li>
    <li> It works as described. But it is too little amount for the price. I fee that it is enough for only 4 application.</li>
    <li> Not much you can say about cushion grip adhesive except it works or it doesn&#x27;t. Happy to say it works! Enough said.</li>
    <li> I aM totally floored!  I purchased what I thought was 12 tunes of cushion grip for 72.48. It was NOT 12!  It was one tune which cvs charges $7.00 for!  Who do I contact to return and have my charges reversed?  This is theft by misrepresentation!</li>
    <li> It was ok but was not to impress was to much to do it might be ok for others but not my cup of tea</li>
    <li> I used another product to reline my own dentures which worked great. I use this cushion grip as a supplement when I plan on doing some heavy eating. If followed as directed it works well and is easy to remove, it&#x27;s not a bit messy is why I chose it. As a note I also have/use polident powder but it doesn&#x27;t last very long for me and polygrip is a mess. The Cushion Grip Thermoplastic Denture Adhesive does work well and doesn&#x27;t dissolve so is there until you are ready to remove it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for a relative. Apparently,  it is no longer being produced. He rates it higher in comfort and adhesiveness. He was complaining about not finding it in traditional retail stores. He was excited to know he can order it through Amazon.  Although a bit pricey, at his stage in life; comfort has a value which is sometimes not cost sensitive.</li>
    <li> PRODUCT WAS DEFECTIVE, CANNOT GET IT REPLACED NOR A REFUND.    DON&#x27;T DEAL WITH THESE PEOPLE</li>
    <li> For those Older denture users who have lower dentures, this product is very helpful for you . as u know the uppers never move and the bottoms do the &amp;#34;grinding work&amp;#34;. it help the lower hard molds be softer for you to chew on things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE DONT USE MY FULL NAME  THANK YOU.  just Betty will do  thank u again!!!</li>
    <li> I just want to say I am glad I used Amazon.com for my purchase for denture adhesive. I live in Dexter Maine, I have checked all the stores and pharmacies and could not find the denture adhesive \\&quot;Cushion Grip\\&quot;. I looked on Amazon.com found it and ordered it, I had my product within three days. I just want to say Thank You Amazon.com for being so prompt with my order. I would recommend you to everyone.</li>
    <li> I love this item. I&#x27;ll make another order, later....Thank you. Happy Holidays.</li>
    <li> This product is no longer available where I live,but Amazon had it and I will order it again when needed.I have always found what I needed at Amazon at reasonable prices.Amazon can&#x27;t be beat as far as I am concerned.Thanks Amazon!!</li>
    <li> Its a 5 star product if used correctly. I put 1 star because of all the 1 star reviews -I look at those first on products -this is one product I have used and know that it works. The BAD -its been discontinued probably by dental lobbyists because its a great alternative to going back in for relines. I get my relines included but its still a pain to go. However, I agree people should go in for adjustments and relines and if you hate your dentist -find another one-instead of relying on these products. If you need to get by for a few weeks or few months -this product works great BUT you shouldn&#x27;t use to completely avoid regular yearly checkups and adjustments.&lt;br /&gt;This product adheres very well to dentures. It provides cushion, comfort and fills the space that comes from receding gums and bones after extractions. Lasts for weeks for this purpose - I still use Secure &#x27;with&#x27; myrrh and aloe vera to hold the denture in place, the regular Secure doesnt work at all. . Fixodent works great in all forms but the taste is terrible and makes my stomach feel raw. Hopefully someone will produce a Cushion Grip thats affordable but Im thinking dentist greed shut down production of this product.</li>
    <li> Did not work as expected for being recommended I did not like</li>
    <li> The product is great but the price is outrageous !</li>
    <li> My dad had me order cushion grip for him before. When he had me order again I though I&#x27;d give it a try after reading other reviews. Beets using glue hands down. You can lieve it in longer than recommended. I&#x27;m on two weeks now and its still holding good. Wish I would have found cushion grip when I started wearing dentures years ago. Recommend this stuff 100%.</li>
    <li> This may be the world&#x27;s worst product. It is hard to work with, even when following the directions carefully. Once in place, it squishes out of your dentures all over the outside. No matter how much you clean it off, moer of it squishes right back out again. In addition, even after letting it set for thirty minutes or more, when the denture is removed, the cushion grip plastic like substance stays in your mouth; not in the denture. No doubt, this manufacture was trying to make a product to help people but it does not work.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, he used it and said that it didn&#x27;t hold his bottom denture in AT ALL and that only held his top denture in for a short time, maybe 8 hours.  He followed the directions so that wasn&#x27;t the problem.</li>
    <li> Item not needed based on purchasing this item in conjunction with the Imako Cosmetic Teeth.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Cushion Grip\\&quot; is a paste that is formulated to hold loose dentures in place for a long time - several days in fact (not that it is recommended to keep a denture in for days on end!).  Said another way, the paste has properties that allow it to remain retentive for several days.  I have recommended it to some of my denture patients (if they have a properly made denture, yet still need added retention).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have to use excessive amounts of paste to keep a denture in, then the denture probably needs to be remade or relined (or perhaps an implant supported denture should be considered in cases of severe bone loss).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;konedog</li>
    <li> Did not work and gave of a burning sensation</li>
    <li> It helps better than anything I have found.  I give it a three for the best by far is inplants to hole the lower denture in place without adhesives or other like items.  I have found it best to let the Cushion Grip to &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; over night.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years with great success. At one time Walmart and other stores were selling it. But now I only find it here on Amazon. John</li>
    <li> If this isn&#x27;t some massive price gouging, a $7 + tube of cushion grip you could get at CVS going for $20 good luck with that little venture</li>
    <li> Save my life from constant pain and discomfort I was in for the last 10 years. Amazing product. Easy to use. Prompt delivery. I will highly recommend it to every body how wears dentures.</li>
    <li> This stuff is nasty doesn&#x27;t work and it takes forever to clean |your dentures I do not recommend this product way over price and you get crap</li>
    <li> It helps to hold teeth a bit but its not a perfect product.  It works like a liner - sometimes that helps but not always.</li>
    <li> did not work as advertised</li>
    <li> After using every adhesive cream, wafer, powder that I could get my hands on I am so thankful that I gave \\&quot;cushion grip\\&quot; a shot.    Just minutes ago I tried it for the first time, and can I tell you - my denture feels more snug than the day I had it put in.    To think I&#x27;ll be able to keep this in for 4-5 days is priceless.  To think that I can eat corn on the cob, or bit into an apple is heaven.    YAY!  This product makes having dentures not so bad after all.</li>
    <li> it is a pain to apply but it is the only thing that works for more than a few minutes</li>
    <li> cushion grip is awesome! i recently found out the the co that made it was bought out and the supply of it will no longer be available! i have gone into serious anxiety over this as i cannot believe that after 5 yrs of suffering i finally found a miracle product that is no longer available. i am now looking for a scientist that can recreate same substance!!! kidding. everything i xperienced thru Amazon and delivery to using product has just been amazing. thank you</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my sister because it is the the only denture product that she will use.</li>
    <li> My mother had needed some more Cushion Grip and we couldn&#x27;t find it in any of the stores. She uses this because her lower dentures are too big and she can&#x27;t afford to get them fixed. This helps as a temporary fix to the problem. I was so happy to have found this for her. Thank you again.</li>
    <li> My husband is very pleased with our order of cushion grip. Amazon.com sent our order very quick and we are very pleased. We&#x27;ll be ordering again in the future.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my mom. It is the only denture cream she&#x27;s found that works good and is comfortable. They just recently stopped selling it in stores like they do everything that actually works. So I&#x27;ll be ordering from here for now on and I&#x27;ll be ordering for 2 people now. My coworker just got dentures so she&#x27;s going to try it too. It&#x27;s the best one out there and it goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Pros: (1) makes dentures fit like a glove (2) can eat most foods when applied (3) last longer than 5 days (4) my dentures stop hurting my gums with this  Cons: (1) not the easiest thing in the world to get out of the tube; you have to squeeze it with effort (2) it is sticky messy but despite the cons I continue to buy and use it because the pros out weigh the cons especially having fitting dentures! (3) is a pain to remove it when it is time to come off (4) also takes time to dry once you put it on the dentures (place in cold cold water helps) AGAIN IT IS WORTH ANY TROUBLE</li>
    <li> I REPIT THE COMENT FROM BIG G OF SEPTEMBER 28,2011.WHY TO WASTE MORE TIME FOR THIS JUNK.THEY JUST E-MAIL ME REGARDING MY COMPLAIN SAYING NOBODY CLAIMED ABOUT THIS PRODUCT AND RECOMEND ME TO SEE A DENTIST OR MD (WHAT TIPE,MENTAL DOCTOR??)</li>
    <li> This product made a comfortable cushion for my dentures, but it did not adhere well to my gums.  The dentures rocked a little and on the third day when I bit on something firm my denture broke in two!  This denture was nearly new!  I think this product could possibly be useful if your dentures were way too big and you needed to fill in the gaps.  Also, I think someone suggested adding fixodent on top of it so it will adhere to your gums better.</li>
    <li> I had great expectations of this product because nothing else has worked, I followed the directions as stated and it didn&#x27;t secure my teeth at all not even minutes.</li>
    <li> Wow. This is one product that you can trust the great reviews for! I was skeptical, especially for almost $20 a tube. I was have awful issues with my plates so I decided to try it based on how consistent the good reviews were. This product does exactly what it says. As soon as you put it in your mouth you feel the difference. There is no poking or rocking or lifting. They feel so snug and soft, with no adhesive. It is worth a try, especially if you&#x27;re early in recovering and shrinking fast.</li>
    <li> I have used cushion grip for years.  Its the only thing that works. When I saw it disappearing off mom and pop drug store shelves  8 year or so ago I knew something was up. Batang $60 for a2 that&#x27;s kinda ridiculous. That I needed It</li>
    <li> Excellent but  price is dreadful  I am 😝90 years  and it&#x27;s the only adhesive  that will stay on my lower denture have used it for years to me it is wonderful but now I must make it stay longer</li>
    <li> very good product this product holds even eating Corn on the cob love the cushion grip cant use anyting eles since i started using cushion grip</li>
    <li> The best I&#x27;ve found and can&#x27;t get better!  It&#x27;s a little over priced but it&#x27;s worth it.  You don&#x27;t need no other.</li>
    <li> Does not last more than regular adhesives.   I waited an hour beforeeating or drinking. It is extremely hard to remove as it becomes a plastic and adheres to the plates but not your mouth.  Cleaning the product from the dental plates is almost impossible, had to wait for some of it to wear off.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  When dentures wear down after awhile this is an one of the best I&#x27;ve found to making the dentures fit like they are suppose to. Back this product 100%</li>
    <li> did not hold has stated</li>
    <li> My review is limited at this time, I haven&#x27;t actually used the product yet. I bought it locally, it turns out I paid a couple bucks more! I was under the impression that there were only sellers who required you to buy this stuff in quantity, I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Even with shipping, this stuff comes out over a buck cheaper, purchased her on Amazon, as opposed to what I paid at CVS.&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------&lt;br /&gt;The one downside, it seems to me, with this product, is that you&#x27;re supposed to apply it to DRY dentures. I love powdered adhesives, because you take the dentures outa the soak water. I use Walgreen&#x27;s house-brand denture tablets. I see that denture tabs are at least as cheap at Target, probably cheap at dollar stores--I don&#x27;t know for sure about dollar stores.&lt;br /&gt;--------------------&lt;br /&gt;So--powder is expected to be dusted over wet dentures. This means that you rinse your dentures, boom, they&#x27;re good to go. No drying required.&lt;br /&gt;------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Occasionally, I use a paste adhesive(aka goo). One is expected to dry the dentures first. I goofed and didn&#x27;t dry my dentures first. Amazing--the paste adhesive worked even better when it WASN&#x27;T properly dried!&lt;br /&gt;Did you know peanut butter works in a pinch as an adhesive?&lt;br /&gt;----------------------&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t really need this Cushion Grip stuff, I will get around to testing it. I just felt I should know how other products, such as this one, perform. I rated this a 4 star, as I haven&#x27;t actually used the product yet. Since this product already is rated at an average of 4 stars, I&#x27;m not throwing off the ratings.&lt;br /&gt;-------------------&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll test the product, then come back and possibly change my rating, giving my reasons for doing so.&lt;br /&gt;------------------------&lt;br /&gt;For now, my best advice is to test the product. And you may as well buy it here and save a buck or so. Wish I&#x27;d realized that this seller would let you buy single tubes. If you&#x27;re in a huge hurry, go to CVS. Otherwise, buy it here.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fairly new denture wearer, and I&#x27;ve had no luck at all with the adhesives I&#x27;ve tried.  I had sore spots on my gums that just got worse each time I put my dentures in and tried to eat anything, a pinching on the back end of the top palate every time I swallowed, and a shifting and loosening of the bottom denture (even when \\&quot;secured\\&quot; with that goopy awful Polident) every time I&#x27;d eat something that had to be well chewed.  I just stumbled across this item while looking online for something other than that nasty goop I had been using to hold the dentures, and because of the reviews at this site, I figured what did I have to lose?  If I had had to scrape that horrible, rubbery Polident off my gums one more time, I was going to just give up!!!  I was to the point where I&#x27;d only put the dentures in when I had to eat or be seen in public.  Today I tried the Comfort Grip for the first time, not really believing that all the hype could be true.  Lo and behold, both dentures secured themselves tightly and every sore spot was gone!  The word \\&quot;comfort\\&quot; in the name of this product really does mean COMFORT!  The dentures feel SO secure, and I even ate some thick slices of roast beef for lunch and was able to chew it without the dentures moving even a millimeter.  I&#x27;m so happy I&#x27;m just about beside myself with it!  I was about to resign myself to being miserable the rest of my life with these dentures, but now I know I&#x27;m going to be just fine.  I can&#x27;t believe my luck in finding this product.  I just now ordered a four-pack to keep on hand when my first order runs out, and I&#x27;m going to continue ordering four-packs every so often just in case this product goes off the market.  I&#x27;m not taking ANY chances.  Wow, do I love this stuff, or WHAT?</li>
    <li> I got this product for a 95 year old young lady who says nothing else will keep her dentures in place.  We looked in many stores but were only able to find it online.  She was/is very pleased with this product.  Also, the delivery was right on schedule.  Highly recommend the entire process.</li>
    <li> This product always arrives quick and is never damaged.  It makes my dentures very comfortable until I can go and get my permanent reline done.  Do exactly what it says in the instructions and you will be satisfied.  I still have to use a bit of adhesive as this is not an adhesive but a soft pliable cushion liner.  I wish I could by it locally.</li>
    <li> I just purchased Cushion Grip off this website and am sadly disappointed. I have used this product for a year and could no longer get it at Walmart so I ordered it off the internet. This product looked identical in all ways but when I used it it was soft and never hardened like the product I am familiar with.</li>
    <li> Wish this hadn&#x27;t been discontinued.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> This stuff is a little difficult to work with...but...if your dentures are loose particularly if you have very little gum left (bottom plate for me...this stuff is worth the difficulty.  You can stiss put regular denture adhesive on top of it, but I don&#x27;t.  This stuff is not really an adhesive like polygrip...it is more like a liner.  I&#x27;m ordering more!</li>
    <li> I have been a denture wearer for many years and have religiously used fixodent. Of course now we hear that it contains harmful amounts of zinc. I happened across cushion grip and I was afraid to hope - even fixodent did not hold my dentures like I wanted. I would like to clear something up for those who are dissappointed with the product. I discovered that it really is not an adhesive to hold the dentures to your gums (obviously this is why you can clean them and soak them for at least 4 days). The beauty of this product is that it builds up your dentures so you they feel like they did when you first got them, maybe even better. I discovered that I apply the cushion grip and about 2 hours later take out dentures and apply light layer of polygrip zinc free and it holds like never before...and no more worries about zinc and having to use denture creams that don&#x27;t really hold. So, don&#x27;t expect cushion grip to be a suction type adhesive. It is the foundation it provides so you can use your denture adhesive if you need to and notice how well it holds. I feel so confident now and I cannot say enough about this product...and I do not work for the company. I work at a church. :-) [[ASIN:B001V9MT08 CUSHION GRIP ADHESIVE 1 OZ]]</li>
    <li> I have had my dentures for a little over one year and was so sorry that I had agreed to have the remaining top teeth pulled and a partial on the bottom.  I used to have to clean and then apply adhesive cream followed with an adhesive powder on top of that just to have them stay for a few hours the start again.  My dentures would \\&quot;rock back and forth\\&quot; on the top and the partial just simply popped up.  Since I began using Cushion Grip it is like a new world!! I was very hesitant to try due to some of the reviews which made is sound so hard to do.  It is not hard at all just takes a little more time than squirting cream and going. I warm the tube in very hot water, clean and dry the dentures in a dry sink into which I also place the tube so everything gets heated up nicely.  Put in the partial as directed, rewarm the upper plate and tube and then apply a but more than a \\&quot;thin layer\\&quot; which is what the directions call for. Wait 10 minutes and good to go!!! I take them out daily to clean and after a few days they feel slightly not as tight so i tried just sprinkling with an adhesive powder and unbelievably the combination is GREAT!!! Even with taking them out to clean every day the application lasts not for 4 days but much longer.  I have only let it go for one week but I know that I could go much, much longer if need be. This product is so comfortable you will be wondering why this is not available everywhere!! Do your self a favor and get it today!! You will not regreat it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to dentures and have used the pastes that are very gooey and hard to remove when you take dentures out. Cushion grip is a removable liner, and as your gums shrink you don&#x27;t have to keep running to the dentist for a reline. Hopefully when I get my permanent denture I won&#x27;t need anything, but til then......great stuff. I can&#x27;t find this in stores and delivery is fast. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This does a great job holding my Billy Bob teeth in.  I would highly recommend this to anyone using a grip to hold loose false teeth in.</li>
    <li> Well, I got the product today and I have mixed feelings. I used it on my lower dentures and it didn&#x27;t work, but I think that is due to the poor workmanship of the office that made my set. I used it on my uppers and WOW!!! I love the way they fit and this was not as hard to use as people made it seem. I will be buying this again!!!</li>
    <li> THIS DENTURE ADHESIVE IS REALLY GREAT, I HAVE BEEN USEING IT FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS. I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> I had searched for a product that would hold my denture in place while eating and this is the perfect product.  You only need to replace it about every 3 - 4 days.</li>
    <li> This has a very bad smell and leaves your mouth with a bad taste. It may work for others but I didn&#x27;t care for it.</li>
    <li> Cushion Grip is by far the best product on the market for comfortably fitting all dentures, even partial dentures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company does not want you to know this but if you apply it right, it will last more than a month easily from one application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what I have discovered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure the dentures are clean and free from all residue of any other adhesive material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put the denture (or dentures - upper/lower) in a dry bathroom sink. Put the tube of Cushion Grip in the sink with the dentures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get a good hair dryer and set it on HOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turn the hair dryer on and place it in the sink so it is shooting hot air at the dentures and cushion grip tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let it run for one minute which super dries the dentures and significantly heats up the dentures and cushion grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take them out of the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For upper dentures, squeeze out a ball of cushion grip into the denture. You may have to use a cloth to hold the tube as it will be hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the ball of cushion grip is in the denture, take your finger and smear it around the curve where you gum connects to the denture and then bring it across the back of the denture. Really press the cushion grip material firmly onto the denture all around in every area. As it cools off, it gets less sticky and then you can really press it hard onto the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let it sit there for at least ten minutes. Then you put it in place in your mouth and bite down firmly enough to get it to set to your mouth. Keep it in there for at least 20 minutes like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then take it out and cut off the excess adhesive material so it is only on the entire surface of the denture and not sticking out around the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will last for at least one month like this. I have left it for up to two months with total success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can throw it in an denture cleaner bath. The best denture cleaner by far on the market is Renew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That company is the same as they tell you the solution for cleaning will only last one day or maybe two and that it does not work with partial dentures with metal. This is simply not true at all as I have extensively used Renew (the price on Renew is very good also) and found the following to be true:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only need to put a small amount of renew in your denture bath and it will last easily two weeks to a month. I have also used it for longer than one month and it works perfectly. As with all denture cleaners you should also disinfect the dentures every couple of days with some Xepro spray that is a totally non-toxic cleanser that kills all unfriendly bacteria and viruses on contact. I soak my dentures over night every day and have the cleanest, most beautiful dentures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For partial dentures, do the same thing - just make sure you divide the cushion grip material up and everything has to be hot to work. Press the material firmly and if it is a tight space on the lower denture, get a thin strong piece of wood or something that will fit into the tight spaces and really press the material firmly on the denture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is imperative you leave it for 10 minutes to cure before putting in the mouth. You can press the material anytime during the curing process to get it to stick better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be afraid - aggressively apply these products and use them to the maximum and you will be very pleased to see how good they work and that they really last a long long time. This will save you big money over the years.

    <li> mom loves it...too bad they took it off the market and now the few tubes left cost a whole weeks salary</li>
    <li> A sticky horrible mess. I do not recommend you put this stuff in your mouth.</li>
    <li> To expensive doesn&#x27;t work would have returned if I could have figured out how.</li>
    <li> After reading rave reviews on Cushion Grip, I was excited to try it after getting my new dentures (also a first timer with the dentures). I was using Poligrip powder and was thrilled with it for about 3 days. Not sure what changed, probably my mouth - but it is no longer holding for more than 6 hours before it completely lets go. I had ordered Cushion Grip to have on hand just in case, and was thrilled to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application to the denture was not all that difficult, I did apply too much initially, just takes a tiny bit and that goes a long way. However after putting it on, I waited the suggested 5 minutes and placed them in my mouth. Holy cows does that stuff burn! I read all the other reviews after this experience, and it seems only 1 or 2 people have had a similar experience. The burning was so severe that after \\&quot;fitting\\&quot; them, I had to remove them. I have no idea how this will effect the molding of the product, I am hoping it sets up, as they were quite comfortable and stayed in place quite well - but the burning gums were completely alarming. Will update once I have further experience with the product. For now, disappointed but hopeful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated - it did not hold the molding, so for me Cushion Grip is a fail...very very disappointed, had extremely high hopes based on other reviews.</li>
    <li> this has been a MUST HAVE product for me for about 5 years now.I discovered that I can&#x27;t find it locally anymore.Luckily,Amazon.com has stepped up to fill the void-and at a price that competes with the store -bought supply .Way to go ,Amazon![[ASIN:B001EJOPQG Cushion Grip Thermoplastic Denture Adhesive, 1-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)]]</li>
    <li> This is the worst product I ever bought I followed the directions very carfully &amp; it never worked, I thought  when I bought Cushion Grip it would be A great denture adhesive, so i purchase four big mistake i tryed to get a refund but never did.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions exactly and this stuff would not stick. It is darn near impossible to remove from dentures once it is on.</li>
    <li> It takes you a couple of times to get the procedure down and I had to leave it in the hot tap water a little longer for it to be manageable. Mine did not last 3-4-5 days, it lasted one-half day. But as long as I had it in, it felt good and made it more tolerable in eating because it wouldn&#x27;t let as much food up under the lower denture. Would I use it again? Sure, just because of that reason I listed above about the food. I will probably use this instead of buying denture glue. Why buy both?</li>
    <li> I wanted to use Cushion Grip for a while (3 months) before I submitted a review. This purchase was made out of desperation to save my partial. Now, thankfully, Cushion Grip is the only adhesive I&#x27;ll ever use. My partial has never been so secure. Please read the other reviews, as I did, to use the proper application technique. I only wish the color was more pink like gums or clear. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> My mom needed it for her dentures, she needed a reline and we lived far from that dentist, so this lasted plenty until she could get to the dentist! :)</li>
    <li> An excellent product, have used it for many years, and will continue to do so.  Too bad so many retail stores no longer carry it.</li>
    <li> I have used this type of product before and have found it to be a good alternative to the expense of having dentures relined by Dentist.  Even though directions say you should still go to Dentist as soon as possible and that this product is only a temporary solution, the last time I used it, it lasted 3 years. Being retired and on a fixed income, this helps a lot.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Sad it is discontinued</li>
    <li> I am familiar with this product although I question why there was a recall. Perhaps I don&#x27;t want to find out because this is the only thing that helps me as much as it does.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my friend for a denture adhesive.I found it doesnt hold in the dentures. Its difficult to apply and not worth the money. I went back to fixadent.</li>
    <li> I have tried every denture adhesive on the market, and this, without a doubt, is the best. By following the directions, it goes on easily and will last up to 4 days before you remove it. You can clean your dentures with whatever method you prefer and the adhesive will still adhere. It also conforms to where it is needed most.</li>
    <li> I can not rate this product. I have not used this product, I thought this would work with another product I ordered but since I did not get the ordered product to work as intended the denture adhesive was not necessary.</li>
    <li> Junk! Crap! Ripoff! This stuff does not hold dentures, and is a mess to clean off dentures. Definitely, don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product and I am appalled that I could not find it locally - I did once and seemingly it disappeared from the market!</li>
    <li> I found this the only adhesive I could use that would last five days. It conforms to tender spots   and weight gain and loss. I have original dentures still thanks to Cushion Grip</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m somewhat new to wearing dentures, so I have been busy trying just about every way to secure my dentures in place, and out of all of the things I&#x27;ve tried, Cushion Grip was the biggest failure!  First, it took me half an hour to set it all up and get the dentures in my mouth.  I followed the instructions to the letter, but that was pointless.  Tedious, annoying and useless are the 3 words I&#x27;d use to describe the process of getting my dentures prepared with Cushion Grip.  Given that I have rheumatoid arthritis and some pretty severe nerve damage in my hands, this prep work was harder on me than average, but had the stuff at least worked well, it would&#x27;ve been worth it.  It wasn&#x27;t.  An hour later, I go to yawn, and my upper plate falls.  Thankfully, I was sitting in the car waiting for a friend who had run in quickly to get something.  I would&#x27;ve died had it been witnessed by others!    To add insult to injury, when I get home to take out my dentures for the night, I found that removing the gunk that was Cushion Grip from my dentures was a nightmare!  It took me at least another 30 minutes to get the stuff out of my mouth and off my dentures.  Horrific!  I couldn&#x27;t throw away the tube of CG fast enough!    IMHO, this stuff is a waste of money and time.</li>
    <li> The best I&#x27;ve tried yet.</li>
    <li> Works fine but just doesn&#x27;t last too long. I have found a different product that I like better so I don&#x27;t use this any more.</li>
    <li> They were hard to get used to at first and I did have to mold them a few times but after i got them just right there perfect!!! I wear them everywhere!!! And everyone likes them and thinks they look good! Even a few people want a pair, so i reccommended these! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This product should be used with good fitting dentures and ones that are not roughed up.  takes a bit to get used to taking it off but it does make for a comfortable hold.</li>
    <li> I am more than disappointed that a product I have used over 15 years has been discontinued!!!</li>
    <li> had trouble with removing and cleaning off teeth Not worth returning.still in my med cabinet.might find another use for it.</li>
    <li> What with  the $6.00 price ti get u to look%</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t want to stay where put on the plate- burns my mouth. Bubblegum would do a better job, and taste nicer. You have been warned by someone who has tried it, followed directions exactly, and wishes I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money- I had already trashed the tube and packaging when I realized I could have gotten a refund- ptui!</li>
    <li> Dentures stay in super nice for a long period of time, no after taste. Easy to manipulate in the&lt;br /&gt;form that is needed.</li>
    <li> I drove to 5 different stores covering over 150 miles and spent over 4 hours looking for this product for a family member who swears by it and won&#x27;t settle for anything else.  Stores just don&#x27;t seem to carry it any more.  We&#x27;re glad to find it online at Amazon.  The manufacturer needs to contact my family member for a truly honest,  bona fide commercial.</li>
    <li> Well, I got some if this stuff and was exited, so I tried it. Desperatly  trying to find something&lt;br /&gt;so that teeth didn&#x27;t fall out when ever they wanted. Still looking for something that  works. That&#x27;s all I got to say about that!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love it but it is a little expensive/ tell me something in 2014 I bought cushion grip from amazon 4 tubes for less than 30 dollars ;why is it so expensive now ? I would like to know this does not seem right.</li>
    <li> cushion grip is great for temporary use. It is not necessary to use a lot. a small ball goes a long way. read instructions carefully.</li>
    <li> I was horrible.....its gooey. I had to throw it away after the first use......it was a waste of my money&lt;br /&gt;...</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! But please someone tell me!  What happened to the price?  I paid 14.99$ for it last time I got it and it is. Ten times higher!</li>
    <li> As useless as the product I purchased it for. Smh</li>
    <li> Highly recommended! Don&#x27;t expect a miracle as dentures are an imperfect replacement for the real thing. It works a described and you may have to still use a little bit of another daily use type of adhesive with it. I do this and never have a problem the whole day or evening. Even after 18 hours it is still a little bit of a chore to remove them from my mouth but my dentures have remained tightly seated and comfortable all day.</li>
    <li> easy to work with and feels good.  I have tried numerous products the best of which was denturite by sea bond but they saw fit to discontinue.  This product requires no mixing.  Just smooth it out, bite down gently, let set up and you&#x27;re  done. No bad taste.</li>
    <li> This is a reliner not an adhesive. Not that easy to put on dentures as it is of a plastic consistency and tube must be heated before using it - then must wait awhile for it to somewhat harden and set. You still must use adhesives if you do not dentures will still be loose. I really don&#x27;t think it is worth all that trouble. You must be careful removing the cushion grip to put new strip in so as not to drop or damage dentures.</li>
    <li> This the only thing that works for my loose dentures. I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews. It&#x27;s easy to apply and to remove just run warm or hot water over your denture. I think only stupid people will have trouble using this product.</li>
    <li> When I first bought Cushion Grip Thermoplastic Adhesive, which, by the way, I found at CVS, I was so excited. I paid $7.99 plus tax for it. Since I&#x27;m on a fixed income, and my husband is unemployed, we try to keep our expenses low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a set back, financially. I know it doesn&#x27;t seem like much, but when you don&#x27;t have that much coming in to begin with, you want what you buy to deliver. I thought I was going to finally be able to eat normally again. As it is, it is very difficult to apply, it does not cause my lower denture to be as tight as I would like so I can eat without an adhesive, and it caused my gums to burn. I followed the directions of one reviewer here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I put Cushion Grip in, after setting it, along with my denture, in a sink to heat them both up, I put it in my denture and then in my mouth. (I have a hint-use a ridged cloth or towel to keep them from bouncing around.)I could not believe how much it burned my gums. My denture seemed to be firm enough, at first, but shortly afterwards, it became loose again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One time, I didn&#x27;t bite down as hard, and I took my denture out right away, waited for five minutes, then put it back in my mouth, as the instruction sheet directed. Then it didn&#x27;t burn, but it didn&#x27;t adhere completely either. When I tried cutting the excess off, the whole application came out with one slight tug. That time, I, actually, could eat without an adhesive. I was so disappointed when Cushion Grip lifted right out without any real effort on my part. Yet another time, I could hardly get it out. That time, I had left it in for 20 minutes, pressing down the whole time as another reviewer suggested. That was also when it burned. Once I left off the pressure, it stopped burning right away. So that tells me it&#x27;s a chemical reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I wrote earlier, I still have to use an adhesive to keep my denture from coming up and rocking, while I&#x27;m eating-unless I just open my mouth about a quarter of an inch. Who can get most foods into her mouth in just that small amount of space! I know this isn&#x27;t supposed to be an adhesive, such as, Polident. But it is supposed to make a difference in the fit, of your denture, which, to some degree, it does. However, it does not make such a change that, for me, an adhesive isn&#x27;t necessary, which is what I desire the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since Cushion Grip made my gums feel like they were on fire, I called the company. I was told it would be replaced because it isn&#x27;t supposed to burn like that. They promised me I would receive a labeled package to send the old tube in. Then they would send me a new tube. I never received the email, they promised, nor the labeled envelope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For that reason, I don&#x27;t trust the company nor their product. This last time I used Cushion Grip, while trimming it, it tried coming out all at once again. I held it in, with my finger, and managed to keep the rest in my denture. At least, it is ok while I&#x27;m not eating. So, for that reason, I will continue using it until the tube is gone. (Better to go out in public with my denture in than without.) Then I&#x27;m looking for another product or way to reline my denture without dishing out the $550 my dentist wants to charge me. I found a web site where I can send it in and have it relined for around $29 or $39. I might just go that route, although I am trying to figure out how they can reline a denture without a form mold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe Cushion Grip works for some people, but, for me, it has proven not to be all that it&#x27;s cracked up to be. Speaking of cracks, something else I am not happy about is, if I use Cushion Grip longer than five or six days, it becomes dry and starts peeling, even if I soak clean it. This causes my gum to become sore. Then I can&#x27;t even wear my denture for a few days, until it heals again. So I&#x27;m pretty well stuck in the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like giving negative reviews, but in this case, I am seriously not very happywith this product. But I&#x27;m going to keep giving it a fair chance, at least, until I run out of it.until I run out of it.</li>
    <li> Good price always buy this product on line for my father. Hard to find in stores in my area. Dad says it the very best.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I found the dental  thermoplastic but I didn&#x27;t like the price but I will need another one before  too long.  I am disappointed that it isn&#x27;t available any more.</li>
    <li> This product was what I expected. It worked great. I would definitely buy it again. The price was very reasonable.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and bargain. I am never disappointed with my amazon purchases.</li>
    <li> Have used this for awhile,wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much.</li>
    <li> he must have liked it because he ordered more, but we never discussed it.  it made his smile nice and not lopsided</li>
    <li> Very hard to remove from dentures the hold wasnt good.</li>
    <li> I cannot figure out why I can&#x27;t get cushion grip in the walmart anymore.  It is such good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I recieved it in record time so am happy...nadine</li>
    <li> This product is NOT the sticky, gooey mess that adheres to gums to hold teeth in place.  It is a soft, cushiony reline that makes them fit so perfectly that they no longer need to be &#x27;glued&#x27; in place.  It lasts much longer than stated on the package and does not have to be removed and replaced daily (as adhesives do.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is simple and easy to apply as long as the directions are followed.  I have found that it continues to &#x27;set&#x27; (gradually becoming more hardened) for the first 24-36 hours.  The final feel is something like a hard wax against the gums (though it is not nearly as fragile as wax.)  It is extremely comfortable. Removal is also easy (again, follow directions.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of us who cannot afford a trip to the dentist for a re-line every time gum erosion causes the fit to change, this product is a life-saver.  It is my go-to product as a home replacement for a soft reline and is the only product of its type that I have found anywhere. (I use Reline-It as a replacement for hard re-lines, but many similar products are sold.)</li>
    <li> I tried it and it doesn&#x27;t hold anything in place but sure does make a mess! I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again!</li>
    <li> First off I would not call this adhesive. It works good to use it at night before bed. I put in warm water till soft, roll it like a worm and sit it in the denture. Close my mouth till comfortable not tight.  It feels warm at first  and I try not to clamp my teeth or move my mouth much. In the morning dentures come right out not stuck at all. If product overflowed above denture I gently trim it. After that I use my regular adhesive and dentures fit great. You take them out wash and put back in with your reg adhesive for four or five days till the Cushion Grip starts coming loose.  Soak dentures in warm water and you can work the old Cushion Grip loose in one piece. I would only recommend for people that have really loose dentures as a temp fix.  It does need to be used with reg adhesive because Cushion Grip is not an true adhesive, just builds up and fills in dentures.</li>
    <li> sticks well and helps line poorly fitting dentures. only drawback is price. too expensive for daily use.  but it does work well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years, it&#x27;s a little work applying and removing but it is the best fit you can get, your gums change all the time - this product gives you a constant good fit</li>
    <li> Awesome!!! I used this just on my lower denture and it has changed my life!!! I have such a problem with my lower denture making sore spots and moving around while I try to eat and this product makes them stay put and is super comfortable. I tried it on my top but it would not keep them in place so I just use sea bond for that. I just had my extractions 3 weeks ago and I am using this. I give this 4 thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Surprised to read all the positive reviews.  Perhaps I received one that&#x27;s expired.. the hot water bath did not soften it, what comes out is very hard to manipulate dry, firm glue-like substance. Oh, and there was no key in the pack.</li>
    <li> They claim is will hold for four (4) days!  It didn&#x27;t hold for four (4) minutes!!!!  Total waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> This stuff will last about one meal for me. Then it turns loose. I will keep searching for something more permanant</li>
    <li> I  could not believe how VERY expensive it has gotten.  Not long ago AT ALL, I could buy it at C.V.S. drugstores for about $7.00 or $8.00. And now you want 98.00. That makes no sense. I will never  buy it again and I really liked using it&lt;br /&gt;. Sorry cushion grip you have lost another customer. P. Boone</li>
    <li> I have such mixed results from this product.  Before Thanksgiving  I used it and one application lasted  till Christmas.  The next application was awful and I went back to paste adhesives.  Just tried again, and seems fine.  When it works it is great but many times I do it wrong, too much or too little and have to scrap it all off and start over.</li>
    <li> very expensive thought I was getting 4 cushion grip for the price I paid</li>
    <li> I have tried this many times. After reading all, and I mean ALL, the reviews I was super excited to try but after 5 failed attempt I give up. Before you start saying I must have done it wrong, I have news from you. I watched video after video on youtube, read every single review and have done it EXACRLY like I was suppose to and it just DOES NOT WORK for me. The one review I followed was from one on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes,, put a hairdryer and tube of cushion grip in the sink on HOT for 1 minute and it heats up the tube and dentures for easier application.&lt;br /&gt;Well,, DON&#x27;T DO IT!! Not only was it HOT ( she did say it would be) but what she failed to mention was that it would melt the cap and when opened it would spew out everywhere which led to half a tube in my bathroom floor. I was so hoping this would be a easy/temporary fix for me but after spending a hour trying to scrape it off,,,,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to my dentist..</li>
    <li> This product works well with upper dentures, only so so for lowers,I believe it is because of the irregulay gums</li>
    <li> As a cheap I&#x27;m out of everything this is ok but it&#x27;s very gritty and takes about 20 minutes just to get it to stop wiggling n stay put. I only have a cover so this may be different for full or partial dentures but for my cover purposes this tasted funky and wouldn&#x27;t stay put until I pressed for awhile</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever to accompany dentures</li>
    <li> Price is ridiculous for all it does. And it doesn&#x27;t last as long as others reviews said</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about everything and keep coming back to this. It took awhile to get used to how much to use. To much and you will be chewing on it.</li>
    <li> I sometimes get popcorn hulls under my lower plate, and I use Cushion Grip to help with the tenderness. Works great! This product is not available everywhere, so I was happy to find it on Amazon. Received on time promised, and in great condition. Remember to follow the directions exactly or you wont be satisfied.</li>
    <li> Works good.  Too bad it is so hard to find anymore.</li>
    <li> seem to do the job as advertised.I however need more time to come to a positive conclusion as to the true value of this item.</li>
    <li> unbeleivable.  I wanted to throw my denture away. I got a reline and insurance wouldn&lt;br /&gt;t do another for 6 months.  Now I may not let my dentist touch my denture again.&lt;br /&gt;Use very hot water.&lt;br /&gt;Good for a month with nightly soaking in polident.  I use a small amount of powder adhesive as well for a gripping fit.&lt;br /&gt;Roy Thornton</li>
    <li> This product has been discontinued by the manufacturer.  I hated paying the price but I needed it so I bought it.  I wish another company would pick this product up and start making it at the original price of under $10.00.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product but WAY TO EXPENSIVE I CANNOT AFFORD TO BUY ANYMORE 😩</li>
    <li> Had to use twice as much as what instructions specified, but may be because my dentures were extremely loose.  In my case adding a small amount of dental adhesive with it worked for me and lasted about a week.  When I used dental adhesive alone, it would ooze out and make me gag and only could keep them in for about 4 hours.  At least with Cushion Grip with adhesive, I could go all day without any problem including eating.  It does get a lot harder as it gets older and somewhat hard to remove.  This product is definitely worth trying if adhesive alone does not do the job.  Degree of success will vary with each person.  It gets me by until I can get a reline done at my dentists office.</li>
    <li> I used this product a couple of times, but found, while eating or drinking, I could feel the adhesive coming out the back of the plate on the roof of my mouth.  It seems to work fairly well until you eat or drink.</li>
    <li> I do not remember anymore what the problem was, but I did follow the rather-elaborate instructions in applying the adhesive but my upper denture just did not feel nearly as secure as it did when I used either Super Poli-grip or Secure, so I sent the product back to the seller and received a refund for it. I will stick to Secure from now on. As long as I am satisfied with it, why try anything else?</li>
    <li> UPDATE - MAY 14, 2014&lt;br /&gt;Been using it for 2 weeks. Love it. Unbeatable comfort. Already ordered/rcvd an additional 2-pack. Just did a new application. It&#x27;s time to take the denture out and let it sit but I don&#x27;t want to remove it because it feels great. Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer says that 1 application lasts up to 4 days. It does harden over time, but it lasts much longer than 4 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The inside of my denture is rough so Cushion Grip clings tenaciously, especially in the front and takes a lot of time and patience to remove. For the zillion frustrating, tiny bits of residue, I use an alcohol-soaked soft toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, Cushion Grip sticks to nail polish. During application, if it finds a good edge it will lift polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of removal issues, Cushion Grip is worth its weight in gold. I now have a painless denture, I can eat crunchy food, no more sore gums and I can even whistle again. I can&#x27;t vouche for lowers but I highly recommend this product to anyone with a loose and/or painful upper denture. Deserves 10 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My denture is very loose &amp; causes constant pain. (had several professional relines/used home kits, etc.) I was given a tube of Cushion Grip yesterday (4/29/14). The results are dramatic. Less bulk &amp; more cushion than a professional soft reline. I no longer feel pain or discomfort. First thing I ate with Cushion Grip? PEANUTS. No other adhesive used and no pain, slipping or wobbling. When I remove my denture and put it back in, initially it seems that it won&#x27;t reseal but it does, beautifully. I will be purchasing a LOT of this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those trying Cushion Grip for the first time:&lt;br /&gt;- take your time and apply evenly, whether you use balls or strings. (It&#x27;s strings for me.)&lt;br /&gt;- don&#x27;t go overboard smoothing it out. It will mold to your mouth when you bite.&lt;br /&gt;- apply what seems like a SMALL amount for the initial mold. You can build up afterward for a perfect fit.&lt;br /&gt;- Spill-over helps the seal so try not to trim it. Also, you can feel edges if you don&#x27;t trim perfectly.ems like a SMALL amount for the initial mold.

    <li> expensive but in great time</li>
    <li> I had been fighting poorly fitting dentures--no matter what the dentist did they ate up my gums.  My husband found this product on Amazon and suggested I try it.  It really does work.  I have relief for the first time in five months.  I do use a thicker coat than called for in the instructions.  It is difficult to remove--just keep soaking in hot water and it finally all comes out.  Worth the hassle and will be reordering soon.</li>
    <li> Cushion Grip stands head and shoulders above any other denture adhesive. Give it a try, you will never go back to the goos, powders or wafers. The only disadvantage is that it isn&#x27;t available in brick and mortar stores.</li>
    <li> It has quadrupled plus in price, since my last purchase,  December 2014.  Wondering why!</li>
    <li> My husband tried this product following all directions to perfection and it didn&#x27;t hold worth nothing on four or five tries.  Broke loose on the first bite.  Was very easy to clean out of the plate, just peeled right out.  Then to add insult to injury, at our local pharmacy, he saw the same product listed here for under $7.00.  So how can Amazon allow this company to rip people off like this?  Isn&#x27;t there some type of due diligence conducted on products?  This is the worst product I have ever bought on Amazon.  My experience generally with Amazon is outstanding, but this one really sucks big time.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this stuff. Prior to using this I was able to wear my uppers gooped up with adhesive. I couldn&#x27;t wear the lowers. I&#x27;d force myself to wear the lowers for certain occasions but they were miserable.&lt;br /&gt; I followed the directions on the paper insert and was able to wear my lowers all day for the first time since I&#x27;ve had them.&lt;br /&gt;They did loosen pretty quickly. The Cushion grip molds to your gums but is not an adhesive. It made my dentures immensely more comfortable so I dabbed some regular adhesive on them and omg, it was perfect. Wore both plates all day. No sore spots. No having to reapply. Perfection.&lt;br /&gt;I intend to try the hair dryer method mentioned in another review to get more use out of one application. The little tube does not seem to go far with frequent applications to 2 plates.  And i have yet to have it all come off neatly in one piece but I think overall I have found a product that really allows me to finally eat like a normal human and feel almost normal again. I have only had dentures for 3 months and I think I hadn&#x27;t actually been able to use the awful things to bite before this.</li>
    <li> Its good but just  a handful of bucks (at most)  These prices are joke, these used to cost around 7 bucks , well thats what uou pay for something that is going to feel better for hours . , I have no idea what who is buying this at these prices , but i wouldnt unless lost half of my brains cells</li>
    <li> Everyone&#x27;s dentures wear down and so do the gums, but with Cushion Grip you can make the dentures fit tight again and delay having to have new dentures made.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and wouldn&#x27;t be without it!</li>
    <li> This was a complete waste of my money. I don&#x27;t know who came up with this masochistic product. It tasted toxic. I&#x27;m talking straight chemicals and it was so gooey I couldn&#x27;t even manage to get it out of my mouth in time to *not* taste it. It reminded me of that gooey chemical kids toy that you&#x27;d ball up and put on the end of a straw and blow iridescent bubbles with TIMES 100!! Don&#x27;t bother *Note: I set aside in my bathroom drawer and a month later noticed that it had seeped out of its metal tube all over everything. Was its chemicals just it hing to escape? Scary.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and found it very comfortable, but extremely difficult to remove from my dentures.  After about 3 weeks I developed small sharp protrusions on my dentures where I believe this was penetrating them.  I do believe this was probably as the result of the age of my dentures (10+years).  Perhaps I&#x27;ll give it another shot when I get new dentures, but for now its not on my list of things to buy.</li>
    <li> i am really impressed by what this stuff is able to do,it is easy to work with and is miles ahead of anything else iv&#x27;e tried for making loose dentures fit better and more comfortably,anyone who has never tried it and is having trouble with poor fitting dentures don&#x27;t hesitate to give this a shot,its really amazing</li>
    <li> I have Full uppers and a lower &amp;#34;bridge. The instructions were easy to follow and apply.&lt;br /&gt;I warmed up the tube in my morning coffee. Perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest that you Remember to DRY the tube so your fingers aren&#x27;t damp. Worked SO well on my Uppers that I couldn&#x27;t get em OFF for Three days ;&amp;#62; Didn&#x27;t work for my lower bridge though. Gotta say, it&#x27;s really nice not feeling like I&#x27;ve got HARD Plastic against mah gums.</li>
    <li> this is a good product, it&#x27;s time consumimg and the directions have to be followed exactly&lt;br /&gt;and then MAYBE they would it will stick for one day</li>
    <li> I love this product, makes wearing dentures so much more comfortable. If you are having trouble with the pain of mouth sores or loose fitting dentures you will want to give this a try !!!!</li>
    <li> Cushion Grip is WAY BETTER than all the other denture adhesives. The only thing is that it cost a bit much. Is there any way the price can come down some.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You for allowing me to rate &amp; write a review on Cushion Grip.</li>
    <li> The best thing I&#x27;ve tried &amp; it works really well. I&#x27;ve tried other products &amp; this one works the best for me...I used to buy it in stores but can&#x27;t find it anymore so I just order from Amazon &amp; it doesn&#x27;t take long at all to get your order.</li>
    <li> This is without a doubt the best item I have found for the issue of keep dentures in place.  It is not an adhesive but rather a soft liner for your dentures.  Clean your dentures, dry them well and apply Cushion Grip according to instructions.  I have been using one treatment on my upper plate for a month at a time and one application for my lowers every two weeks.  I creates a nice, secure suction to the upper palate and gums without the need for messy, hard to remove adhesives.  I keep about 6 tubes in stock.  It does take a little effort to clean the old liner material from your dentures but if you warm your dentures in very hot water for a few minutes, it will peel off with a little effort.  It is a thermoplastic that once applied sets up and nicely form fits your uppers and lowers.  I have no problems with food particles getting in between my gums and plate.  I eat pretty much what ever I want.  I haven&#x27;t tried corn on the cob yet or apples but everything else has been pretty good.  If you haven&#x27;t tried Cushion Grip then you owe it to yourself to do so.  Once you do, you will find that nothing else even comes close.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a dirty shame that I, had to PAY over 68.00 DOLLARS for this product. I guess somebody has to get rich. It used to be 7.99 a tube, get my friends, get rich!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Lots of good reviews on this product, didnt work for me at all,</li>
    <li> The only product of this type that really works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Great product but price is getting out of reach</li>
    <li> Terrible taste. Terrible cushion. Feels like a big wad of sticky, foul tasting chewing gum stuck to my plate. Mashed on my gums. Rubs. Tried a second time, just in case, with less product on the plate. Still yuk! I will not be using this product again.</li>
    <li> My dentures stayed in for 10 minutes. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS  BEFORE AND I LOVE IT. I COULD NOT FIND IT AT ANY STORE. I&#x27;M SO GLAD I FOUND IT.</li>
    <li> Best product I have ever used,no more loose dentures and most of all no more need for polygrip. Teeth feel tight&lt;br /&gt;and secure.If used as directed you should have no problem.Try it you may like it.</li>
    <li> This product really works great!! A lot less expensive than getting a reline! Easy to use, and easy directions to follow!!</li>
    <li> I gave this a one star because of this.  Many, many reviews about this product gave it a five star.  I recently had a full lower plate done over the summer.  I was looking for a better grip than the Secure Denture Adhesive.  It would really be nice to have the lower plate stay secure in my mouth for 4 days (as the manufacture says).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I got the Cushion Grip in the mail at evening time and I was very excited.  I decided to wait until the next day to try it.  I read the instruction over a couple of times so I could get a clear understanding of how to get the optimal use.  I followed the directions to a &amp;#34;t&amp;#34;.  When I left the house, within 10 minutes of leaving the house I felt the lowers loose.  I was mad so I pulled (no, took) them out of my mouth.  (They were that loose).  I was so mad!!!  After calming down a bit, I decided maybe it was something I over looked.  After all it could be human error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day I made sure that I followed the instructions, again to a &amp;#34;t&amp;#34;.  This time I put just a little bit more of the stuff in the groove of the lower plate.  I bit down to get a secure seal and I kept biting for close to 1/2 hour.  I want this product to work so well.  Well, when I got to work, I was on the telephone talking and felt that I could not talk right because the lower plate was once again loose.  And I was just able to take the plate out of my mouth!!!</li>
    <li> BEEN USEING IT FOR 8 YRS  I  KEEP TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING ELSE THAT WORKS  BUT TO NO  A A</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this one and it let me down. I think the positive feed backs are from the manufactor friends or something to make it sell. Do not waste your money on this one. The liner came out everythime I took the dentures out.</li>
    <li> Great product that is no more !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been discontinued through sales of companies. After some research this is what I&#x27;ve found: SCHERING-PLOUGH sold to Merck Pharmaceutical along with the Cushion Grip product Then Merck Pharmaceutical sold their over the counter products to Bayer AG for over $14 Billion dollars in October 2014. Somewhere during the Merck ownership or after Bayer acquisition, Cushion Grip has been discontinued. Why you are seeing the price hike is because when it is sold out it is gone sort of like the old supply and demand, The only thing I can think to do is to contact Bayer AG to encourage them to once again manufacture Cushion Grip. For Facebook users Bayer AG has a facebook page that might be the place to start.</li>
    <li> This product is pure garbage! Did nothing for me. If you buy this trash you&#x27;re almost guaranteed to have your dentures fall out! Save yourself the embarrassment.</li>
    <li> I paid $65.00 for one tube.That is outrageous. The product Is very good. I used to buy at a local drugstore for $7.95 a tube.</li>
    <li> I had to try this after reading its description.  My denture comfort liner had come off (as my orthodontist said it would) and I couldn&#x27;t afford an airline trip to have him reline my upper denture.  I was tired of my denture cream liquefying on me, and replacing the cream at least twice a day to keep my dentures comfortable.  Even after I faithfully followed the instructions, I got poor results.  It felt like I had a liquefying gummy worm candy in my dentures after several hours...and, much to my surprise, the stuff came off in a gooey mass.  I even tried letting the cream air out on my dentures--it&#x27;s an effort, just getting the cream out of the tube--hoping that exposure to air might mean better results, but that didn&#x27;t work either.</li>
    <li> Didn&amp;#34;t last as long as I expected. Did OK the First time I used it ---For 1 day. Will use it again but doubt if I will order it again.</li>
    <li> Arrived early, exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Package was damaged, taste is so disgusting and is a mess when trying to clean dentures, I also noticed it burn your gums when trying to fit. Out of fear of damaging my gums it got tossed. another one on my do not order ever again list lol</li>
    <li> Only product like it that I&#x27;ve found and it works. 1/2 inch glob on the lower denture, spread it out evenly, insert denture, and your done!</li>
    <li> Did not work well for my lower plates, however it did work.  I have not tried the upper plates yet.</li>
    <li> Held my father&#x27;s teeth in for a short period of time, then they released their strength on the gums and my dad needed to use more. He finally gave up and we paid a couple thousand to put some crowns in.&lt;br /&gt;Temporary solution and when i mean temporary i mean a few hours. Goodluck</li>
    <li> I like the product, but it is way over priced compared to what I found it for after I ordered from you.</li>
    <li> Did not hold as well as I expected.  Went back to my old brand.  I tried twice, following the directions, to get this to work.  Finally threw it in the garbage.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I can eat whatever I want now. I will be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> Well this stuff did what the dentist couldn&#x27;t,I can wear them!!! In fact I sometimes forget to take them out,If you have dentures that just don&#x27;t fit or rock get this stuff now!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have lost teeth from my dentures in the worst places.&lt;br /&gt;By keeping this handy to put it back in position no one knew.</li>
    <li> I thought I was ordering 4, 1 oz tubes for $22. Turns out it was only one tube. I paid 4 times the amount for the product! I won&#x27;t be using Amazon again! !!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an excellent product!</li>
    <li> BEST !! why can&#x27;t I buy it any more???</li>
    <li> Cushion grip really works. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 10 years. Then they took it off the shelves of the Wal-mart stores last year. I&#x27;ve been searching for this product for about a year now. I am so glad that Amazon has it online. I order me six tubes for only twenty-three dollars and that is great. I will be ordering some more just in case Amazon might run out.. But Cushion Grip really works and your gums do not be sore. It does just what it says, it gives your mouth a Cushion Grip.</li>
    <li> THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST DENTURE ADHESIVE I HAVE EVER FOUND. YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY TRY IT IF YOU USE ANY TYPE OF DENTURE CREAM.</li>
    <li> Since I have to use this product anyway, it&#x27;s much cheaper and way more convenient to order it on line instead of at the local drug store.</li>
    <li> I was in CVS Pharmacy and saw this Cushion Grip.  The store employee didn&#x27;t know anything about it but I purchased it anyway because I was desperate. There isn&#x27;t anything worse than loose fitting dentures and adhesive that doesn&#x27;t work. I paid double the price of Amazon.com&#x27;s price.  Took it home and tried it and had trouble so I called Schering-Plough, the drug company&#x27;s customer service.  The number is on the internet under Schering-Plough.com and they gave me additional instructions on how to use it and were very nice. I gave it another try and yes it did burn just a little bit but I didn&#x27;t let that bother me and kept my dentures in that night for the first time since I got them.  I was amazed.  I haven&#x27;t been able to eat right since I got my dentures 3 years ago and now I can eat anything.  I have had 2 sets of dentures and they both have not fit right.  Now I think I am going to be able to use Cushion Grip without any trouble.  I&#x27;m glad I found it and I will be ordering it from Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Tried several other OTC adhesives, this one beats them all short of lab-quality reliner such as those from Perma-Soft. Here are the instructions for use, since I always seem to mislay the insert:    How to apply Cushion Grip Denture Adhesive:    1. Warm the capped tube in hot tap water (not boiling) for 5 minutes. This makes Cushion Grip easier to apply.    2. Use the key. Attach enclosed slotted key to end of warm Cushion Grip tube. Turn key carefully squeezing out a ball of Cushion Grip 3/4 inch in diameter.    3. Apply to lower denture first. It&#x27;s important to first seat your upper denture in your mouth without Cushion Grip on it. The lower plate must be thoroughly clean and dry. On lower plate start the Cushion Grip ball at one end of the gum groove. Spread ball with fingers until entire groove is covered with a thin, even layer of Cushion Grip. Press layer firmly to plate. Let set for 5 minutes. Then put in lower denture and bite firmly.    4. ...then apply to upper denture.  Plate must be thoroughly clean and dry. With fingers, spread Cushion Grip ball from one end of gum groove to the other in a thin even layer. Be sure to cover entire back edge of upper plate with a thin layer of Cushion Grip. Press layer firmly to plate. Wait 5 minutes. Then inserting upper denture, press against front gum. Then, with thumb push up firmly to roof of mouth. Complete the seal by biting down firmly.     5. If you don&#x27;t get enough Cushion Grip on your plates the first try, dry plate and apply more over the first layer.    To remove Cushion Grip Denture Adhesive:    Soak plates in hot (not boiling) water for ten minutes to soften old Cushion Grip application. Peel away the warm Cushion Grip from dentures with fingers or a wood manicure stick. A new application gives better results on a clean denture surface.</li>
    <li> You gotta have this stuff if you wear Dr. Bailey&#x27;s Secure Smile teeth. It holds the teeth securely in place, and is so comfortable, you forget you are wearing false teeth.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do a great deal to keep my dentures in place, it doesn&#x27;t make them more comfortable, and it&#x27;s aggravating to remove.  I can recommend that you don&#x27;t wrap them in a towel with the hair dryer; it&#x27;s disastrous, but it does peel off easily when it cools down enough to touch.  I threw the remains of that tube away and bought more at the local CVC.  I made sure to follow the instructions exactly in the next application, and it went on like a dream.  It didn&#x27;t do anything else I&#x27;d hoped, though, and it is the very devil to scrape off the inside of dentures.  Other people like it, but I wouldn&#x27;t bother buying it again.  The &#x27;Secure&#x27; denture cream is what holds dentures in place, I think.</li>
    <li> It worked really well as a cushion but it does not come off of the denture easily.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me. Waste of my hard earned money. I am sorry I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;Please do not purchase this junk.</li>
    <li> There must be a law protecting consumers from companies doing what Cushion Grip has done with the price of their product suddenly. I won&#x27;t be using it any longer because I can not afford it. I will  tell you this. I am going to do everything under my power to be sure this company gets what they deserve. I am going to spend my endless days complaining on google, Amazon and Ebay for what they have done. If you were smart, you would dump them too. I&#x27;ll use a temporary liner until I can have an adjustment made. Seeing a pemanant adjustment is around 250.00....Why the hell anyone would pay this price is out of their mind! PLEASE PEOPLE, Joint the &amp;#34;NO CUSION GRIP BAND WAGON&amp;#34;. Dump these greedy jerks and find another product!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I paid more for this one tube, $21.44, than I did for 4 tubes previously.  This item doesn&#x27;t work as they stated, however it does help to keep dentures from rubbing sores on your gums.  I have shared this item with friends, and they have the same problem, dentures slipping.  I&#x27;m using this until my time to replace my dentures arrive.  Hopefully this one tube will carry me thru, I don&#x27;t want to pay this amount again.  Walgreens have the same item listed at $6.92 a 1oz tube, but out of stock.</li>
    <li> When this product warms up from the natural body temperature inside the mouth it softens &amp; oozes out all along the edges of my dentures. This happens in about 2-3 hours. I let cushion grip dry on dentures overnight &amp; the same thing happened the next day. It does not stay put on the denture &amp; does not stick at all. You have to use a denture adhesive as well. This product is expensive &amp; delivers sub-standard performance, making it a BIG WASTE OF MONEY!!!</li>
    <li> Works very well. Much better than any other product I have tried.</li>
    <li> Great product meets my expectations A-plus it will not disappoint you, kept tooth in place for days, don&#x27;t waste money on another product !</li>
    <li> I got my product within a week of ordering it . I was quite pleased . It is a kind of plastic paste which is perfect cuz it has no after taste unlike the one in the dollar store. It is also reusable.. You can actually take them out and clean them and the paste stays unless you peel it off . Just pop them in warm water and put them back in without another application which makes the product last long. Thanks</li>
    <li> This product does what it says. I purchased it twice. Satisfied with results. Make sure you read the instructions and use it accordingly.</li>
    <li> They fell out when He started to take a bite. He followed the direction. Product did not work!</li>
    <li> Too expensive. Now that it is getting scarce, everyone is goughing on the price.</li>
    <li> excellent, best I&#x27;ve ever used to keep my partial in place while eating even crunchy food.</li>
    <li> Everything was great shipping and product</li>
    <li> I had tried many products and this one worked extremely well.  I have ordered this many times. I will keep using this product as long as I need to.</li>
    <li> I just got immediate dentures about a month ago I&#x27;m 23 by the way and have been having so much trouble keeping my bottoms in.I tried the typical gooey adhesive,the power and thought I would try this since the reviews sounded like it really works.Well I got this expensive crap and it held for less than 5 minutes.I followed the instructions and tried multiple times but still no luck.Im better off with the powder.Dont waste your money please...</li>
    <li> Sorry, I do not like the Cushion Grip.. my friend uses it and loves it, but doesn&#x27;t work for me.. I do better with Fixodent...  This may be fine for others..</li>
    <li> Firstly the price of this product is outragous!, while I am partially to blame for not researching beforehand, I paid $22.95 Amazon Prime and then discovered the same product in a local CVS for $7.99, some markup!&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product goes, there were so many positive reviews I felt I just had to try it. If you follow the instructions it is relatively easy to apply. Managing to find the &#x27;right&#x27; amount to use is a challenge, the recommended amount oozes everywhere but it does actually grip pretty well.  I am still not convinced this is right for me but having found a much cheaper supply will persevere</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it has worked miracles for me. I could not wear my top denture without gagging. I was told about this by a friend and thought what the heck, and I love it I can actually wear my top dentures now and even eat with them in. great stuff, you gotta buy.</li>
    <li> This has to be one of the most difficult to use, ineffective, and over-priced products to come on the market in years.     First, it is difficult to apply. The instructions say to soak the tube in hot tap water for five minutes, and a key is supplied to put on the end of the tube to help you get the product out of the tube. It is still hard to get out, and you are going to have a lot of \\&quot;fun\\&quot; if you have weak, arthritic hands.     Second, it sticks very tenaciously to your dentures, but there is very little adhesion to the gums. It did not stick to my finger as I was spreading it over the dentures as instructed. I should have suspected it would not adhere to saliva covered gums.     Thirdly, and this is the worse part, removing it from your dentures. Imagine, if you will, melting a piece of your shower curtain in a frying pan and then trying to remove it without damaging the pan. That&#x27;s not really a good analogy because your frying pan has a flat surface while your dentures are full of little ridges and depressions.     I&#x27;m glad I only ordered one tube to try it. I probably used about a quarter of the tube in one application. That makes it pretty expensive even if it worked.</li>
    <li> This item was advertised to hold loose fitting in need of realigning dentures.  I used quite a bit to try to accomplish this and was unsuccessful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years on my bottom dentures, it adheres ti the denture and it isn&#x27;t slimy or &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34;  Love It!</li>
    <li> For more than ten years,I have tried every type of adhesive, but continued to gag and have the denture slip out.  This product shapes to the contours of my upper palate and stays secure for days.  It has a pleasant taste and stays put.  The other products slipped into my mouth and down my throat.  I was only 54 when I had to have my top teeth removed.  It was very tramatic. I wept the first time I saw myself  without teeth. I could only stand to wear them about 8 hours in a day.  With Cushion Grip I honestly can forget I have anything foreign in my mouth.  Thank you for a great product.  Joan Tufford</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for the perfect denture adhesive, look no further.   It takes a bit of trial and error but once you have it mastered, Cushion Grip is an excellent product. It took a couple of tries for me to get the perfect amount for the best hold. It works better than my expectations. There are a couple of things you should be prepared for. I don&#x27;t know if this is a problem for most users or if it&#x27;s a rare occurrence, but for the first fifteen minutes or so the adhesive burned my gums and palate. It&#x27;s definitely not unbearable but it did worry me that perhaps I was allergic to it. But I grinned and beared it (pardon the pun) and all was fine. No permanent injury.   Until it completely sets, some of it will ooze over the edges. I use a pair of manicure scissors to trim it until it sets. When it does set, its texture is sort of like a firm yet pliable rubber.  As far as its performance, I couldn&#x27;t be happier. When used properly it will fit perfectly to your gums and palate. It&#x27;s as if you&#x27;re getting a new soft liner every few days. I used the same application for four days, which is the maximum the company recommends. I soaked it every night which didn&#x27;t cause any deterioration in its holding ability. It holds so well that it takes quite a bit of effort to remove the denture. Removing the product from the denture is a breeze. It just peels right off in one piece.   I have completely abandoned all other forms of adhesives. Goodbye pastes, strips, powders and wafers. I love the fact that I can just pop my dentures in and be ready to go. If I want a midnight snack I no longer decide against it because I don&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of applying an adhesive. I guess I&#x27;ll be putting on some pounds!</li>
    <li> been using for years but  price went up cant use it as much as i need to thanks</li>
    <li> Good product,too expensive to reorder more later.</li>
    <li> My husband has used this brand to secure his dentures for years... he swears by it!  When he needs more, I&#x27;ll definitely buy more for him.</li>
    <li> I received this product damaged. Very disappointed to pay so much and it look like it did.</li>
    <li> For 3 weeks at a time they fit like they did when I first got them 15 years ago, really, the stuff lasts for up to 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> This product did well, it said it would hold for up to four days, the most I could get was three at the most.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money. Gets just as gooey as the past and lasted 1 day</li>
    <li> It squeezes out between dentures and is noticeable. It holds pretty well.</li>
    <li> It is a good product, a cushion, something like a reline but Not an Adhesive. It will make your dentures feel better but it&#x27;s not an Adhesive.</li>
    <li> This sounded so promising that I was really hopeful, but this is the absolute worst denture adhesive product on the market (and I&#x27;ve tried them all).  Not only does it take 15 minutes to follow the steps properly, but the first time that I put anything into my mouth to chew both top and bottom fell out. Not came loose - actually fell out.  I guess there is one positive - you don&#x27;t have to scrape it out of your mouth because it absolutely does not stick.</li>
    <li> I checked for the ingredients and hard to believe there is Fluoride in there .... why I ever would I like to put such a toxic substance into my mouth ... I am happy that we do not have this poison in our drinking water where we are living ... read about Fluoride and get away from this poison ... filter your water and do not put it in your mouth ...</li>
    <li> I love not having to scrape that gooey mess off the roof of my mouth...you just peel this stuff off your dentures. the only thing that would make it better is if you didn&#x27;t have to warm it up to get it out of the tube!</li>
    <li> Worked well making my dentures fit better and more comfortably until I get a realingnment. I still need cream to help stick but you may not. Overall the product works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> My son told me about this a few years ago. It took me a few times to get5 everything applied correctly but WOW, what a difference. Walmart does not carry it anymore and I have not been able to find it anywhere except on the internet. I will pay what ever the cost is for something that works. Cushion Grip does wonders. I&#x27;m cheap I guess cause I get almost a month on each application. I brush the teeth everyday and soak them once a week and Cushion Grip keeps on working.</li>
    <li> It does what it claims it will do.  The more times you apply the material you get better with the application and find you can use less with better results.  It improved the stabalization of my upper and lower plates.  Would recommend to others.  Bob Zee</li>
    <li> it work good but dont know how to use it really need more practice</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find anymore Thank you This stuff is wonderful. Only thing that works</li>
    <li> IF YOU HAVE ILL FITTING DENTURES, OR YOU ARE A NEW DENTURE WEARER, THIS PRODUCT WILL BE SO HELPFUL TO YOU. IF YOUR IN NEED OF A NEW LINER AND CAN&#x27;T AFFORD ONE, THIS IS A TEMP FIX. IF YOUR GOING THROUGH YOUR EXTRACTIONS AND SOFT LINERS, THIS PRODUCT WILL HELP TO FIT YOUR DENTURES BETWEEN SOFT LINERS, AND KEEP THEM FROM SLIPPING AROUND AND RUBBING SORE SPOTS ON YOUR GUMS. I WOULDN&#x27;T USE ANYTHING ELSE!</li>
    <li> This stuff is not at all what I expected after reading all the good reviews before purchase. It was hard to work with and it became a complete and utter mess.&lt;br /&gt;Trying to remove it was a horror. I am glad I only purchased one Tube (which by the way went into the Trash Can)</li>
    <li> the product was great, what is wrong is taking advantage of people that really need this by charging double the amount. I hope and pray and I mean this that no one ever does this to you. without this product I could not go to work.</li>
    <li> Cushion grip works GREAT.</li>
    <li> the best denture adhesive i have used.</li>
    <li> I would like to know why the price went up over 300 present since the last time I purchased it</li>
    <li> This is by far the best adhesive I have tried.  Using conventional adhesive, I had to re-apply before and after each meal, and sometimes even during the meal.  But I have found that Cushion Grip will hold all day, and often for a second day as well.  After the second day, I sometimes have to supplement it with a little conventional adhesive, but even then I get a much better hold than with the conventional adhesive alone.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and I am very disappointed that they are discontinuing it.  I also think the price has gotten prohibitive.</li>
    <li> If you have dentures that don&#x27;t fit well, this is the best solution!  It takes a while to get used to fitting it around the inside of the dentures but once you get the hang of it, it is really easy to use and it works wonders for holding in the bottom plates especially.  I love this product and will continue to purchase it as long as it is available!</li>
    <li> Not worth the cost to ship it. Does not do as advertised. Buyer Beware! Do not waste your money or time ordering it.</li>
    <li> Works great. I buy mine at Walgreens and they usually have it in stock. I have left it on my dentures for up to six weeks at a time before I have removed and reapplied it. I soak my dentures nightly and it does not effect the fit or cushion. Best product I have found for my comfort.</li>
    <li> works great for my lowers</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for adding a lining to loose fitting dentures. Holds well and is comfortable. Great idea!would highly reccommend. Also,a tip-put dab in dentures,heat with blow dryer a few seconds, then mold . This is faster and works well for me.</li>
    <li> I do not hate the product I hate the price and will not buy this again from Amazon</li>
    <li> Very happy , my botom teeth I had problems with them staying in plus when ever I ate they would rock and make raw spots on the inside of my gum . But with this product is wonderful my teeth no longer rock and they even stay in , so far it&#x27;s been four day that they stay in and it feels like a sift cushoin I love it , the seller was fast delivery and I have no complaints that you so much</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this for years and loves it.  I stumbled across it accidently for him and found that it did the job great and is not a daily reliner for his denture.  You can leave it on for days to 2 weeks.  He started using this in 1975 in PA. and moved to FL in 1983.  He almost had a kitten when we had trouble finding it in FL though it has gotten worse over the last few years to find it.  I was very happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This denture thermoplastic, can be used by everyone,its like a soft reliner for your dentures last about 4weeks no bad taste no messy cream great for eating.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent, and easy to use.  I read so many reports about it being hard to use.  I found just the opposite.  Just heat the tube up in hot(not boiling) water, and it is very easy to apply.  It will last at least 4 days and makes my dentures so secure, I can even sleep in them with no problem.  My dentures are very loose, so without cushion grip, they would be impossible to wear.  All I use is some extra hold powder adhesive, and I am good to go.  Recommend this product very highly.</li>
    <li> Nice product but after many trials, opted for another adhesive product.  Although CUSHION GRIP is  a good product, it takes second place, in my opinion, to EFFERGRIP.  Why?  Well, CUSHION grip requires placing tube in hot water for about 5 or so minutes and then applying to dentures.  Besides, it costs a lot more than the EFFERGRIP.  For some folks, this could be seen as okay because CUSHION GRIP doesn&#x27;t need to be applied every day but maybe every 3-5 days while EFFERGRIP requires daily application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the ease of use of EFFERGRIP makes it the top choice, in my humble opinion.</li>
    <li> This stuff is horrible.  It lasted all of 10 minutes and it peeled right off.  Very disappointed and will not buy again or recommend.</li>
    <li> If I have to use anything, this is the best.  It lasts a long time and is not sticky or distasteful.  I can wash my denture and&lt;br /&gt;it still stays put.  They ship is fast and at no charge.  I think it is a great option.</li>
    <li> great product and best in the market will recomend to other users. Easy to apply and the with the small tool.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, &amp; thank God I only needed it temporarily, as all amazon sellers are price gouging on it because it&#x27;s being discontinued!</li>
    <li> said pack of 4, only got 1.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cushin Grip for 15 years. I love this product and I will always use this. I&#x27;ve tried others. They ooze and disappear with in just a few hours. Cushin Grip lasts for days and days. Especially with all the over night soaking products. It stays where you apply to your dentures. Plus while using any and all tooth brushes. Cuship Grip continues to Grip the dentures. Cushin Grip stays inplace and is very soft and shapes to your jaw.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t worth the money</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.  Exactly what was expected.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised. Great reviews were on target. Will purchase in future. Best on market in my opinion. please try.</li>
    <li> I have used cushion grip for years, Bi-Mart used to carry it, but for some reason stopped.&lt;br /&gt; I could not wear my dentures without it. It is soft and pliable. I used everything I could find and cushion grip works best for me.</li>
    <li> Cushion Grip has made my between-visits to my dentist bearable, since I have a two-hour drive to and from for each visit. I was happy to discover this product.</li>
    <li> There is no doubt that loss of teeth requiring a denture, is an infirmity. If one is too old or cannot afford to consider multiple tooth implants, one&#x27;s only solution is to wear dentures.&lt;br /&gt;In my case about 3 months ago, I lost all my upper teeth, and have tried to survive with complete upper dentures.&lt;br /&gt;The dentures I got look much better than my own teeth for the last 20 years, but trying to enjoy life with them is not easy.&lt;br /&gt;After overcoming a short period of depression, I have tried several products, and I was lucky to find Cushion Grip advertised at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Everything I tried to use at first worked only for a few hours, even after doing a soft reline on my denture, which was very helpful. I found that Polident powder was the best in this category of temporary denture adhesives, lasting less than a day.&lt;br /&gt;Before you read any further about Cushion Grip, I refer you to the excellent tutorial by echoscream.&lt;br /&gt;To this tutorial, I would like to add a few points which may be helpful to you.&lt;br /&gt;1. The state of one&#x27;s gums is constantly changing, shrinking, so that a reline and adjustment of the dentures has to be done by your dentist as needed, when the dentures get loose. You may learn to do the reline yourself with Prosoft, an excellent product and very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;2. With time, things will improve, as your gums get harder, and you learn how to use the various adhesives, so don&#x27;t despair.&lt;br /&gt;3. Consider the use of Cushion Grip, as a soft reline, lasting a few days, in contrast with the soft reline with Prosoft, which may last a few months.&lt;br /&gt;4. When you apply your dentures using Cushion Grip, give the dentures a while, before you eat, so that the temperature in your mouth helps mold Cushion Grip to your gums, and hold the dentures in place. At lest 1-2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;5. Use as little Cushion Grip as necessary, by squeezing the pea size glue into thin rope like shape, which you will lay to the denture as per drawing.&lt;br /&gt;6. Look at the drawing that comes in the box, and make sure you surround as if in a circle the Palate part of your denture.&lt;br /&gt;Remember that if the palate is perfectly glued to the dome of your mouth, (sometimes even creating a sucker effect) your dentures will hold perfectly well, and last easily a few days.&lt;br /&gt;7. Remember that Cushion Grip is waterproof, so you can wash your mouth and use mouth wash, but use cold water.&lt;br /&gt;8. Warm to reasonably heated water as a mouth wash, will allow you to unglue your dentures easily in a couple of minutes, and wash them. You can probably reglue them without needing to start the process from the start.&lt;br /&gt;9. Removing the old adhesive, is very easy. Dip your dentures in warm water for a few minutes, and you will be able to peel of the membrane created by the adhesive.&lt;br /&gt;With my thanks to echoscream for his/hers very useful tutorial, I wish you luck with Cushion Grip.rawing that comes in the box, and make sure you surround as if in a circle the Palate part of your denture.&lt;br /&gt;Remember that if the palate is perfectly glued to the dome of your mouth, (sometimes even creating a sucker effect) your dentures will hold perfectly well, and last easily a few days.&lt;br /&gt;7.

    <li> This product is amazing! It makes my dentures for a lot better than they did. It makes them feel secure and I am able to eat things I couldn&#x27;t eat before!</li>
    <li> It worked very well but it is only a temporary fix and you should see a dentist to get a permanent realignment.</li>
    <li> I have used cushion grip for years, not sure why they removed it from the stores but glad I can still get it online. It works great, just follow the instructions</li>
    <li> I purchased another 6 tubes.  This works great and keeps my lower denture in place all day and through meals!</li>
    <li> I find it last a long time on the denture even with drinking or eating, as some paste wash away when drinking</li>
    <li> I have used Cushion Grip for several years and am generally satisfied with the results. This is the best price around</li>
    <li> It did cushion but it never worked all day for me on the lowers.</li>
    <li> really rip off this used to cost $6.00 a tube !!  talking about trying to make a buck</li>
    <li> Product works better than any other product available for dentures.  Why is it so difficult to find?</li>
    <li> My husband and my dentures are old and we both need new ones but the cushion grip helps us to be able to keep them in our mouth without them falling out and when we eat it helps to keep seeds and things out from under them.</li>
    <li> Ive never used it before took a friends advise and gave it a try, but its my thing, I&#x27;ll stick you my brand i use. God Bless wish you had a book on thngs you have to offer that i could show friends and see they might want to order or need if you do may i get one  Thank you Virginia Vargas</li>
    <li> this stuff feels great but doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like I do recommend it if you need an adjustment but cant get it done right away</li>
    <li> This is a great product -- if you have patience. To apply it to dentures, it needs to be warmed before squeezing from the tube and them molded with the fingers onto the denture. However, once you&#x27;ve done that -- IT&#x27;S WORTH IT. My denture stayed put for a week!</li>
    <li> After I knew what I was doing with this product, I like it.  I wasted almost half a tube before I knew what I was doing though.  It serves the same purpose as the product where you pour the liquid into the powder, stir, pour on your dentures, stick them in your mouth, and wait for so many minutes, take them out, and trim away excess -- but this is easier.  No mixing ,etc., - just  put on your dentures, spread around (I wet the tip of my finger and spread it or push it around would describe it better), and put them in your mouth and go.  Be sure and use it sparingly - a little seems to go a long way.  I used way to much the first time and had a mess.  It&#x27;s not the paste that you would use daily like I thought it was.  It&#x27;s kinda like a reline but softer and a LOT less expensive.</li>
    <li> Ok, do my aunt told me about this product I am amazed at the moment! She has been a faithful user of cushion grip for over 10 yrs! It took me a couple times to get it right, but once in, my dentures felt nice and tight and for awhile like I had real teeth again! But right now I am wearing temporary dentures, I just got my teeth pulled 6 weeks ago and I feel I had to use more then recommended being that my gums are still shrinking and I still have jokes where my teeth were pulled! I haven&#x27;t had my first relinment yet. That comes this coming week! So I have to say, I am scared to take my teeth out now because others here are complaining on how hard it is to remove the cushion grip from the dentures and from ur mouth as well! Now my aunt really didn&#x27;t complain of a problem there ethier. She said to just soak them in hot water and it comes off! I can&#x27;t see her using this product all those yes if it were that big of a pain! Although like I said I used more then recommended since my pallet is sore from the top denture rocking back and forth! Wow tho this product made me forget I am wearing dentures and my pallet is not hurting either!! I actually ate comfortabley tonight for the first time in 6 weeks of having my teeth pulled!! I&#x27;ll be ordering extra tubes from amazon that&#x27;s for sure!! Can&#x27;t wait to let my aunt know what a deal amazon has as well! Maybe the pain of removing the c grip will be worth it just to feel some what normal!!!</li>
    <li> putting ok on this for now  arrived on 6th like they said  but the box was open at both ends no seal on the item when take cap off either tube  has some lines and places in it where don;t know if done from shipping or  was tried and sent back  guess even  in that shape on opening for the lower dentures as  i can not wear them as they are cause of all the pain they cause</li>
    <li> product works well when tube is first heated in hot water to help the adhesive flow evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the price is very high. purchased two tubes in 2013 for 14.99 this one tube cost $29.00 with 6.99 for shipping...very high price????</li>
    <li> This product is a very effective soft liner for dentures that are loose after bone loss.  Be aware that the product will not adhere to a denture that already has a soft liner.</li>
    <li> I got this product for my wife.  She loves it and it works better than we thought it would.</li>
    <li> Great Product, hate that it is discontinued!</li>
    <li> I ordered the product for my mom. She had used it before (loves it) but was having trouble finding it in our local pharmacies. However, we found some later and it was half the price I paid for it online, so that was disappointing. Will not order again.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Dentures remain in all day and absolutely no mess when you take them out.</li>
    <li> It was sent as stated and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get the teeth prosthesis to work well as of yet but this adhesive seems to be good stuff.  Just with a preliminary test it worked well.  Nice little tube wringer with it.  Haven&#x27;t seen one of those in years.</li>
    <li> This stuff is very hard to work with. I have used the instant smile &amp; &amp;#34;secure smile&amp;#34; cosmetic veneers &amp; hoped this would work better than say polident. Anyone who buys the cosmetic teeth needs to modify them by removing the plate thing from the back &amp; grinding them down till they r almost see through. There is a detailed review by &#x27;Robert&#x27;  on the item &amp;I advise following it. They are great when you know what you have to do. Now as for an adhesive, this stuff stinks. I am quite handy as I have modified quite a few pair of the teeth to appear as real teeth. Again read his review. I bought this item and found it was not at all applicable to the cosmetic teeth, maybe because they are thin when fixed to fit but I used an entire tube trying to get the correct amount to do the holding job.&lt;br /&gt;I managed to get the veneers to stay on but in no time they came away from the placement.&lt;br /&gt;I believe it was because of the heat generated in the mouth &amp; remembering I was not using this product for DENTURES which I believe MAY work well for, I guess my lesson learned is you need a SECURE HOLDING DENTURE to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT try to use it for securing temp teeth. Polident works well as do the denture polident strips.&lt;br /&gt;Put it this way: If you want your temporary &amp;#34;costume&amp;#34; well modified teeth to work and look great, stick with any denture product which has the ability to both hold &#x27;em and harden (polident used w the powder not exposed to heat constantly will do this).&lt;br /&gt;Buying this product, at least for me and the folks I have helped was a waste of time and money.&lt;br /&gt;If someone has had success with this along with the *modified* instant smile type cosmetic teeth, please write a review.&lt;br /&gt;Polident, polident strips along w the powder is the way to go w these teeth.&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s not THIS PRODUCT EXACTLY - IT&#x27;S THE APPLICATION/USE OF IT you need to know about. Read the reviews of the teeth. The detailed descriptions of HOW TO are right on. Anyone who does not want to take the time to fit them-forget them. &amp; use an over the counter adhesive. If I try this again just because...I&#x27;ll revise and let you know.&lt;br /&gt;This may be great for normal actual dentures but for instant smile need to be modified teeth...Needs something I have yet to figure out... Stay away.e who does not want to take the time to fit them-forget them. &amp; use an over the counter adhesive. If I try this again just because...I&#x27;ll revise and let you know.&lt;br /&gt;This may be great for normal actual dentures but for instant smile need to be modified teeth...Needs something I have yet to figure out... Stay away.</li>
    <li> love it came on time and great packaging</li>
    <li> I love cushion grip. I would tell everyone to use it</li>
    <li> Nothing too amazing about cushion grip, simply holds well. I don&#x27;t know about wearing for more that 24 hours since I want to brush and clean my mouth and teeth daily anyway. The thing that most of us want is to keep food out from under the dentures, and to have some good cushioning betweet the gums. Thia product does both well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this is helpful, if so please check the appropriate box, Thanks.</li>
    <li> Fills in small area and no need for fix a dent. The taste is strong for a little while but that goes away, some tingle when first put in, but then again goes away quickly</li>
    <li> I find it difficult to rate a product I&#x27;ve never used.  I thought I&#x27;d need it with the Cosmetic teeth I purchased but it wasn&#x27;t necessary.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product several times in the past at REASONABLE prices.  The tubes used to sell for $6.97 and gradually increased, especially after EZO quit making their denture grip.  Is it good, yes, BUT the price is way above what is called gouging, it is ridiculous.  Considering you have to replace the liner every 3 or 4 days, add it up!  You would be better getting new dentures or relining.</li>
    <li> Cushion Grip  holds my teeth in place. I never have to worry about slippage. The strength of this product is truly amazing.&lt;br /&gt;After eight to ten long hours of work,shopping and relaxation,Cushion Grip still maintains a strong,reliable grip. Now,I&lt;br /&gt;can go about my busy day with a high degree of self-esteem .My physical appearance and my new smile go hand and hand.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You,&lt;br /&gt;NA</li>
    <li> No luck getting it to last more than one day. It just peels right off the partial denture.  So I am using it like a regular adhesive, applying it cold. It works that way for me but I only have an upper partial.  I hate throwing things away so I&#x27;ll use it up.  Compared to regular adhesive, none of it sticks to your gums when you remove the denture and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m ingesting any.  I think I should just go get a re-line.  My insurance covers it...duh.</li>
    <li> After using Cushion Grip for more than 5 years at less than $ 7.00 for a one Oz. tube,I find  it an absurdity to purchase the same one Oz tube for about  $ 20.00 . I will no longer be purchasing this item at  this ridiculous price.</li>
    <li> Hi,I got items,Thank you</li>
    <li> If u don&#x27;t like to have to scrape sticky residue off your gums this is the stuff for you!!! Easy to apply lasts for me up to 7days and removes easily. Doesn&#x27;t damage dentures. Again holds my dentures securely, no gunk to remove after you take them out and evens allows you to use denture soak, &amp; no nasty taste or no mint taste that makes everything taste minty;)</li>
    <li> this product does exactly what it says it does and if used correctly, will last even longer than it boast...</li>
    <li> I managed to keep my lower dentures in for part of a meal after applying this denture adhesive .  It certainly didn&#x27;t last the 4 days as promised.  The chemicals in this adhesive are somewhat caustic with the gums, just not a good product at all.  I&#x27;m throwing this product into the garbage, where it belongs.</li>
    <li> seam around the top of tube is starting to bulge ...t don&#x27;t think ill get as much lasting time .out of this tube ask have before......i understand this product is getting OBSOLITE  so ill just keep it &amp; be  satisfied</li>
    <li> Not as good as when I first started to use it. Of course that was about 30 yearsago</li>
    <li> the tube had a different label and when I first used it , there was a big bubble , so air in it.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise seems like the same cushion.&lt;br /&gt;The price was to much for it..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve TRIED many Denture Adhesives, even the pads. This product worked very well for cushioning and holding my dentures in place. The bottom one is the hardest and this product worked well.</li>
    <li> My Mother had ordered this from a book for many years. I told Her I would research Amazon to see if it was on here. To our delight we found and purchased it for her. She was delighted with her purchase through Amazon, since I did all the leg work in finding it she was delighted.</li>
    <li> i only got this product as my neighbor said it was great but it sucked as it did not work for me and it was just a waste of my money as i gave it to the neighbor that suggested i buy it maybe that is what they had in mind in the first place? I WILL NOT BE GETTING THIS EVER AGAIN AT LEAST FOR ME THAT IS!</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t as  easy to use as I had first thought, but it does hold, I&#x27;m just to big of a hurry, Time line sometimes makes it difficult to use.</li>
    <li> Just as good as everyone says. New to using dentures. I read directions and presto...great great great...thanks for all the great ratings.</li>
    <li> This works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. Use to buy this in stores, but now can only find online.</li>
    <li> ORDERED 3 TUBES TO TRY AND THREW THEM ALL OUT&lt;br /&gt;PRODUCT VERY HARD TO USE(HAVE TO USE HOT WATER @ MEASURE TEMP, EVERY BODY HAS A THERMOMETER)&lt;br /&gt;VERY MESSY AND TIME CONSUMING.&lt;br /&gt;OH WELL WE LEARN FROM OUR MISTAKES!!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great if you need something to get you by until you can afford a hard realign of your dentures. I think it says to change it out often but i would leave it in for often 2-3 weeks at a time before having to redo it. I have tried other products but they were horrible, especially the kind you have to pre mix yourself. Just so you know, when you first put it in your mouth you have to hold it in a while and for the first like 5 minutes it burns like crazy. Trust me, bite you teeth through it and you will be fine and you will have a great fit.</li>
    <li> i dont use it for dentures, i use it tofix hearing aid shells, works good.</li>
    <li> Order arrived by est. Time and was exactly as it was described</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, very good service from supplier. Product is tricky to use at first but we are learning. My husband age 82 had 2 teeth extracted, one of which supported his partial. CushionGrip made it possible for him to wear partial comfortably. It really does last 4-5 days!!</li>
    <li> Ok, so really I have had problems with my lower partial ever since I had a preemptive extraction on what was an anchor tooth for my bottom partial denture.  I understand that your mouth reshapes after something like this, but it has been 10 months, and I have been dealing with this.  Havebeen to my Periodontist and Dentist...not much help.  Eating has been hard, and I havebeen staying away from certain foods.  I started using a denture adhesive on that side, but soon after application, it started rocking around again.  (I did still have an anchor tooth on the other side of my mouth). Ok, so not really understanding the concept of cushion grip, since it is not really an adhesive...but having read all the positive reviews, and being desperate, I bought a tube on amazon.  I waited patiently, although the delivery did take a little more than I had thought and it arrived 2 days ago.  Followed the directions which were easy, although I think I could have allowed more time for the stuff to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34;...I allowed about 3 hours, cause I wanted to do it during the day and I was going out for dinner.  Did not want to have more denture issues out.  Ayway, the stuff was magic.  For the past 2 days I have been eating normally without using the adhesive gunk on my denture.  This stuff is kinda like the stuff they useto do your impressions when they make your denture, except it hardens while setting and then when you re-place the denture in your mouth, it now fits so well to your gums that it doesn&#x27;t rock around or pull out.  I am chewing gum (sugarless, of course) asI write and not once hasmy denture tried to suck out of my mouth.  I have not tried to remove the stuff yet, so cannot really speak to that but I read a review that talked about soaking it for 10 minutes in cold water and white vinegar.  Not a scientist, but since vinegar is very acidic, it makes sense to me that it might help soften this stuff up.  I don&#x27;t really care. Not having to deal with that adhesive every day is a blessing, as is the fact that I don&#x27;t seem to be having trouble eating.  I was so desperate I was even considering going into hock to get some implants, but have read negatives about those as well, not the least of which is $$$.  Thinking that this might  be must what I was looking for.  B T W, I applied it toboth sides of my partial (2 teeth on the side with an anchor and only one on the side where I lost the anchor tooth). Am sure I will get faster and more efficient doing the cushion gripping.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> After waiting for a month for the product to arrive, I was very disappointed with the claims made by the Product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is much worse than the normal denture adhesive I have been using.&lt;br /&gt;The product does not hold my lower partial denture at all, let alone holding it up to 4 days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides, the removal of the used product requires some effort on my part.</li>
    <li> excellent service and product.</li>
    <li> too difficult to work with</li>
    <li> The product doesn&#x27;t hold for more than a short time - it didn&#x27;t even make it to 1 hour let alone 4 days.  I followed the directions precisely, it burned like heck for over 5 minutes and let go after 22 minutes.  Not a product that I would consider purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Disliked the taste, and it did not work for me, I tried several times, thin, thick, layers back to poligrip</li>
    <li> If you wear dentures this is great,food or drink do not wash it away,I have tried others and they have washed away when I drink hot tea.I have recamended it to others</li>
    <li> works good got here quick is great product I will use it again I like it the price was good</li>
    <li> Takes some skill to apply it.  But as I get more and more skilled I expect to rave about it</li>
    <li> it is ok , helpt me many times</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t do without it</li>
    <li> if you don&#x27;t know what ur doing this stuff is very hard to use. My recommendation is don&#x27;t go cheap and go to your dentist for any repairs or re-alignment you have to get done. I was not happy with this product. Very,very hard to clean your dentures after you apply this crap on them. BEWARE.</li>
    <li> No, I was very dissatisfied on the price I was charged for product! I went to CVS pharmacy and paid $6.00 for what I bought on your website for $32.00!!!! That&#x27;s outrageous!!</li>
    <li> It does do exactly what it advertises.</li>
    <li> Just wanted to weigh in for those of us who wear partial dentures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been wearing my new partials for about 6 weeks, give or take a couple of days, and I had several adjustments to make them tolerable enough to eat anything more challenging that soup. I had some sore spots that could not be resolved without replacing my denture, which is a temporary. I couldn&#x27;t see going several days without my lower partial just to get another denture made with potentially the same problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After being told that we could make no further adjustments on my lower partial without sending it back to the lab, I got online and started researching. Cushion Grip is a top reviewed product on several sights, but I did not see any references to people using it on anything other than full dentures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to take a chance, closed my eyes and clicked &#x27;complete order&amp;#34; here on Amazon. My product arrived quickly and this weekend, I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions almost to the letter, with the exception that I started with a smaller amount than recommended. I have partial plates, both upper and lower. Since the directions were for full plates, I reduced the amount used by a little on the bottom and a lot on the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say this product is wonderful. It&#x27;s almost like gel insoles for your teeth! I had to make a few adjustments to account for high and low spots on my plates, but overall, I am extremely pleased. For example, I had severe bone loss in my lower front jaw even before my teeth were extracted. My partial does not sit properly in that area because there is almost no support. By adding extra Cushion Grip, I was able to balance this trouble spot and stabilize my bite. My upper plate did not particularly need the extra layer of cushioning, but I added a very thin layer there as well, and oh my! The plate was not specifically uncomfortable before, but it is so much better with the Cushion Grip that I decided to keep using it on my upper plate too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does not stick to my gums. It&#x27;s more like a layer of putty that molds to your particular soft tissues. It leaves a soft layer between your gums and your denture, eliminating the &amp;#34;sucky feeling&amp;#34; where things don&#x27;t quite come together correctly. It creates a tight seal with suction. The dentures feel slightly different when I remove or insert them because of the layer of &amp;#34;softness&amp;#34; there. It&#x27;s almost like coating them in a thin layer of rubber or gel, which has a touch of drag on my natural teeth, but makes a fantastic bond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one caveat I would state is that I would not use this immediately after having extractions. I would recommend toughing it out for at least a couple of weeks, and I would also recommend getting your adjustments. Some of my issues had to do with the denture being too tight, and with having a protrusion that needed to be smoothed down. I could not have remediated these issues with this product, and it does &amp;#34;ooze&amp;#34; to fit (although you can&#x27;t feel it), and I would have been very concerned about the suction pulling out my plugs in the new extraction sights, causing dry socket, if I had tried to use it to soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying more Cushion Grip, even after I get my permanent dentures. For those of you who have partials, this stuff is great!</li>
    <li> Great, my wife uses this product for years.</li>
    <li> I had tried several different products and none worked. I had met with my oral surgeon about installing 4 implants to secure my lower plate. This would have cost me over $20,000.00 and months of rehab. Before I did this I saw an ad for Cushion Grip and decided to give it a try. I am so glad I did. It has worked great. I am now able to eat without my lower plate giving me a problem. MY plate was new so it was not a problem with needing relining. After ordering one tube I placed a order for 5 tubes. I found that it is easy to remove then I thought it would be and it is easier to apply then I understood. I started using hot water to soften the gel but after a couple of applications I tried application with it cold. I found this to be almost as easy as applying ploy grip.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time and it is easy to reorder it  on Amazon. My favorite app. I love it.</li>
    <li> Until you start to eat any thing, then your dentures just start flapping around in your mouth, very diappointed I am.....</li>
    <li> Wish manufacturer would start to make it again, we need this product back on the market!</li>
    <li> I Love this product, I helps my lower dentures stay in place, I still have to use glue but not very much and it stays on the dentures for a week</li>
    <li> A family member of mine used to use this and it was the best product for their dentures. Suddenly, most stores like Walmart and Rite Aid stopped selling it. Even when my family member would smile, eat, and talk, it wouldn&#x27;t be whole heartedly done, because the grip of the dentures weren&#x27;t strong enough. We went 2 or 3 years trying to find it in our local town. Then, I found it on Amazon, and, as they say in the movies, the rest is history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My family member enjoys Cushion Grip a LOT! We will continue to support this brand. The seller made sure that the product was delivered in a timely fashion, and there was no damage to it. We will be ordering again, for sure.</li>
    <li> This is a good quick fix. Doesn&#x27;t last as long as the relining kits but still does a good job and fairly easy to use with no bad taste or smell.</li>
    <li> The Cushion Grip worked great the first time I used it. Still worked the second time, but it becomes more difficult with each attempt because the product becomes firmer each time it is opened to the air. You are better off using a reline kit or just regular denture adhesive.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s very easy to use and it really works when your dentures don&#x27;t fit exactly right.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly and holds well. It came in an unmarked box if privacy is needed. It worked for what I needed it for.</li>
    <li> Was really surprised at the tight fight of this product. Was fairly easy to apply when I obeyed the instructions. This product is not thin and gooey. Will never again use the slimy products. So glad I ordered this one.</li>
    <li> They had what i wanted at an excellent price.  for get it , for get it .for get it . forget nit .</li>
    <li> Great product. Holds teeth firmly in place while eating. Could not find in stores so glad to find it on here</li>
    <li> Works great, thank you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but not what I expected to me this is priced way to high for what it is I would not tell any one about it</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product.  I just got a top denture 4 months ago, and spent the first two months (as the extraction sites healed, swelling reduced, etc.) dealing with pinching, shifting, sore spots, swollen places...  It was a nightmare. I tried all the pastes, waxes, and other gummy goopy products to get comfort OR a good hold.  CushionGrip gives BOTH.  This product was pretty easy to apply, lasts for weeks with normal use and nightly soaks (I&#x27;ve only replaced it when I thought, \\&quot;Hey, it&#x27;s been there quite a while,\\&quot; - NOT because it was wearing out), and not only prevents sore spots from rubbing, but also creates a perfect \\&quot;vacuum\\&quot; seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, as others have mentioned, I do notice a tingling/burning sensation on the first application, but it goes away within minutes.  Also, for the first day or two after a new application, I have to trim off excess that has squeezed out the sides or back of the denture, and that is a little bothersome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall, the pros completely outweigh the cons. I will not only recommend this to any and all denture-wearing friends, but I will purchase it again, and again, and again.</li>
    <li> The taste is a little annoying at first, and it doesn&#x27;t really have any grip, but the cushion is the reason I keep buying Cushion Grip. Having a little between the hard plastic and my gums makes a world of difference in comfort. And it lasts for days, sometimes weeks. I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
    <li> Really pricey for what it is and does.  I expected much more.  It provides cushion but very little grip.  Not quite the value I expected for the price.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything to keep my bottom dentures in, i then seen the cushion grip thermoplastic denture adhesive and how it could hold denture for up to 4 days, What a load of rubbish ,you will be lucky if your dentures stay in for 4 hours ,never mind 4 days.&lt;br /&gt; Don&#x27;t waste your money this product is very poor .</li>
    <li> I was at the dentist every couple of months, needing him to tighten my wired in bridge.  After discovering this product I was able to stabilize the wire and wait until my normal visit.  It keeps my bridge in place and withstands eating and drinking.  For a quick fix that lasts I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few years and it works but I am not a fan of the color. I wish it would be a little more like the color of the dentures. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Purchased for a friend says he loves it</li>
    <li> For people with loose dentures that can&#x27;t afford the high price of relining, this is the best. Not like&lt;br /&gt;other products out there were you have to apply daily and remove it every night. This product allows&lt;br /&gt;you to fill gaps and it stays in place for days, just follow directions on package.&lt;br /&gt;So happy I found it again.</li>
    <li> this product is the only thing that works on dentures that need more &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; ... my dentures have never fit quite right and i have been using this product for A LOT OF YEARS.  I love it, however...it used to be (just 6 months ago) around $8.00 for a tube at the drug store, and sometimes less on Amazon. Now they don&#x27;t sell it any more because the price has more than doubled --overnight!  you can hardly get it for 18.00 a tube, most are over $20.  That is outrageous...the company must be a pharmaceutical company that does not care about the people who buy their product.&lt;br /&gt;I used to rate this product as a *****five star product.  The product is still excellent...the price makes it unaffordable for most people who need to use it,</li>
    <li> IT WAS TOO HARD TO WORK WITH TO APPLY TO DENTURES AND VERY PRICEY FOR THE PRODUCT. DID NOT LIKE THAT IT WAS NOT SHIPPED FROM US.. IT DID NOT WORK WELL EITHER. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND OR PURCHASE AGAIN.</li>
    <li> YOU CAN BUY A TUBE FOR $7.00  in CVS</li>
    <li> This ideal cost a lot for just one I use to pay 24 dollars for 4 pack now it cost 17 or more for one so not happy but deal because the stores don&#x27;t selk no more.</li>
    <li> Cost on Cushion Grip is out of this world and would like to find it at a better cheap price, rather than being &#x27;RIPPED OFF&#x27; on eBay!&lt;br /&gt;The Li Po Charger has a bigger adopter than the last one I purchased so it&#x27;s more difficult to get a power supply connection to fit it!</li>
    <li> I have this for five years why take it from us this is so wrong but I know you don&#x27;t ware faded teeth so you don&#x27;t have a problem thanks to you I want be able to eat nuts or any hard produce I cant afford to pay 62.00 nor 248.00 thanks fir nothing</li>
    <li> Was not any better than anything else I have tried.Was not like a adhesive, only lasted about 2 hours&lt;br /&gt; Fixodent seems to work the best,</li>
    <li> Excellent product I hope they put this product back in the market again</li>
    <li> Only adhesive that last several days with each application. Don&#x27;t know it is there. May need to trim to fit the area but good choice.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted, and came sooner than they said.</li>
    <li> dont know if i did something wrong but this stuff didnt stick at all and it was horrible trying to get it on the partial. i thought it was a pain even to try, it is junk.</li>
    <li> Great product! ! but very expensive</li>
    <li> too expensive but is a wonderful product works better than anything else i have tried but too pricey i don&#x27;t think i will be ordering it again</li>
    <li> Did not work .not very good product</li>
    <li> This has a great taste and it lightly sweet. Has no unpleasant odor and good staying power. I think  everyone that tries it would like or love it. So give this product a shot!</li>
    <li> I think this is a good product to use temporary. I am in the process of getting implants in my lower dentures.</li>
    <li> The best adhesive i have used. I still have to use powder adhesive with it, but last a lot longer than powder alone.</li>
    <li> my quest goes on...hoped third time using was going to be the charm...lasted half way through breakfast this time, shorter than previous attempts.  as long as you don&#x27;t plan on eating works great, or a baby food or liquid diet....&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I wanted. Thank you so much. I also appreciated my fellow Amazonians answering my questions.&lt;br /&gt;Christine Schulz</li>
    <li> Very expensive for what you get.</li>
    <li> pathetic! used as directed applied to lower denture waited the required time opened mouth denture fell into my soup bowl...waiter approached and said is that a large fly in your soup? No, I replied that&#x27;s my lower denture.....Another worthless product sold in America</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK but not any better than other adhesives on the market.</li>
    <li> Another pain to use at least for me - would not buy it again. I can not really tell anyone else to try this.</li>
    <li> I did not know it could help as much as it does!!!!! Really Really like it.</li>
    <li> ATTENTION ALL USERS OF CUSHION GRIP.  MERCK HAS STOPPED MANUFACTURING CUSHION GRIP, WHY, UNKNOWN, BUT NOT AN INTELLIGENT BUSINESS DECISION.  CALL MERCK AT 1-800-317-2165 AND ASK THEM TO START  MAKING CUSHION GRIP AGAIN, PUT IT BACK ON THE MARKET.  TELL THEM THEY ARE LOSING SOOOO MUCH BY TAKING IT OFF THE MARKET AND SO ARE THEIR LOYAL CUSTOMERS.  WE WANT OUR CUSHION GRIP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CALL MERCK AT 1-800-317-2165&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> hard to find, paid way too much for this but only thing that helps my dad when he gets a sore under his dentures.</li>
    <li> if you follow the direction to theT the stuff works well.  Remember the stuff goes a long way</li>
    <li> Best product for dentures with no after taste and holds secure.</li>
    <li> It works great.  I have used it for quit a while now.  The only thing that works.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Aunt but it didn&#x27;t solve her problem with her lower plate.  It is probably an effective product for most people.  Lower plates are apparently much more difficult to maintain.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years to help adjust the fit of my dentures. It&#x27;s name says it all. It does it&#x27;s job we&#x27;ll. Replace after four days or you might have a problem removing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike</li>
    <li> Will buy again.  Much better than I expected, and yes I would reccomend it&lt;br /&gt;to a friend.  Try it, I&#x27;m sure you will like it.</li>
    <li> The cushion grip is a great product. It&#x27;s the only thing that makes it even possible for me to keep my bottom denture in. I would recommend it to everybody</li>
    <li> it forms into a rubber type of seal. It&#x27;s great for filling space on ill fitting dentures but not for new one or ones that fit. there is no room for it to fit between the gums and teeth.</li>
    <li> works great, especially on older dentures that may have worn a bit and become loose.</li>
    <li> Great product. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> that song come down to me was bad it played the same song over and over again thought there would be different songs on it</li>
    <li> This is the worse stuff they make and to boot it is the most expensive too. I want my money back on this deal. I followed the instructions word by word and did just as it said to do.</li>
    <li> Works great till I get to the dentist and get a permenant liner in.  I will tell everynody this is a good product.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my 85 year old father. He was very happy to get it. He was unable to find in retail stores. Thanks.</li>
    <li> it will not keep your dentures in.  At all.  Stays on the denture quite well, but will not attach to gums.  At all.</li>
    <li> Have used it for years. at one time you could buy it at the drugstore . would like to know why that changed?</li>
    <li> I have suffered with my dentures the entire last year since I got them. If I tried to eat with them, the lower denture fell right out. I recently found one product that worked enough to see me thru one meal, but Cushion Grip is in a league of its own! So very glad I found it!</li>
    <li> Does not hold dentures at all. Had to buy polygrip to help keep them in. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I ordered it for a friend.  She is very pleased with it and now has the address for future needs and order purposed.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I used this product once. I wasn&#x27;t really happy with it, so I quit using it. It feels funny in my mouth, and it made my face numb for about a minute when I used it. I got used to the sensation and it went away, but I didn&#x27;t like it, so I no longer use it.</li>
    <li> Product did not hold dentures in place even when following the directions completely as required. You open your mouth to speak and they fell out. Very embarassing.</li>
    <li> This is truly the best product I have found for giving my dentures a tight and more secure feeling! You have to be patient and learn to work with it,eventually you will develop a feel for applying it.Although it is not an adhesive in the sense that it sticks to your gum,it does provide a tighter more cushioned fit.</li>
    <li> Need this for my teeth  think I&#x27;ll order more</li>
    <li> This stuff works great for other things too. It actually turns to  plastic. You can use it repairng hard plastic items.</li>
    <li> So far this worked great for me.  My dentures were so loose and using so much denture adhesive to keep them in. These are just my temporary dentures till I get my permanant ones in July. The cushion grip definitely made them tighter and I could even eat foods that I was having a hard time with just regular denture adhesive.  I would recommend this to anyone that has ill fitting dentures. I do keep in the denture for about a week before I replace it. Soaking them does not effect it and I do use just a little poligrip adhesive at the roof of my mouth for that added security they will stay put</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t what I thought it would be.  I just didn&#x27;t care for it at all.  It has alot of good ratings, try it for yourself because what doesn&#x27;t work for one may for another.</li>
    <li> This is a weird sort of &amp;#34;goo&amp;#34; that comes out malleable like fairly hard putty. It can be molded, but it&#x27;s a little too hard to mold to the gums well enough. I left it in for a few days and it was VERY hard to remove! It seems to have a slightly glue-like consistency. I can see it being perhaps useful in &amp;#34;fine-tuning&amp;#34; a temporary reline kit, but DON&#x27;T confuse it with actual denture adhesive. It doesn&#x27;t stick to the gums AT ALL.</li>
    <li> I thought this would actually work at holding my dentures, but I was very wrong.  First it is quite difficult to get out of the tube and then it burns a bit when you first place your dentures in your mouth after applying it.  I could deal with those short comings, but the bottom line is that they just did not hold at all.  When I say at all, I mean I could not even eat a banana with this.  Save your money and stick with Fixodent.</li>
    <li> this item should come with a lot of instructions as to how to use it.  i made a mess of it because i did not know how to use it the directions on the box are not enough</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic.  It immediately relieves sore spots caused by dentures.  It is odorless and tasteless.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Cushion Grip did not last, about 15 mins. if that, I needed something stong I thought C G would do it, thats money down the drain.  In fact I put on artfical nails and one came off and I had no more ashivie, guess what I used Cushion Grip, I think It is the same thing same color and texture, didn&#x27;t hold long  Sorry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Sharon Roof</li>
    <li> I love cushion grip but you have almost tripled your price. sad to say u lost a customer.</li>
    <li> was a great product, but it&#x27;s way too expensive now.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for a week and it is the worst grip that I have ever used. It is way over priced and I would not recommend this item to anyone. I have returned to my old faithful that holds dentures much better.</li>
    <li> Works great !!! Wish it was not discontinued .</li>
    <li> I really do like this denture product! It does exactly what it says it does: it *cushions* your gums! My lower teeth are  now under MY control! Chewing my food is comparable to before I had dentures. ....and with no further hoop-la I will just say, &amp;#34;Before I use the last of this I will DEFINETLY order more!!!</li>
    <li> Love the product..........  Not crazy about the price.....</li>
    <li> Sorry but it did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Best thng since sliced bread!  This product has help me&lt;br /&gt;greatly.  Does everything it says it will do!  Saved me&lt;br /&gt;having to get denture relined and saved $$.</li>
    <li> This was a good product. It isn&#x27;t a very big container for the money but it works fairly well. I thought the shipping was a little much, but aside from that okay.</li>
    <li> Soft thermoplastic denture adhesive is very comfortable and relatively easy to use.  The bond is very secure and tough.  It feels llke a reline with bubblegum.  There is the offputtng tingle and the taste of the solvent but it is short lived.  No goo, no gaps -- good stuff.</li>
    <li> Just the product for a beautiful smile, great fit, easy wearing, feels comfortable in the mouth and easy to manage!</li>
    <li> Very useful product, met my expectations completely...........When compared to another brand I have using until recently, this grip lasts twice as long.</li>
    <li> This is the most terrible product I have ever used!!!!  Just use plain old Fixodent!!! Do this for 10 minutes...then that for 10 minutes....Who has the time for that?  and who would want to have the product work for 4 days?  Ugh!!!!  Dentures need to be soaked and cleaned daily and gums need to rest overnight.  Truly a disgusting product!!!!!</li>
    <li> Product is fantastic!!!  It&#x27;s just sad about the price gouging of product. I use to be able to get 4 tubes for 20$.....now 4 tubes for 109$ !!!!! Very very sad &amp; disgusting for customers with sensitive gums &amp; ill fitting dentures being forced to pay the &amp;#34;price&amp;#34; to be able to eat, until they can get something else done!!!!!!</li>
    <li> False advertisement. It doesn&#x27;t work any better than any other adhesive.</li>
</ol>
