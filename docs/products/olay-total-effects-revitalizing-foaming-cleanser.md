      <li>The morning after, my skin feels really soft and smooth!</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for 3 years and it really makes a difference to the quality of my skin, love this product, really fights 7 signs of aging</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use them as my daily cleaning but mostly for quick pick-ups and travel.  </li>
      <li>I also like that they are dry to begin with and lather up with warm water.</li>
      <li>These cloths are great for traveling but really hard to find..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using them since they first came out, and will continue to do so</li>
      <li>Actually, I like them much more than the pre-moistened types.  </li>
      <li>Compared to the Oil of Olay cleansing cloths for oily skin, Total Effects lathers more and lasts longer.  </li>

      <li>I love these facial clothes.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE these cleansing cloths and have a hard time finding them in the store so I am glad I found them at Amazon.  </li>

      <li>It works better than Olay 4-in-1 wash cloths, removes makeup as it should without feeling dry.</li>

      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I really wish I had not bought 3 months worth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I think they remove makeup very well and exfoliate skin.  </li>
      <li>Nothing to write home about and at the end of the day very wasteful.</li>
      <li>AND I REALLY LIKE THEM.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling clean but not dry.  </li>
      <li>It is sudsy and gentle on my face.</li>
      <li>This product is extremely gentle.</li>
      <li>I think the other line exfoliates better, too.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t make me break out like so many other products do.  </li>
      <li>Hand towel apply dirt back on your face, these allow you to have a truly clean face each day.</li>
      <li>My dark spots have faded, and my skin tone is more even.</li>
      <li>I love Olay products, but this one was too harsh for my skin and way too soapy.</li>
      <li>and i get 3 facial washings from one cloth!...very economical...</li>
      <li>(Could easily be cut in half or fourths.)  </li>
      <li>I have always use Oil of Olay in some form or fashion but this is my first time trying the Total Effects cleansing cloths.  </li>
      <li>However, they must be the TOTAL EFFECTS DAILY CLEANSING cloths--no other Olay versions work as well at maintaining a fresh layer of smooth skin on your face.</li>
      <li>I love these little individual towelettes with soap.</li>
      <li>These have really improved the overall look and feel of my over-40 skin.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin soft and revitalized.</li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t as soft as I&#x27;d like.</li>
      <li>These cloths are the only cleansing product I need to use, followed by a decent moisturizer.</li>
      <li>They leave no detectable residue behind, just a soft, lightly moisturized effect, even in the hardest of water.</li>
      <li>I cut them in half but still too much product in the cloth.</li>

    <li> I love Olay products, but this one was too harsh for my skin and way too soapy. It left my skin tight and dry feeling. I cut them in half but still too much product in the cloth. Not what I thought as you have to use a lot water to get the lather going and then  it&#x27;s messy when you have to wash the product off with lots of water.</li>
    <li> I have been using oil of olay for years its good for my skin</li>
    <li> I love these cloths. They leave no detectable residue behind, just a soft, lightly moisturized effect, even in the hardest of water. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these cloths.  I&#x27;ve been using them since they first came out, and will continue to do so</li>
    <li> I carry these in my travel bag so I do not get makeup on rags when I travel. They are very handy</li>
    <li> Ample suds - leaves you feeling clean.  (Could easily be cut in half or fourths.)  Great for at home or while traveling on the road.</li>
    <li> Great buy. Does all it say it will. Shrink pores and look younger. Try it . Use it everyday and youll see a difference</li>
    <li> I love the way these wipes &amp;#34;suds up&amp;#34; when water is applied. They leave your face feeling  squeaky clean and soft.</li>
    <li> These things are made for the perfectionist. Hand towel apply dirt back on your face, these allow you to have a truly clean face each day. Lots of cleanser in them I&#x27;m going to start cutting them in half to create more of a supply. I ordered two boxes but a half of a sheet will do the job. My face looks and feels great. I have eczema and you can&#x27;t even see my rough patches.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this was a knock of for not. No copyright on package.</li>
    <li> Works great- nice lather. Nice to use when traveling</li>
    <li> I have been using the 4 in 1 Olay Washcloths for years and love them.  They have really gone up in price, so I saw these as an Amazon add-on at an amazing price and decided to give them a try.  I actually thought I was upgrading my skin care, since they were in the total effects line. I really wish I had not bought 3 months worth.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the 4-1 line.  They seem to have more product, as far as a creamy lather.  These are OK, I guess and do a good job at removing mascara, but don&#x27;t really produce much lather. I think the other line exfoliates better, too. I will be going back to the other line, as long as Amazon carries them. They are also getting hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> These cloths are really nice. Just add water and you get a lather to wash your face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is great and the product ingredients are pure. Who could ask for more. These cloths are a solid material where the regular Olay cloths are vented. They are both great products.</li>
    <li> I use these to take whenI travel.  They are convenient and work well</li>
    <li> I LOVE these cleansing cloths and have a hard time finding them in the store so I am glad I found them at Amazon.  They are the perfect thing for cleaning your face at the end of the day and there is a surprising amount of cleanser in each cloth.  They are textured so they are also an great gentle daily scrub.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the cloths for years and I love them. I just wish they start back selling them in the store.</li>
    <li> These are GREAT!!!  I use them in the shower for a &amp;#34;disposable washcloth&amp;#34;.  Not as harsh as other facial cloths I have used.  I also like that they are dry to begin with and lather up with warm water.</li>
    <li> I like these cloths and have been using them for a few years.  Actually, I like them much more than the pre-moistened types.  These are more like using a washcloth with suds - doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes when I remove eye make-up either.  It just feels cleaner and the cloth offers a little exfoliation too.</li>
    <li> These have really improved the overall look and feel of my over-40 skin. My dark spots have faded, and my skin tone is more even. I have combination skin (still, at my age!), and this has helped even it out. Great product.</li>
    <li> Love these cloths but a bit pricey.  I think they remove makeup very well and exfoliate skin.  Skin feels smooth and clean after using.  Will definitely buy again.  Doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin or irritate.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years with total satisfaction. However, I would prefer it to be a little less expensive.</li>
    <li> Use  Olay Total Effects cloths mornings and nights. It leaves my skin soft and revitalized. Will definitely recommend to a friend</li>
    <li> I love these convenient cleansing cloths for traveling or nightly use, leaves skin clean and taut. Convenient order from Amazon with great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always use and love Olay 4-in-1 wash cloths. They are convenience, quick and get the job well done. They left my face feel a little bit dry after washing, but nothing can&#x27;t fix by a facial serum and night cream. However, when I stumbled upon Olay Total Effects Lathering Cleansing Cloths, I know I have to make the switch. It works better than Olay 4-in-1 wash cloths, removes makeup as it should without feeling dry. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love that these pads remove all my make-up and leaves my skin clean.</li>
    <li> Olay...how can you go wrong...have a number of their products and never bought this one...very pleasant to use...and i get 3 facial washings from one cloth!...very economical...el fed</li>
    <li> I have always use Oil of Olay in some form or fashion but this is my first time trying the Total Effects cleansing cloths.  I&#x27;m in love with them.  It feels like you are giving yourself a mini facial every time you use them.  Compared to the Oil of Olay cleansing cloths for oily skin, Total Effects lathers more and lasts longer.  I feel as though my skin can breathe.  It&#x27;s gentle on my skin, meaning it doesn&#x27;t dry it out or cause it to create more oil.  Perfect.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for my skin that is finally transitioning from oily, acne-prone to normal. They lathered easily and it was easy to rinse. The morning after, my skin feels really soft and smooth!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get these locally anymore, and they&#x27;re my go-to for my evening cleansing ritual.</li>
    <li> Convenient and easy to use to cleanse your face .  Just add water . Could not be easier to use especially on a trip .</li>
    <li> Great item.  Love the way my face feels.</li>
    <li> These work well in a pinch but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t use them every day. They aren&#x27;t as soft as I&#x27;d like. I imagine it&#x27;s because of the cleanser on the cloths. They do smell really good and were good for my trip.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 years and it really makes a difference to the quality of my skin, love this product, really fights 7 signs of aging</li>
    <li> I cut these in half to stretch them and use them when traveling, or when I just need to remove makeup.  They are sudsy at first, but there is no sting. I then rinse them out, rinse my face and wipe again to remove all traces and dry my face.  I think they are convenient, work well to remove makeup, and travel well. Sometimes you can even reuse them once.</li>
    <li> These cloths are great for traveling but really hard to find.. I hate the wet cloths so I&#x27;m glad Amazon still has these.</li>
    <li> So luxurious! it lathers beautifully and deep cleans your skin. it moisturizes as it cleans, so my skin always looks more beautiful after using them. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> This is so far the best cleansing that I have used. I used get purchase them from Target, but Amazon is got better price now.</li>
    <li> Nothing to write home about and at the end of the day very wasteful.</li>
    <li> Great product... very much worth the price.</li>
    <li> I GOT WHAT I ORDERED. I HAVE USED THESE BEFORE AND I REALLY LIKE THEM. I WILL ORDER THEM AGAIN.</li>
    <li> My wife loves these things and finds them to be a superior product. No offense to Amazon, but she wishes she could buy them in the store.</li>
    <li> The Olay Total Effects cleansing cloths are just the ticket for a serious, but not too abrasive, exfoliating treatment.
