      <li>Fantastic!</li>

      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>You are going to pay more than what you paid for the item.  </li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>This nail strengthener cream worked like magic on my nails.  </li>
      <li>I was experimenting again, and I should know better.  </li>
      <li>that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
      <li>wish it worked better...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years.</li>
      <li>But as soon as you put cream on nails, it nourishes them &amp; they look so much better.  </li>
      <li>I used this product once, years ago, but lost the jar before I could extract any meaningful results.  </li>
      <li>My nails have a lot more strength and seem to grow longer as well.</li>
      <li>which is just another added bonus :)</li>
      <li>my cuticals look much better.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for many many years.  </li>
      <li>I think based on the thickness of this product, it&#x27;s meant more for people with brittle nails that chip or crack.</li>
      <li>Should have paid more attention to the lower ratings.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never tried a nail strengthening cream before, but I&#x27;m glad I tried this one.</li>
      <li>and this makes them grow strong and healthy.</li>
      <li>Tablets + Hair Growth Essentials - 60 capsules - Promotes Hair Growth, Healthy Skin, and Strong Nails]]) to help as well.</li>
      <li>So I bought this product for its good reviews and I can&#x27;t tell enough good about it.</li>
      <li>I would give it a good 8 weeks to really see a difference.</li>
      <li>Good product .. fast shipping ..</li>
      <li>It was fresh &amp; nice and creamy.  </li>
      <li>I have lovely fingernails for the first time in years and years!!  </li>
      <li>Oh and it arrived very quickly.  </li>
      <li>Easy to just rub on in the evening while watching TV or reading</li>
      <li>and it made my nails strong.</li>
      <li>My nails are strong and</li>
      <li>It makes nails strong and flexible.  </li>
      <li>I cannot believe how strong my nails are.</li>
      <li>It absorbs easily and quickly and makes all the difference!</li>
      <li>the others were fine.  </li>
      <li>Was amazed how quickly my nails responded!</li>
      <li>All of this together has made a huge difference.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen a huge improvement and</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
      <li>THIS STUFF IS FANTASTIC.</li>
      <li>I rarely post reviews, but was so pleased</li>
      <li>if the claims for stronger nails are justified.  </li>
      <li>I am now using it again with the same great results.</li>
      <li>Fabulous cuticle cream</li>
      <li>I am thrilled with the improvement and my hands are looking much improved.  </li>
      <li>B00BYNGI5I Free</li>
      <li>Well worth the cost!</li>
      <li>the aplicatiion is time consuming but sooooo worth it!  </li>
      <li>She was so excited when I gave some to her for Christmas!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It has a unique smell because it contains lanolin.</li>
      <li>I am so excited.</li>
      <li>Barielle&#x27;s reputation stems from this outstanding nail strengthening cream that originally was created to condition the hooves of thoroughbred racehorses; the side affect being that the groomers also developed beautifully strong, peel and split free nails.</li>
      <li>, my nails were thinner than paper-thin, full of ridges and peeling.  </li>
      <li>After a full jar of Barielle Nail Strengthener</li>
      <li>My nails do seem to be a bit stronger, but don&#x27;t grow any faster, or really look any better.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.    </li>
      <li>IF I REMEMBER TO USE IT, THIS IS A TRIED AND TRUE WAY</li>
      <li>Nice and long and healthy.</li>
      <li>I love this product and had to search for it at high end retail stores.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve written off Barielle as the most high priced gimmick products I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
      <li>Very fast shipping!  </li>
      <li>Will definitely reorder as I&#x27;m very pleased.  </li>
      <li>My nails used to split and chip easily, but this product really strengthened my nails.  </li>
      <li>This cream is easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t take much for each application.</li>
      <li>saw the crazy great reviews for this and thought it was too good to be true.</li>
      <li>This is a great product but must be used for several months to allow your new nails to grow out.  </li>
      <li>Reasonable price, accurate description, quick delivery.</li>
      <li>This cream is very good at keeping my cuticles soft and smooth, and my nails do appear to be less prone to peeling off in layers.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t give it five stars for that reason but, at the very least, it seems to be an excellent cuticle cream.  </li>
      <li>An ounce doesn&#x27;t sound like much</li>
      <li>The old stuff is soooo much better.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth buying.  </li>
      <li>It might cost me a bit more, but I&#x27;ll get the actual product, not some cheap cream</li>
      <li>The professional version works better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only way I can have nails that grow out &amp; look nice with a manicure.</li>
      <li>He used it immediately and it has quieted him down remarkably.  </li>
      <li>I knew I was on the right track.  </li>
      <li>My nails are very soft and they bend and tear easily.</li>
      <li>Nice to use, but results not clear.</li>
      <li>The cost is very reasonable.</li>
      <li>I started using Barielle Nail Strengthener Cream 25 or 30 years ago when it first was marketed.</li>
      <li>After the first 1 oz.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve recommended it to several friends who are also pleased.</li>
      <li>IT WORKS EXACTLY</li>
      <li>Remember you need a really nutirtious diet too !</li>
      <li>Seemed old others in the order were more like normal.</li>
      <li>It works really well!</li>
      <li>This cream really works!  </li>
      <li>I tried it and it worked pretty well,</li>
      <li>My most recent purchase was in May 2011 and boy has this changed!</li>
      <li>I could by a drugstore cream for 1/3 of the price and get the same or better results.</li>
      <li>The first time I put it on, my nails soaked it up in minutes.  </li>
      <li>When I use it regularly, my nails are not brittle and able to grow.</li>
      <li>I put the cream on my hands as many times a day as I can remember especially before I put my rubber gloves on to wash dishes</li>
      <li>I started taking Biotin to help hair and nails and recently remember this favorite</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t use a product that you can only buy via mail-order for 25 years if you don&#x27;t love it.</li>
      <li>I have to keep using it, but it is exactly what I need.</li>
      <li>but all in all fake nails really do more harm than good.</li>
      <li>I think it has made a positive difference in the condition of my nails.</li>
      <li>Tried and true old school product for suffering nails.</li>
      <li>It used to be incredibly moisturizing and a small jar would last forever.</li>
      <li>I love this product and put it on my nails almost every single night.  </li>
      <li>, My nails were a mess &amp; embarrassing, now they look nice.</li>
      <li>think, that the company that is distributing it will be more aware of the quality of this product its shelf life and not sell it if it&#x27;s over the due date.</li>
      <li>Several months ago I started using it and within a week or two saw a huge difference.</li>
      <li>and I wore acrylic nails for over 20 years straight.</li>
      <li>I use it every night when I get ready for bed</li>
      <li>but you don&#x27;t use much.  </li>
      <li>This product also really hellped my unruly cuticles.</li>
      <li>Absolutely, a miracle nail cream from Barielle.</li>
      <li>This product really helps my nails grow.  </li>
      <li>Really.    </li>
      <li>Very helpful.</li>
      <li>I am returning this product and hope to find the real deal some</li>
      <li>They are much stronger and healthier.  </li>
      <li>Very Good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barbara</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a month now and it really hasn&#x27;t changed the way my nails break off, so</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is not the real deal.  </li>
      <li>and it really feels like it is strengthening my finger nails.</li>
      <li>and I think it has really helped.</li>
      <li>After a month I dint see much if a difference it might just not be notisable</li>
      <li>I purchased this to treat my flaking nails and this worked very well.</li>
      <li>so it can really sink in.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>and it really seems to work.</li>
      <li>I hope other people are getting better results.</li>
      <li>I finally went to a manicurist and she scrapped the polish off after soaking my nails in special polish remover.  </li>
      <li>I never thought it was possible to have natural nails that actually looked nice.</li>
      <li>and I know my new jar will finish the job!</li>
      <li>you are lucky enough to have a max growth rate on your nails, then you don&#x27;t need this stuff.</li>
      <li>Never had decent nails- went to acrylics for 16 years -</li>
      <li>It is the only thing that ever helps my nails when they continually break off below the quick and peel etc.</li>
      <li>I continue to use it and  highly recommend it,</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for 3 years and highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>To me it&#x27;s just a high priced moisturizer.</li>
      <li>So I bought two little tubs of Carmichaels (or Carmichel&#x27;s) and my nails are better again.  </li>
      <li>The cream in one was very yellowed which indicates the product was too old.</li>
      <li>Miss Pink Cat buys at the dollar store and slops into a cheap jar.</li>
      <li>It takes several weeks to see a real effect, but I was willing to commit to the treatment this time around.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used this product quite long enough to know for sure</li>
      <li>There is NOTHING like this on the market - my nails are so thin, this keeps them in good condition and just takes a moment to apply.  </li>
      <li>You have to use it regularly to get decent consistent results.</li>
      <li>The new jar has no smell whatsoever.</li>
      <li>From the first time I used this, my fingers had a blue stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They are still soft, peeling and breaking!  </li>
      <li>I have an old jar and a new jar -</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it says it does, and I have the nice long hard fingernails to prove it!</li>
      <li>My nails are soft and have ridges.  </li>
      <li>Barielle Natural Nail Camouflage, .5 fl oz (14.8 ml)]]</li>
      <li>This product and the Barielle Intensive Nail Renewal Oil are intended to be gently massaged into the nail for several minutes.</li>
      <li>This purchase of Barielle was old, rancid and does not work.  </li>
      <li>I had only been using the product for a couple of weeks, but I have seen very noticeable improvement in my nails.  </li>
      <li>An old friend I haven&#x27;t used in forever.  </li>
      <li>As of 2014 the product I got is the &amp;#34;old recipe&amp;#34;, which is thick with a prominent smell of lanoline.  </li>
      <li>I have to use 3x the amount of the new cream to get barely any effect.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product in addition to the protein nail builder from the same brand.</li>
      <li>I had such high hopes after reading some of the reviews.  </li>
      <li>they are almost back to normal..</li>
      <li>Well, last night I received my new jar...</li>
      <li>Works very well on dry cuticles and nails.  </li>
      <li>So far, it has been well worth the money and trouble.  </li>
      <li>Every time I stop my weak nails get more splitting, tearing &amp; my cuticles get ragged.</li>
      <li>If you look at the Barielle website, the real product has a small horse on the label on the left, not a gold horse on the right.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gelled them just to keep them long enough to do normal tasks - scratch</li>
      <li>It is white and very creamy as I had originally expected.  </li>
      <li>At first you should smear a little on your nails and cuticles nightly.  </li>
      <li>Works well on my nails so far, but we will see in the long run.</li>
      <li>The portion of the nail that is still thin from drilling is like a strong nail.</li>
      <li>so they wear down more slowly and the growth rate now exceeds the rate of wear.  </li>
      <li>I have used it at least once a day for a couple months, and they look new &amp; much stronger.  </li>

<li> I am glad Amazon carries it.</li>
<li> I love this stuff.</li>
<li> The nail tips get whiter and look much better.</li>
<li> Love this product.</li>
<li> You are going to pay more than what you paid for the item.  </li>
<li> Love it.  </li>
<li> This nail strengthener cream worked like magic on my nails.  </li>
<li> I was experimenting again, and I should know better.  </li>
<li> that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
<li> wish it worked better...</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years.</li>
<li> But as soon as you put cream on nails, it nourishes them &amp; they look so much better.  </li>
<li> I used this product once, years ago, but lost the jar before I could extract any meaningful results.  </li>
<li> My nails have a lot more strength and seem to grow longer as well.</li>
<li> which is just another added bonus :)</li>
<li> my cuticals look much better.</li>
<li> I have used this product for many many years.  </li>
<li> I think based on the thickness of this product, it&#x27;s meant more for people with brittle nails that chip or crack.</li>
<li> Should have paid more attention to the lower ratings.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never tried a nail strengthening cream before, but I&#x27;m glad I tried this one.</li>
<li> and this makes them grow strong and healthy.</li>
<li> Tablets + Hair Growth Essentials - 60 capsules - Promotes Hair Growth, Healthy Skin, and Strong Nails]]) to help as well.</li>
<li> So I bought this product for its good reviews and I can&#x27;t tell enough good about it.</li>
<li> I would give it a good 8 weeks to really see a difference.</li>
<li> Good product .. fast shipping ..</li>
<li> It was fresh &amp; nice and creamy.  </li>
<li> I have lovely fingernails for the first time in years and years!!  </li>
<li> Oh and it arrived very quickly.  </li>
<li> Easy to just rub on in the evening while watching TV or reading</li>
<li> and it made my nails strong.</li>
<li> My nails are strong and</li>
<li> It makes nails strong and flexible.  </li>
<li> I cannot believe how strong my nails are.</li>
<li> It absorbs easily and quickly and makes all the difference!</li>
<li> the others were fine.  </li>
<li> Was amazed how quickly my nails responded!</li>
<li> All of this together has made a huge difference.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve seen a huge improvement and</li>
<li> This is a fantastic product.</li>
<li> THIS STUFF IS FANTASTIC.</li>
<li> I rarely post reviews, but was so pleased</li>
<li> if the claims for stronger nails are justified.  </li>
<li> I am now using it again with the same great results.</li>
<li> Fabulous cuticle cream</li>
<li> I am thrilled with the improvement and my hands are looking much improved.  </li>
<li> B00BYNGI5I Free</li>
<li> Well worth the cost!</li>
<li> the aplicatiion is time consuming but sooooo worth it!  </li>
<li> She was so excited when I gave some to her for Christmas!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> It has a unique smell because it contains lanolin.</li>
<li> I am so excited.</li>
<li> Barielle&#x27;s reputation stems from this outstanding nail strengthening cream that originally was created to condition the hooves of thoroughbred racehorses; the side affect being that the groomers also developed beautifully strong, peel and split free nails.</li>
<li> , my nails were thinner than paper-thin, full of ridges and peeling.  </li>
<li> After a full jar of Barielle Nail Strengthener</li>
<li> My nails do seem to be a bit stronger, but don&#x27;t grow any faster, or really look any better.  </li>
<li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.    </li>
<li> IF I REMEMBER TO USE IT, THIS IS A TRIED AND TRUE WAY</li>
<li> Nice and long and healthy.</li>
<li> I love this product and had to search for it at high end retail stores.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve written off Barielle as the most high priced gimmick products I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
<li> Very fast shipping!  </li>
<li> Will definitely reorder as I&#x27;m very pleased.  </li>
<li> My nails used to split and chip easily, but this product really strengthened my nails.  </li>
<li> This cream is easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t take much for each application.</li>
<li> saw the crazy great reviews for this and thought it was too good to be true.</li>
<li> This is a great product but must be used for several months to allow your new nails to grow out.  </li>
<li> Reasonable price, accurate description, quick delivery.</li>
<li> This cream is very good at keeping my cuticles soft and smooth, and my nails do appear to be less prone to peeling off in layers.</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t give it five stars for that reason but, at the very least, it seems to be an excellent cuticle cream.  </li>
<li> An ounce doesn&#x27;t sound like much</li>
<li> The old stuff is soooo much better.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth buying.  </li>
<li> It might cost me a bit more, but I&#x27;ll get the actual product, not some cheap cream</li>
<li> The professional version works better.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s the only way I can have nails that grow out &amp; look nice with a manicure.</li>
<li> He used it immediately and it has quieted him down remarkably.  </li>
<li> I knew I was on the right track.  </li>
<li> My nails are very soft and they bend and tear easily.</li>
<li> Nice to use, but results not clear.</li>
<li> The cost is very reasonable.</li>
<li> I started using Barielle Nail Strengthener Cream 25 or 30 years ago when it first was marketed.</li>
<li> After the first 1 oz.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve recommended it to several friends who are also pleased.</li>
<li> IT WORKS EXACTLY</li>
<li> Remember you need a really nutirtious diet too !</li>
<li> Seemed old others in the order were more like normal.</li>
<li> It works really well!</li>
<li> This cream really works!  </li>
<li> I tried it and it worked pretty well,</li>
<li> My most recent purchase was in May 2011 and boy has this changed!</li>
<li> I could by a drugstore cream for 1/3 of the price and get the same or better results.</li>
<li> The first time I put it on, my nails soaked it up in minutes.  </li>
<li> When I use it regularly, my nails are not brittle and able to grow.</li>
<li> I put the cream on my hands as many times a day as I can remember especially before I put my rubber gloves on to wash dishes</li>
<li> I started taking Biotin to help hair and nails and recently remember this favorite</li>
<li> You don&#x27;t use a product that you can only buy via mail-order for 25 years if you don&#x27;t love it.</li>
<li> I have to keep using it, but it is exactly what I need.</li>
<li> but all in all fake nails really do more harm than good.</li>
<li> I think it has made a positive difference in the condition of my nails.</li>
<li> Tried and true old school product for suffering nails.</li>
<li> It used to be incredibly moisturizing and a small jar would last forever.</li>
<li> I love this product and put it on my nails almost every single night.  </li>
<li> , My nails were a mess &amp; embarrassing, now they look nice.</li>
<li> think, that the company that is distributing it will be more aware of the quality of this product its shelf life and not sell it if it&#x27;s over the due date.</li>
<li> Several months ago I started using it and within a week or two saw a huge difference.</li>
<li> and I wore acrylic nails for over 20 years straight.</li>
<li> I use it every night when I get ready for bed</li>
<li> but you don&#x27;t use much.  </li>
<li> This product also really hellped my unruly cuticles.</li>
<li> Absolutely, a miracle nail cream from Barielle.</li>
<li> This product really helps my nails grow.  </li>
<li> Really.    </li>
<li> Very helpful.</li>
<li> I am returning this product and hope to find the real deal some</li>
<li> They are much stronger and healthier.  </li>
<li> Very Good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barbara</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used it for a month now and it really hasn&#x27;t changed the way my nails break off, so</li>
<li> /&gt;This is not the real deal.  </li>
<li> and it really feels like it is strengthening my finger nails.</li>
<li> and I think it has really helped.</li>
<li> After a month I dint see much if a difference it might just not be notisable</li>
<li> I purchased this to treat my flaking nails and this worked very well.</li>
<li> so it can really sink in.  </li>
<li> I highly recommend it!</li>
<li> and it really seems to work.</li>
<li> I hope other people are getting better results.</li>
<li> I finally went to a manicurist and she scrapped the polish off after soaking my nails in special polish remover.  </li>
<li> I never thought it was possible to have natural nails that actually looked nice.</li>
<li> and I know my new jar will finish the job!</li>
<li> you are lucky enough to have a max growth rate on your nails, then you don&#x27;t need this stuff.</li>
<li> Never had decent nails- went to acrylics for 16 years -</li>
<li> It is the only thing that ever helps my nails when they continually break off below the quick and peel etc.</li>
<li> I continue to use it and  highly recommend it,</li>
<li> I highly recommend it.</li>
<li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
<li> I have used this product for 3 years and highly recommend.</li>
<li> I highly recommend.</li>
<li> To me it&#x27;s just a high priced moisturizer.</li>
<li> So I bought two little tubs of Carmichaels (or Carmichel&#x27;s) and my nails are better again.  </li>
<li> The cream in one was very yellowed which indicates the product was too old.</li>
<li> Miss Pink Cat buys at the dollar store and slops into a cheap jar.</li>
<li> It takes several weeks to see a real effect, but I was willing to commit to the treatment this time around.  </li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t used this product quite long enough to know for sure</li>
<li> There is NOTHING like this on the market - my nails are so thin, this keeps them in good condition and just takes a moment to apply.  </li>
<li> You have to use it regularly to get decent consistent results.</li>
<li> The new jar has no smell whatsoever.</li>
<li> From the first time I used this, my fingers had a blue stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> They are still soft, peeling and breaking!  </li>
<li> I have an old jar and a new jar -</li>
<li> It does exactly what it says it does, and I have the nice long hard fingernails to prove it!</li>
<li> My nails are soft and have ridges.  </li>
<li> Barielle Natural Nail Camouflage, .5 fl oz (14.8 ml)]]</li>
<li> This product and the Barielle Intensive Nail Renewal Oil are intended to be gently massaged into the nail for several minutes.</li>
<li> This purchase of Barielle was old, rancid and does not work.  </li>
<li> I had only been using the product for a couple of weeks, but I have seen very noticeable improvement in my nails.  </li>
<li> An old friend I haven&#x27;t used in forever.  </li>
<li> As of 2014 the product I got is the &amp;#34;old recipe&amp;#34;, which is thick with a prominent smell of lanoline.  </li>
<li> I have to use 3x the amount of the new cream to get barely any effect.</li>
<li> I highly recommend this product in addition to the protein nail builder from the same brand.</li>
<li> I had such high hopes after reading some of the reviews.  </li>
<li> they are almost back to normal..</li>
<li> Well, last night I received my new jar...</li>
<li> Works very well on dry cuticles and nails.  </li>
<li> So far, it has been well worth the money and trouble.  </li>
<li> Every time I stop my weak nails get more splitting, tearing &amp; my cuticles get ragged.</li>
<li> If you look at the Barielle website, the real product has a small horse on the label on the left, not a gold horse on the right.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve gelled them just to keep them long enough to do normal tasks - scratch</li>
<li> It is white and very creamy as I had originally expected.  </li>
<li> At first you should smear a little on your nails and cuticles nightly.  </li>
<li> Works well on my nails so far, but we will see in the long run.</li>
<li> The portion of the nail that is still thin from drilling is like a strong nail.</li>
<li> so they wear down more slowly and the growth rate now exceeds the rate of wear.  </li>
<li> I have used it at least once a day for a couple months, and they look new &amp; much stronger.  </li>
<li> It will soak right into dry cuticles and nails within a few minutes, even if your hands are dry.   </li>
<li> purchased this product base of the many positive reviews.</li>
<li> doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
<li> I have not used this product long enough to know if it works.</li>
<li> Definitely recommend &amp; will use as long as they make it!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this nail cream for over 20 years, and it&#x27;s the only thing that helps the dry skin around my nails.</li>
<li> No matter how dry your cuticles are, this stuff will soften them and daily use will keep them supple.   </li>
<li> I couldn&#x27;t get my dry, ridged nails to grow at all until I started using Barielle Nail Strengthener daily.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used it almost every night for the past several months and all but my index finger are growing normally.  </li>
<li> So I think you can buy this product with confidence that you will get real stuff compared to the watery stuff some people complained about.&lt;br</li>
<li> I tried this product after using artificial nails continuously for more than 15 years.  </li>
<li> I found myself cutting my nails more often that I wanted to.</li>
<li> Thankfully, that craze is long over; and my nails have benefited ever since by using Barielle.</li>
<li> Remains for a long time.</li>
<li> had it a long time ago</li>
<li> - I&#x27;ve used it for a long time.  </li>
<li> I have struggled for a long time with brittle nails.</li>
<li> The product lasts a long time.</li>
<li> (Which still wasn&#x27;t too long)</li>
<li> As with the other nail hardening product that I purchased, it simply DOES NOT WORK!  </li>
<li> The container lasts a long time!</li>
<li> They never grow very long.</li>
<li> I do a lot of gardening and cleaning, don&#x27;t always remember to wear gloves, so I&#x27;m prone to dry cuticles and hangnails.  </li>
<li> My nails does not look as dry, but still have not gotten stronger as I would have hoped for.</li>
<li> I recommend it to my friends who have dry cuticles.</li>
<li> I love Barielle Nail creams, but this one arrived totally rancid with color dark yellow and smelling badly.</li>
<li> i used it every single day for about a month and it didn&#x27;t work on my nails</li>
<li> Last time I bought it on a different site, it was very solidified &amp; difficult to use.  </li>
<li> Not a bad cuticle moisturizer, but useless for strengthening nails.  </li>
<li> I practice 2-3 hours daily so, for me, my nails wear down faster than they grow.  </li>
<li> It was not even the same consistency as previous purchases.  </li>
<li> Makes nail Stronger and less likely to peel.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve only had a few minor chips in the two months I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
<li> One of the products was very dry</li>
<li> This product really helps strengthen my weak nails.</li>
<li> I have been using Barielle Nail Strengthener for years and it is one of the few products that actually does what it promises to do.  </li>
<li> I have used this nail cream for years; getting harder to find it in stores</li>
<li> Oily, thin and really stinky.</li>
<li> For the last few years I have struggled with peeling and brittle nails.</li>
<li> It gets harder to find....</li>
<li> Did not work as well as I expected.  </li>
<li> This is not what I expected from the Barielle product.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve now been using the product religiously for about 2 months and not only do my nails feel thick but some are growing to the point of needing to be filed.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way, so the price really is not unreasonable at all.  </li>
<li> I also  take biotin and apply Pink Armour every other day.</li>
<li> I found the other reviews helpful, so I purchased this cream.  </li>
<li> I also like the fact that you don&#x27;t have to remove it at the end of the week like other products I have purchased.</li>
<li> I work in the medical field and through repetitive hand washing</li>
<li> Followed the directions VERY carefully.  </li>
<li> After wearing artificial nails for years, my own nails were thin, peeling...and had ridges that split vertically.  </li>
<li> is you use it every day, but I find it too inconvenient to use daily because your hands become very sticky after application.</li>
<li> In the past I&#x27;ve used strengtheners that are applied as polish (Sally Hanson products used to work for me), but they have lost their effectiveness over time, and my nails actually were in worse shape after using them, splitting frequently.  </li>
<li> My nails are weak and have tried it for a while, but so far have not seen noticeable improvement.  </li>
<li> have also found this to be helpful for my tough cuticles, as it makes them soft instead of having hangnails.</li>
<li> I am now forced to have naked nails and this cream has been a life saver.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s always been white and thick cream.</li>
<li> It looked like someone had just sanded them with sand paper and not very smoothly.  </li>
<li> I have less snags, tears and rips.  </li>
<li> My complaint is that the cream seems thin and doesn&#x27;t seem to coat my nails as much as I&#x27;d like.  </li>
<li> It seems to make the rest of the nail stronger so that when there is a chip it doesn&#x27;t take off half of your nail.</li>
<li> Every time I sit down I put a little on each nail and rub it into my cuticles as well, and they are not peeling or splitting like they were before I started using Barielle.  </li>
<li> I used to try to use gels or acrylics to let them grow out and stop the temptation to mess with or bite them</li>
<li> I just rub a little cream on my nails each night</li>
<li> My nails were pretty bad to due abuse by wearing acrylics.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Found this product through a salon and began using: after I came to my senses and removed the artificial ones.&lt;br /&gt;Second container - certainly seems to strengthen the nails.</li>
<li> I had purchased this before from a different supplier and it was beige and very thick like old-fashioned furniture wax.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> Have nails now that I haven&#x27;t had in years after wearing gelish nail polish for a few years.</li>
<li> a few x&#x27;s per day</li>
<li> I put this on a few times a day for a couple of weeks and the split was gone.</li>
<li> I got lazy, stopped using it, and things went down hill.</li>
<li> It was very thick and a little dab would go a long way.</li>
<li> Ultimately, I made matters worse by opting to wear acrylic nails on and off in the past to cover up these issues.</li>
<li> Over the past year, I had gel french nails done bi-weekly in a salon, unfortunately, after about 1 year, my nails were burning, which I know is due to filing/sanding.</li>
<li> My nails are always so short and painful when they break that for the last few years</li>
<li> I thought I was going to have to go the whole 3 months with ugly nails, but instead could use the ones that were damaged.</li>
<li> No more peeling or ridges either.</li>
<li> It has also improved the condition of my cuticles - no more hangnails.  </li>
<li> Not sure how they even got all these stars.</li>
<li> Stronger nails, no more splitting.</li>
<li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE!</li>
<li> Sorry, for only two stars it work for others, but it did not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> yeah not sure about it</li>
<li> At some point I stopped, not sure why.  </li>
<li> I wore fake because I thought my natural nails were too weak, and they did literally bend like paper.</li>
<li> I have been using it at least twice a day if not more...</li>
<li> Hard to find in retail stores.</li>
<li> hard to tell what it is doing.  </li>
<li> Have tried a lot of products for the nails  and been disappointed so have high hopes for this one.</li>
<li> I wore acrylic nails for at least 5 yrs.</li>
<li> Just rub it in at least once a day--you&#x27;ll be amazed at difference in 1 or two weeks.</li>
<li> Amazon&#x27;s pricing was the least in cost.  </li>
<li> He has seen dramatic results after a few days of using it twice a day and he plans to continue using it.</li>
<li> No one told me it was impossible to take off with regular polish remover.  </li>
<li> Not good.</li>
<li> I have weak, splitting nails</li>
<li> I recommend it for anyone with weak, splitting nails.  </li>
<li> they are still weak.</li>
<li> And grow very slowly.</li>
<li> I have horrible weak nails, but after just a couple of weeks they are so much stronger.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried everything on my thin nails.  </li>
<li> My nails were paper thin.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m sick that I spent the money.  </li>
<li> My nails started to grow but noticed that they were not hard and to make it worst every week a nail will break from the root.</li>
<li> I just started nursing school and the Dean said, &amp;#34;No Fake Nails.&amp;#34;  </li>
<li> I bought this product and then failed to use it for quite some time.</li>
<li> Nothing wrong with it, just hasn&#x27;t done anything for my nails.</li>
<li> I would recommend it for anyone with nails that are difficult to grow.</li>
<li> The cream is very very thin and does not moisturize well at all.</li>
<li> Does not smell bad.</li>
<li> I spoke to someone at Barielle and they said it was probably from the bad batch that they recalled.</li>
<li> It also helps to soften the skin around the nails and prevents painful cracks.</li>
<li> I am so disappointed that they changed the formula.</li>
<li> For what it is NOW, the price is simply OUTRAGEOUS!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using these on my somewhat brittle nails which also have some ridges in them, and it has definitely been strengthening them! They are stronger and nicer looking than they have been for quite some time.</li>
    <li> I started using Barielle Nail Strengthener Cream 25 or 30 years ago when it first was marketed. What attracted me to it was the advertisement that it was derived from the cream used to strengthen and repair racing horses&#x27; hooves - and it worked great!  Then acrylic nails came out and I wore acrylic nails for over 20 years straight. When I retired I decided not to have any more acrylics and needless to say, my nails were thinner than paper-thin, full of ridges and peeling.  I remembered how good Barielle Nail Strengthener Cream was and started using it again.  I use it every night when I get ready for bed so I know I won&#x27;t be washing my hands for several hours and the cream has time to penetrate in my nails.  After the first 1 oz. container, my nails are strong and beautiful. No more peeling or ridges either. I continue to use it and  highly recommend it,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this nail cream for over 20 years, and it&#x27;s the only thing that helps the dry skin around my nails. Well worth the cost!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best product for damaged nails.  After wearing artificial nails for years, my own nails were thin, peeling...and had ridges that split vertically.  Pros said they would always be this way....NOT SO!  After a full jar of Barielle Nail Strengthener they are almost back to normal..and I know my new jar will finish the job!</li>
    <li> This can strengthen your nails and help heal cuticles. You have to use it regularly to get decent consistent results.</li>
    <li> This product exceeds our expectations.  My husband and I have both been using it.  My nails are soft and have ridges.  I have been using the cream twice a day on my nails and cuticles.  My nails started looking and feeling stronger after only 3 days.  It has also improved the condition of my cuticles - no more hangnails.  My husband has had thinning nails for several years.  They split, break and have ridges.  He has seen 2 dermatologists and they were no help.  I convinced him to try the Barielle cream when I got it.  He has seen dramatic results after a few days of using it twice a day and he plans to continue using it.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product. My nails were brittle and spongy and my doctor advised stopping all use of polish. That didn&#x27;t work. I tried this because it was on sale and what did I have to lose? Well, it took two weeks, but my nails are now healthy and growing. I still use it twice a day. I&#x27;ve recommended it to several friends who are also pleased. FIVE STARS!!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Hard to find in retail stores.</li>
    <li> My nails have peeled, cracked and split since I was a child. Nothing I do fixes them - eating more protein, strengtheners, etc etc. My nails are always so short and painful when they break that for the last few years I&#x27;ve gelled them just to keep them long enough to do normal tasks - scratch my dog, peel of a sticker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw the crazy great reviews for this and thought it was too good to be true. I&#x27;ve now been using the product religiously for about 2 months and not only do my nails feel thick but some are growing to the point of needing to be filed. It&#x27;s a freaking miracle that&#x27;s 32 years in the making! I still don&#x27;t know WHY this stuff works, but it does.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband who seldom complains about any thing but was driving me nuts about his fingernails.  He used it immediately and it has quieted him down remarkably.  He said he could tell a difference in just a couple of days.  An ounce doesn&#x27;t sound like much but you don&#x27;t use much.  It is a white cream that moisturizers the nails and nail bed with all sorts of things that also make the nail stronger.  Peace (and quiet) has once again been restored.</li>
    <li> I have been using Barielle Nail Strengthener for years and it is one of the few products that actually does what it promises to do.  A little goes a long way, so the price really is not unreasonable at all.  I would definately recommend this to anyone with problem nails.</li>
    <li> I have used this product (along with the growth activator) for about a month now, and I have to say I am VERY happy with the results. I wore acrylic nails for at least 5 yrs. and then gels for about the same amount of time. I wore fake because I thought my natural nails were too weak, and they did literally bend like paper. Not good. Until these products!!! It&#x27;s like I have someone else&#x27;s hands!Yes the aplicatiion is time consuming but sooooo worth it!  This product also really hellped my unruly cuticles.You will not be disapointed.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, not too sticky and just goes in well at night to wake up with better and stronger nails.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this over similar products I have used.</li>
    <li> Absolutely, a miracle nail cream from Barielle. Barielle&#x27;s reputation stems from this outstanding nail strengthening cream that originally was created to condition the hooves of thoroughbred racehorses; the side affect being that the groomers also developed beautifully strong, peel and split free nails. My nails have always been prone to peeling and breakage. Ultimately, I made matters worse by opting to wear acrylic nails on and off in the past to cover up these issues. Thankfully, that craze is long over; and my nails have benefited ever since by using Barielle. Works well with [[ASIN:B0009ET4HM Barielle Natural Nail Camouflage, .5 fl oz (14.8 ml)]]</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it does work well, My nails were a mess &amp; embarrassing, now they look nice. I would recommend ut,</li>
    <li> Not a bad cuticle moisturizer, but useless for strengthening nails.  Didn&#x27;t see any difference in nail strength at all.  Used it daily for about 7-8 months.</li>
    <li> I used this product decades ago and it performed superbly.  I&#x27;ve tried it again recently and had no results.  I got two jars so it got a fair shot.  The cream in one was very yellowed which indicates the product was too old.</li>
    <li> I have used Barielle Nail Strengthener Cream for years and years.  As a nail biter and lactose intolerant person, I had no way to strengthen my nails until I tried this product.  I would not be without it, even on vacation!  I just rub a little cream on my nails each night and I get lots of compliments on my nails.</li>
    <li> My nails used to split and chip easily, but this product really strengthened my nails.  It takes several weeks to see a real effect, but I was willing to commit to the treatment this time around.  In the past I&#x27;ve used strengtheners that are applied as polish (Sally Hanson products used to work for me), but they have lost their effectiveness over time, and my nails actually were in worse shape after using them, splitting frequently.  This creme is a hydrator, and I can see the difference.  Very glad that I tried this.</li>
    <li> Great product and it works!</li>
    <li> Ordered this item several years ago and it worked wonders, this was another order much later.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! This product and the Barielle Intensive Nail Renewal Oil are intended to be gently massaged into the nail for several minutes.</li>
    <li> I had looked for this because it had worked for my nails before.  This product really helps strengthen my weak nails.</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF IS FANTASTIC. IT WORKS EXACTLY AS IT SHOULD. WHITENS AND STRENGTHENS YOUR NAILS!!! I LOVE IT!!! Enough said!</li>
    <li> Good product to help strengthen your nails</li>
    <li> Was having splitting along the ridges of my fingernails. Did not want to use nail strengtheners that are like polish. Was amazed how quickly my nails responded! Am buying extra to have one in the bathroom and one in the kitchen!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful, rich cuticle cream.  I use it every night because I have a tendency to have ragged cuticles if I don&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> This product really helps my nails grow.  I am on my second jar.</li>
    <li> I used Barielle Nail Strengthener years ago and it made my nails strong. I am so glad I found it again on amazon and I&#x27;m happy to say it still works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several months now.  My nails do seem to be a bit stronger, but don&#x27;t grow any faster, or really look any better.  I won&#x27;t purchase again - I&#x27;ll just eat more Jello.</li>
    <li> Works wonders on damaged nails. Make them very healthy and strong. Works great on polished nails. Won&#x27;t go without this product!</li>
    <li> As of 2014 the product I got is the &amp;#34;old recipe&amp;#34;, which is thick with a prominent smell of lanoline.  So I think you can buy this product with confidence that you will get real stuff compared to the watery stuff some people complained about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a classical guitarist.  Good nails are critical to excellent tone. Nails are affected by growth rate versus rate of wear from playing. I practice 2-3 hours daily so, for me, my nails wear down faster than they grow.  This product helps a lot by strengthing the nails so they wear down more slowly and the growth rate now exceeds the rate of wear.  This allows me to maintain optimal length/shape for the best possible tone.  The improved nail strength is obvious, both visually and physically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are lucky enough to have a max growth rate on your nails, then you don&#x27;t need this stuff. If you are like me, you will thank yourself for buying/using this product.  Remember you need a really nutirtious diet too !</li>
    <li> I have used this nail cream for years; getting harder to find it in stores so glad to see it on Amazon.    No matter how dry your cuticles are, this stuff will soften them and daily use will keep them supple.   Really.    I have turned a number of friends on to it and everyone swears by it.   It will soak right into dry cuticles and nails within a few minutes, even if your hands are dry.   Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.    My hands are in water a lot, and this stuff restores my nails and cuticles like nothing else.</li>
    <li> I tried this product after using artificial nails continuously for more than 15 years.  I used it 3-4 times a day for months.  My nails are strong and&lt;br /&gt;beautiful. I also  take biotin and apply Pink Armour every other day. My manicure lasts a week.</li>
    <li> This is the most wonderful nail product I&#x27;ve ever used. Very effective and easy to use. Remains for a long time. Does not smell bad. Is not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hands a lot and I like wearing nail polish all the time, and I always had very good nails until about two months ago when my nails started peeling and breaking, so I stopped wearing nail polish, but it didn&#x27;t help. So I bought this product for its good reviews and I can&#x27;t tell enough good about it. Very helpful. I used it almost every night for about a month and my nails are bullet proof! Nice and long and healthy. I highly recommend this product in addition to the protein nail builder from the same brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over 15 years. Every time I stop my weak nails get more splitting, tearing &amp; my cuticles get ragged. Very good product.</li>
    <li> Not the same formula. Oily, thin and really stinky. I am returning this product and hope to find the real deal some where else.</li>
    <li> This purchase of Barielle was old, rancid and does not work.  It was not even the same consistency as previous purchases.  I will not order from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> I had only been using the product for a couple of weeks, but I have seen very noticeable improvement in my nails.  They are much stronger and healthier.  I bought this, the nail hardener, and the nail thickener.  They are working well together.</li>
    <li> I found the other reviews helpful, so I purchased this cream.  I just purchased my second jar.  My nails were pretty bad to due abuse by wearing acrylics.  I just started nursing school and the Dean said, &amp;#34;No Fake Nails.&amp;#34;  I am now forced to have naked nails and this cream has been a life saver.  I put it on every night before I go to bed and it works!  My nails look healthy and they are stronger.  I have less snags, tears and rips.  I just ordered the Barielle Fortifying Nail Builder in the hopes that it works in conjunction with this cream.  So far, it has been well worth the money and trouble.  I would recommend to a friend.  I rarely post reviews, but was so pleased, I thought I would share my comments.  It has been 45 days and I see a big improvement.</li>
    <li> Barielle Nail Strengthener Cream is the only thing that helps my mother&#x27;s fragile nails. She was so excited when I gave some to her for Christmas!&lt;br /&gt;I have also found this to be helpful for my tough cuticles, as it makes them soft instead of having hangnails. Don&#x27;t know why, but it makes nails stronger, and cuticles feel the way they should.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice, too.</li>
    <li> One of the products was very dry the others were fine.  Seemed old others in the order were more like normal.</li>
    <li> This cream may or may not strengthen nails is you use it every day, but I find it too inconvenient to use daily because your hands become very sticky after application.</li>
    <li> this is the only thing that&#x27;s makes my nails happen. I have weak, splitting nails and this makes them grow strong and healthy.</li>
    <li> I grew up using Barielle products --and if You ever used the Kiehl cuticle cream you will love this one! I cannot get enough of the hand cream!</li>
    <li> Very Good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barbara</li>
    <li> It sucked. Didn&#x27;t work at all. Just a cream that doesn&#x27;t even moisturize. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Not sure how they even got all these stars.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine suggested I try this stuff.  I&#x27;ve tried everything on my thin nails.  I put the cream on my unpolished nails at night and, since using it, I&#x27;ve had fewer breaks.  I have learned that nail polish, rather than help my nails, makes them peel and break.  So the combo of regularly tending them, keeping polish off of them and using this cream, I finally have hands I&#x27;m not ashamed of.  Believe me, this is truly something I&#x27;ll keep on hand from now on.  Oh and it arrived very quickly.  So I was impressed with the service too!  Win-win, wouldn&#x27;t you say?!?</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product quite long enough to know for sure if the claims for stronger nails are justified.  Can&#x27;t give it five stars for that reason but, at the very least, it seems to be an excellent cuticle cream.  I do a lot of gardening and cleaning, don&#x27;t always remember to wear gloves, so I&#x27;m prone to dry cuticles and hangnails.  This cream is very good at keeping my cuticles soft and smooth, and my nails do appear to be less prone to peeling off in layers.</li>
    <li> As with the other nail hardening product that I purchased, it simply DOES NOT WORK!  I haveused it every day for weeks without ANY result.  My nails continue to crack and break  with the slightest physical cause.  This is another product for the circular file!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works really well!</li>
    <li> There is NOTHING like this on the market - my nails are so thin, this keeps them in good condition and just takes a moment to apply.  It absorbs easily and quickly and makes all the difference!</li>
    <li> I have used this for years. I am glad Amazon carries it. Put it on your fingernails at night and they will be strionger by morning. The container lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> I have had chronic problems with splitting nails for years. I bought this product and then failed to use it for quite some time. Several months ago I started using it and within a week or two saw a huge difference. Stronger nails, no more splitting. I got lazy, stopped using it, and things went down hill. I am now using it again with the same great results. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Every time my nails start to get brittle and break, I think, &amp;#34;Why am I not using that cream?&amp;#34; When I use it religiously every night, after about a month, I notice a difference. The nail tips get whiter and look much better. I would give it a good 8 weeks to really see a difference. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This cream is awesome and I could tell my nails were stronger after a day.  I also like the fact that you don&#x27;t have to remove it at the end of the week like other products I have purchased.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this product on Amazon. I used it years ago but then couldn&#x27;t find it. Plus it was considerably more expensive. Have nails now that I haven&#x27;t had in years after wearing gelish nail polish for a few years. My nails were paper thin. Using the Bariella cream has softened my cubicles and stopped the splitting.</li>
    <li> For the last few years I have struggled with peeling and brittle nails. This cream has worked wonders for my nails. I will be a cistomer for life!!</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping!  Love this product.</li>
    <li> This cream really works!  It softens your cuticles and strengthens nails.  It also helps to soften the skin around the nails and prevents painful cracks.</li>
    <li> I found this product years ago after reading about it somewhere.  I tried it and it worked pretty well, but then I moved and couldn&#x27;t find it for several years.  I wised up and looked online.  Happily I found it again and am using it again.  My complaint is that the cream seems thin and doesn&#x27;t seem to coat my nails as much as I&#x27;d like.  I&#x27;m going to keep using it and see if it does the job as well as another product I&#x27;m trying.</li>
    <li> Have been using twice daily and my nails feel like they are getting stronger.</li>
    <li> My nails are weak and have tried it for a while, but so far have not seen noticeable improvement.  My nails does not look as dry, but still have not gotten stronger as I would have hoped for.</li>
    <li> I love this product and put it on my nails almost every single night.  The health of my nails has improved since I started using it.</li>
    <li> How I used to love this cream! It was very thick and a little dab would go a long way. It used to be incredibly moisturizing and a small jar would last forever. My most recent purchase was in May 2011 and boy has this changed! I have an old jar and a new jar - both LOOK identical from the outside, same size, same writing, same everything. Inside, the difference is night and day. The old stuff is soooo much better. It has a unique smell because it contains lanolin. The new jar has no smell whatsoever. The cream is very very thin and does not moisturize well at all. I have to use 3x the amount of the new cream to get barely any effect. I am so disappointed that they changed the formula. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE! For what it is NOW, the price is simply OUTRAGEOUS! I could by a drugstore cream for 1/3 of the price and get the same or better results. SHAME ON YOU, BARIELLE!</li>
    <li> This is my second jar of this product.  I think it has made a positive difference in the condition of my nails.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a month now and it really hasn&#x27;t changed the way my nails break off, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth buying.  I hope other people are getting better results. Nothing wrong with it, just hasn&#x27;t done anything for my nails.</li>
    <li> I have used this product only a week, but I think there is improvement in my nails</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  I have horrible weak nails, but after just a couple of weeks they are so much stronger.</li>
    <li> Over the past year, I had gel french nails done bi-weekly in a salon, unfortunately, after about 1 year, my nails were burning, which I know is due to filing/sanding. I did tons of research and came up with a non-salon regimen that works for me. I use Hoofmaker Hand and Nail lotion, Nailtiques Plus 2, Zeva Crystal file, and Zeva Nail Brite. Finally, I use 2 different cuticle cream a few x&#x27;s per day - Barielle cuticle cream. Barielle&#x27;s cuticle cream dries nicely. All of this together has made a huge difference. I never thought it was possible to have natural nails that actually looked nice.</li>
    <li> Did not strengthen nails.</li>
    <li> Fabulous cuticle cream and I have tried them all - you will love this product!</li>
    <li> Never had decent nails- went to acrylics for 16 years - Big mistake!&lt;br /&gt;Found this product through a salon and began using: after I came to my senses and removed the artificial ones.&lt;br /&gt;Second container - certainly seems to strengthen the nails. Use twice a week</li>
    <li> This is a great product but must be used for several months to allow your new nails to grow out.  This is a good supplier.  I had purchased this before from a different supplier and it was beige and very thick like old-fashioned furniture wax.  But what did I know?  I reordered it from this supplier and surprise!!! - It is white and very creamy as I had originally expected.  I would like to see an expiration date on the product to prevent this from happening again.</li>
    <li> I love this product and had to search for it at high end retail stores. The cost is very reasonable. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the legitimate product.  If you look at the Barielle website, the real product has a small horse on the label on the left, not a gold horse on the right.  Plus, when using the product, the color on the jar&#x27;s label rubs off on your fingers.  From the first time I used this, my fingers had a blue stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not the real deal.  Buyer beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, just went to return the item.  They make you pay postage to return it.  You are going to pay more than what you paid for the item.  This is not legit.  I&#x27;m going to the Barielle website.  It might cost me a bit more, but I&#x27;ll get the actual product, not some cheap cream Miss Pink Cat buys at the dollar store and slops into a cheap jar.</li>
    <li> The best nail cream ever. Softens cuticles and strengthens nails.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Makes nail Stronger and less likely to peel. I have used it for years If I stop I have all the above symptoms.</li>
    <li> I love Barielle Nail creams, but this one arrived totally rancid with color dark yellow and smelling badly. I ordered two jars trusting its quality, and returned them both for refund.&lt;br /&gt;I think, that the company that is distributing it will be more aware of the quality of this product its shelf life and not sell it if it&#x27;s over the due date. In fact there was no date of expiration on this creams.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Its the best product on the market.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t last long.  hard to tell what it is doing.  assume well.</li>
    <li> Used it for years. Very good</li>
    <li> Used it years ago and had beautiful nails.  Couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore, but got it from Amazon&lt;br /&gt;and it still strengthens my nails so they can grow and look nice.</li>
    <li> This nail strengthener cream worked like magic on my nails.  My granddaughter and I had gotten &amp;#34;Mani&#x27;s&amp;#34; together and it was suggested I try a gel polish.  No one told me it was impossible to take off with regular polish remover.  I finally went to a manicurist and she scrapped the polish off after soaking my nails in special polish remover.  It looked like someone had just sanded them with sand paper and not very smoothly.  I tried a number of things to improve my nails, but it wasn&#x27;t till I got this product that things improved...immediately.  The first time I put it on, my nails soaked it up in minutes.  I knew I was on the right track.  I&#x27;ve used it almost every night for the past several months and all but my index finger are growing normally.  I think the problem with the index finger is that I unconsciously use it as a tool sometimes.  But now it&#x27;s grown to be the same length as my others.  I did have to trim and file my nails as the damaged part grew out, but all is good for now.  It&#x27;s taken me several months to achieve this, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> This cream is wonderful!  It makes nails strong and flexible.  When I use it regularly, my nails are not brittle and able to grow.</li>
    <li> I have used Barielle for years and won&#x27;t be without it. I recommend it to my friends who have dry cuticles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve written off Barielle as the most high priced gimmick products I&#x27;ve ever tried.  This doesn&#x27;t do a darned thing.  It&#x27;s greasy, oily, and if it worked, I&#x27;d deal with it, but it does nothing.  I&#x27;m sick that I spent the money.  Don&#x27;t spend yours on this.  There&#x27;s another product sold here on Amazon called Carmichel&#x27;s Cuticle Cream.  I&#x27;ve used that for 20 years or so and it does work.  I was experimenting again, and I should know better.  So I bought two little tubs of Carmichaels (or Carmichel&#x27;s) and my nails are better again.  I just don&#x27;t know how this brand stays in business.  They won&#x27;t be getting mine again, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find this for years--had it a long time ago and I finally found it on Amazon.  Go figure.  I recommend it for anyone with weak, splitting nails.  Just rub it in at least once a day--you&#x27;ll be amazed at difference in 1 or two weeks.</li>
    <li> Since you can&#x27;t find this in stores any longer, it was nice to find it online. Tried and true old school product for suffering nails.</li>
    <li> My manly nails split and/or crack all the time in the winter. This cream is amazing! I&#x27;ve only had a few minor chips in the two months I&#x27;ve been using it. It seems to make the rest of the nail stronger so that when there is a chip it doesn&#x27;t take off half of your nail. Definitely recommend &amp; will use as long as they make it!</li>
    <li> i used it every single day for about a month and it didn&#x27;t work on my nails i cant see a difference. they are still weak.</li>
    <li> Good product .. fast shipping ..</li>
    <li> I have had this cream for about 2-1/2 weeks and it really feels like it is strengthening my finger nails. Every time I sit down I put a little on each nail and rub it into my cuticles as well, and they are not peeling or splitting like they were before I started using Barielle.  I am thrilled with the improvement and my hands are looking much improved.  I would recommend it for anyone with nails that are difficult to grow.</li>
    <li> Barielle Nail Strengthener creamI found great improvement to my nails.I have recommended it to others. Even my husband uses it. Good to hear from you.</li>
    <li> Very pleased.  This is my second jar and my nails are responding well.  Will definitely reorder as I&#x27;m very pleased.  Great!</li>
    <li> Nice to use, but results not clear.</li>
    <li> I put the cream on my hands as many times a day as I can remember especially before I put my rubber gloves on to wash dishes and I think it has really helped.</li>
    <li> This cream although feels great when I put it on, I do not see or feel any difference with my nails. They are still soft, peeling and breaking!  I even try to put on a nail hardener after applying the cream. I have been using it at least twice a day if not more...&lt;br /&gt;sorry wish it worked better...I do need something to help these nails!</li>
    <li> ,,,, but not greasy.  I don&#x27;t have to wait for it to absorb before picking up my book each nite!</li>
    <li> I frequently experienced cracked nails, no longer with strengthener cream. I have used this product for 3 years and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Very good product - I&#x27;ve used it for a long time.  It gets harder to find....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years. It does exactly what it says it does, and I have the nice long hard fingernails to prove it!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t quite work for me but the formula was nice &amp; easy on my nails which is what I liked about it.</li>
    <li> Love the Barielle nail cream!!  It restored my nails after having had gel nails on for 45 days.  I have used it at least once a day for a couple months, and they look new &amp; much stronger.  I started noticing a difference in strength in a couple weeks.  But as soon as you put cream on nails, it nourishes them &amp; they look so much better.  Will always stay committed to the Barielle nail cream.  Amazon&#x27;s pricing was the least in cost.  This size is great for using @ home or traveling.</li>
    <li> Received very quickly, in perfect condition.  Works very well on dry cuticles and nails.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I used this product once, years ago, but lost the jar before I could extract any meaningful results.  I don&#x27;t recall if I had any problems with the texture or fragrance at that time.  So, I decided to give it another try.  I figured it would be a nice augmentation to my Nailtiques routine.  I&#x27;m happy with Nailtiques, but as Mae West said, \\&quot;too much of a good thing can be wonderful.\\&quot; Well, last night I received my new jar...YUCK.  The texture was greasy and it stunk.  The formula must&#x27;ve changed...for the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t stray again.</li>
    <li> I have struggled for a long time with brittle nails. I used to try to use gels or acrylics to let them grow out and stop the temptation to mess with or bite them but all in all fake nails really do more harm than good. This cream is easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t take much for each application. I&#x27;ve seen substantial improvement over the last 4 or 5 months I&#x27;ve been utilizing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the topical approach I&#x27;ve also begun taking biotin supplements ([[ASIN:B00BYNGI5I Free Natrol Biotin - 10,000 mcg Tablets + Hair Growth Essentials - 60 capsules - Promotes Hair Growth, Healthy Skin, and Strong Nails]]) to help as well. The combination of attacking the problem from multiple directions seems to be paying off. My nails have a lot more strength and seem to grow longer as well. It benefits your skin and hair too which is just another added bonus :)</li>
    <li> Works well on my nails so far, but we will see in the long run. Tiny jar for the price though.</li>
    <li> Did not work as well as I expected.  The professional version works better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it works beautifully.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working well!</li>
    <li> This stuff works beautifully.</li>
    <li> It was fresh &amp; nice and creamy.  Last time I bought it on a different site, it was very solidified &amp; difficult to use.  I have always liked this product.  It&#x27;s the only way I can have nails that grow out &amp; look nice with a manicure.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how strong my nails are. I use this twice a day (morning and night). I started using this when my acrylics were removed. The portion of the nail that is still thin from drilling is like a strong nail. I am so excited. I thought I was going to have to go the whole 3 months with ugly nails, but instead could use the ones that were damaged. SO HAPPY!</li>
    <li> Kind of Dissapointed&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product base of the many positive reviews. However, in my case it only work for a couple of weeks. My nails started to grow but noticed that they were not hard and to make it worst every week a nail will break from the root. I found myself cutting my nails more often that I wanted to. Sorry, for only two stars it work for others, but it did not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My search will continued. Are there any recommendations out there?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
    <li> After a month I dint see much if a difference it might just not be notisable but yeah not sure about it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried for years to strengthen my fingernails to no avail..  This is my second jar and I don&#x27;t intend to ever be without it, for it works absolutely wonderfully!!  I have lovely fingernails for the first time in years and years!!  It is wonderful!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this several times a day for over a month. I don&#x27;t necessarily notice anymore strength in my nails. I work in the medical field and through repetitive hand washing have noticed this seems to protect my nails and my cuticals look much better.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to treat my flaking nails and this worked very well. I appplied a small amount of cream each night before bed and within two weeks my nails are much stronger and all chipping/peeling is gone!</li>
    <li> An old friend I haven&#x27;t used in forever.  I started taking Biotin to help hair and nails and recently remember this favorite so thought I&#x27;d try it for my nails.  Still works great and is a trusted product.</li>
    <li> Reasonable price, accurate description, quick delivery. A+</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many many years.  At some point I stopped, not sure why.  I am back to use it. You just rub it in to your nails, best time is just before bed so it can really sink in.  The results are amazing.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 50 years.  Besides strengthening your nails, it eliminates excess cuticle.  Hence I never need a manicure unless I want pampering.  At first you should smear a little on your nails and cuticles nightly.  After a while, once or twice a week is sufficient.  The product lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get my dry, ridged nails to grow at all until I started using Barielle Nail Strengthener daily.  I&#x27;ve seen a huge improvement and this nail Strengthener gets all the credit.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> It is the only thing that ever helps my nails when they continually break off below the quick and peel etc.</li>
    <li> IF I REMEMBER TO USE IT, THIS IS A TRIED AND TRUE WAY TO GROW LONGER, STRONGER NAILS IN A SHORT TIME.</li>
    <li> I have not used this product long enough to know if it works. Have tried a lot of products for the nails  and been disappointed so have high hopes for this one.</li>
    <li> For mt mother-in-law. She loves it.</li>
    <li> Enough said. You don&#x27;t use a product that you can only buy via mail-order for 25 years if you don&#x27;t love it.</li>
    <li> I had heard great reviews for this product and figured I&#x27;d try it. You have to use it for a while. I used it for about 7 weeks before seeing any difference. My nails are very soft and they bend and tear easily. They never grow very long. And grow very slowly. Admittedly, my nails were longer than they have ever been using this product. (Which still wasn&#x27;t too long) But eventually, they all got tears while making the bed or doing laundry. I think based on the thickness of this product, it&#x27;s meant more for people with brittle nails that chip or crack.</li>
    <li> This is not what I expected from the Barielle product. I&#x27;ve been using this cream for years and it&#x27;s never been runny and yellow in color. It&#x27;s always been white and thick cream. I am returning this to you for a credit. I spoke to someone at Barielle and they said it was probably from the bad batch that they recalled. Looks like my order was not returned in the recall.</li>
    <li> I had such high hopes after reading some of the reviews.  Should have paid more attention to the lower ratings.  I&#x27;ve had this product for several months now and gave it plenty of time to work.  Followed the directions VERY carefully.  There is no difference in the splitting/layering of my nails.  To me it&#x27;s just a high priced moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Second purchase and will keep it on my list for future purchases - it works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried a nail strengthening cream before, but I&#x27;m glad I tried this one. Easy to just rub on in the evening while watching TV or reading and it really seems to work.</li>
    <li> it works, especially in the winter for brittle nails</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I had nails that were splitting. I put this on a few times a day for a couple of weeks and the split was gone. I have to keep using it, but it is exactly what I need.</li>
    <li> good stuff for winter-dried nails.</li>
