<li> Now all I can find in this line of Revlon blushes are the most GAUDY and DISGUSTING colors that I can&#x27;t imagine any woman really wearing.  </li>
<li> Another one of my favorite shades Revlon did away with :(</li>
<li> The supposed replacement colors were ALL too dark for me.</li>
<li> This blush was just the color I always buy, but it was not available in my area.</li>
<li> Was disappointed when it became hard to find but was so thankful when I found it was available through Amazon.</li>
<li> This color blush is hard to find</li>
<li> So stupid of Revlon to discontinue it and replace it with a gawdy new color.  </li>
<li> I barely used up the previous one I got which I hated.</li>
<li> And I was disappointed that I couldn&#x27;t find it in my local stores.  </li>
<li> Im the type that sticks with something that I like and have trouble with change!!!</li>
<li> but, sadly it has been discontinued :(</li>

    <li> Another one of my favorite shades Revlon did away with :(</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I ordered this one again. Thought I could finally get out of this. It almost shows no color at all. I barely used up the previous one I got which I hated. And now another one, thinking to return it.</li>
    <li> I like this color because it seems more natural that other colors</li>

    <li> Can&#x27;t seem to find this color in stores.  It&#x27;s an old favorite of Revlon&#x27;s and mine as well.  Color goes well with everything.  So does wine!!</li>
    <li> this is the only blush my wife will buy.  she cant find this blush anywhere but on Amazon.</li>

    <li> Shipped as planned. Not broken</li>
    <li> Wish that Revlon still made this color</li>
    <li> Revlon does not seem to carry this shade in regular stores.  No other shade works well for me.</li>
    <li> This color blush is hard to find so I was happy I could get it.  The color looks nice on fair skin.</li>
    <li> It has been my favorite for many years.  So stupid of Revlon to discontinue it and replace it with a gawdy new color.  I am so happy that I was able to buy this bargain from you, and will continue to search you for additional items. I have several friends who also use this color blush, and I expect you will hear from them too.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Item was shipped quickly. Product is as described.</li>
    <li> I have used this blush color for YEARS and LOVE IT..but, sadly it has been discontinued :( I must buy more, if, I can find it..it seems like all of my tried and true products are disappearing..Im the type that sticks with something that I like and have trouble with change!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product and color.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Color is perfect blend for my skin tone!</li>
    <li> exactly what I asked for! Love it!</li>
    <li> (Purchased for my wife, who loves it.)</li>
    <li> This is the only Revlon product I have ever used  However, I have used Revlon Powder Blush #060 Wine With Everything for around 20 years.  The powder goes on very nicely and it appears very natural with my complication. The compact is fairly sturdy.  The brush provided is just adequate, I use my own. The mirror on the case is a joke. Still I have used this blush for so long because of the great color and consistency of the powder.  Unfortunately, of late I have not been able to find this particular color, so with no regard to thousands of women who dearly LOVE this color, it would appear Revlon has discontinued the color #060 Wine With Everything.  This is amazing to me because I know this color has been a good seller all through the years, it was always the one I&#x27;d find sold out from the shelves.  Now all I can find in this line of Revlon blushes are the most GAUDY and DISGUSTING colors that I can&#x27;t imagine any woman really wearing.  Revlon would do well to replace this color to their line.  When my remnants are finally all gone....I will find something as similar as possible as far as matching is color by ANOTHER manufacturer.</li>
    <li> A color they should never have stopped making -  It&#x27;s incredible and work on everyone. Boo Revlon for discontinuing!</li>
    <li> Love it !! Great color,  hard to find in the stores.</li>
    <li> So glad to have found this online!!</li>
    <li> Been using shade for years now I can&#x27;t find it anywhere. I believe it was discontinued  It was a very popular item I don&#x27;t know why they aren&#x27;t making any longer</li>
    <li> Really nice blushed rose color.</li>
    <li> I love this blush.  It&#x27;s the right color for my skin and is easily applied.  It lasts a LONG time, which I am grateful for, and only needs an occasional re-application.</li>
    <li> Love It. Just wish companies would quit discontinuing shades all the time.</li>
    <li> I love using Revelon Wine with everything powder blush. It is definitely my color and I hope you never discontinue it.</li>
    <li> I love this! .  I can&#x27;t believe they are discontinuing this color.  It&#x27;s my favorite color and the only color I have used for years!</li>
    <li> Fast ship.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I love this color but it must have been discontinued in stores as I have not been&lt;br /&gt;able to find it - it&#x27;s the only color I like so was happy to find it on Amazon</li>
