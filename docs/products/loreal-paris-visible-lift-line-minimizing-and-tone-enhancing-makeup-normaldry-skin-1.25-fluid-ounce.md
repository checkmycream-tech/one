      <li>I have been using this foundation for years and absolutely love it.  </li>
      <li>I have tried all the big brand names but this foundation is PERFECT.</li>
      <li>I have OK skin for my age but</li>
      <li>I use to love Max Factor</li>
      <li>I had used this before, it is very creamy and coverage is great.</li>
      <li>Love Loreal.</li>
      <li>This is the only one that I LOVE!!!</li>
      <li>I loved this product match me very well.</li>
      <li>It gives a light, smooth coverage that evens the skin tone and hides minor imperfections beautifully!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything and people think I have beautiful skin and look much younger than I am with this foundation.  </li>
      <li>and it even arrived sooner than expected she is quite happy with it and are so glad to have found the makeup she is used to and likes</li>
      <li>but mine was too light.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy to have found my regular \\&quot;old style\\&quot; make-up at Amazon.</li>
      <li>Also I have large pores on top of the drying of age.</li>
      <li>This foundation gives the best coverage of any foundation out there, even the extremely more expensive brands.  </li>
      <li>I use a sponge to apply and it seems to blend quickly.</li>
      <li>in certain light most make my face look very saggy and lined.</li>
      <li>The new formula, color(s) and packaging is not as good as the old product.</li>
      <li>It was worth the money.........</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s my even worth the time</li>
      <li>I love how natural it looks.  </li>
      <li>Or, am I the only old lady that cares about looking great?</li>
      <li>picking the right color.</li>
      <li>If you find your right shade, it&#x27;s almost perfection.</li>
      <li>Anyway, I bought this on advise of a friend and she was right.</li>
      <li>Very reasonable.</li>
      <li>Had serum inside, which I wasn&#x27;t aware of.</li>
      <li>I bought the shade called Shell and it is great for my light skin that needs a little pink glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Too oily also looked very old !!</li>
      <li>FAST DELIVERY AND</li>
      <li>You would think with all the baby-boomers all the cosmetic lines would use a 70 plus model to really capture our market.</li>
      <li>The foundation really does cover well and matched with the line minimizing powder, they cover the lines well.</li>
      <li>The new visible lift is nothing like this product.  </li>
      <li>It lasts nearly all day, too.</li>
      <li>It is the proper shade but the makeup feels different than it normally does.  </li>
      <li>Too light and somewhat thick</li>
      <li>I usually get a lighter color for the winter and a slightly darker tone for the summer when I have more color from the sun.  </li>

    <li> This foundation gives the best coverage of any foundation out there, even the extremely more expensive brands.  I usually get a lighter color for the winter and a slightly darker tone for the summer when I have more color from the sun.  The feel is not at all greasy or shiny.  It lasts nearly all day, too.</li>
    <li> Not enough coverage for me.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this makeup for years, but until recently, we&#x27;ve been getting it from Walmart for about $13! GREAT price, and came quickly! I will be ordering more bottles for her from this site ... well, forever! (I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;tight-wad&amp;#34; lol)</li>
    <li> It was worth the money.........</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this before.  Top quality,get coverage.</li>
    <li> Too light and somewhat thick</li>
    <li> my mother really liked this makeup and after searching for it in stores I was thrilled to find it here for a great price and it even arrived sooner than expected she is quite happy with it and are so glad to have found the makeup she is used to and likes</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, great coverage and blends nicely. Gives the skin a nice glow! I won&#x27;t go back to other foundations.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for all day wear. It does not transfer to clothing. It gives a light, smooth coverage that evens the skin tone and hides minor imperfections beautifully! Five stars!</li>
    <li> Dissapointing!From marks inside the cap realized my item was previously openned and used!&lt;br /&gt;Did not even have a chance to try it because I am not applying something that might cause some skin problems(infections etc.) on my face.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal has unfortunately re-formulated &amp; re-packaged this make-up. The new formula, color(s) and packaging is not as good as the old product. I&#x27;m very happy to have found my regular \\&quot;old style\\&quot; make-up at Amazon. Very good seller too!</li>
    <li> Too oily also looked very old !! I would send it back but it&#x27;s my even worth the time</li>
    <li> Coverage is good....but mine was too light. It really isn&#x27;t the fault of the product, I have learned that buying it over line was not the best idea. Good price, good covereage but good luck picking the right color.</li>
    <li> FAST DELIVERY AND JUST AS DESCRIBED</li>
    <li> I buy Loreal makeup all the time.  Bought this because of the great price.  It is the proper shade but the makeup feels different than it normally does.  I will let give it a few days but not sure this was worth saving a few dollars.</li>
    <li> I have been using this foundation for years and absolutely love it.  I bought it at Amazon because their price is better than the stores!!!!!  I also sent one to my daughter in another state and she loves the coverage too.</li>
    <li> I have tried countless brands out there.  This is the only one that I LOVE!!! I love how natural it looks.  If you find your right shade, it&#x27;s almost perfection. It moisturizes your skin and it has SPF which is always nice!  It&#x27;s really inexpensive and a little bit goes long ways.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years,  perfect for me!</li>
    <li> good price, quick delivery...wife is happy.</li>
    <li> The color is just as displayed. A little goes a long way with this base. I use a sponge to apply and it seems to blend quickly.</li>
    <li> OMG. I have tried all the big brand names but this foundation is PERFECT. I have OK skin for my age but in certain light most make my face look very saggy and lined. Also I have large pores on top of the drying of age. Tried Merle Norman, Estee Lauder, Channel, Avon. I use to love Max Factor Long Lasting until they discontinued. Anyway, I bought this on advise of a friend and she was right. It is so PERFECT. Not a matt finish but just a glow. I bought the shade called Shell and it is great for my light skin that needs a little pink glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went to a town meeting and the woman next to me asked \\&quot;What do you do for your skin?\\&quot;. I am just thrilled. You would think with all the baby-boomers all the cosmetic lines would use a 70 plus model to really capture our market. Or, am I the only old lady that cares about looking great? I paid $13.99 at Walmart so Amazon has a good price.</li>
    <li> The new visible lift is nothing like this product.  I&#x27;ve tried everything and people think I have beautiful skin and look much younger than I am with this foundation.  It&#x27;s thick, but not heavy or greasy.  I have dry skin and this works beautifully for me.</li>
    <li> The foundation really does cover well and matched with the line minimizing powder, they cover the lines well. I am allergic to many products and this one makes my skin feel good.</li>
    <li> I like the coverage. I should have ordered a different shade. My skin is oily even at my age and the make up feels dry when I apply it, but I like that it has the lifting serum .</li>
    <li> Very pleased. Helped cover face flaws.</li>
    <li> I had used this before, it is very creamy and coverage is great. Just as described. Love Loreal. Very reasonable.</li>
    <li> I loved this product match me very well. I will purshace again</li>
    <li> I wish they had this product in the store because its great!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what was advertised! Had serum inside, which I wasn&#x27;t aware of. Very disappointed!</li>
