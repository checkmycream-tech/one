      <li>These do the job effectively and can be used with any cleanser.  </li>
      <li>My daughter&#x27;s nose and chin was getting kind of bumpy.  </li>
      <li>Buf Puf is what has kept my skin looking so good for so many years.  </li>
      <li>I liked the fact that it was a 6 pack.</li>
      <li>Top quality pads by 3M.  Good for scrubbing to prevent acne.  </li>
      <li>Even my husband has his own pad.</li>
      <li>These are the absolute best.</li>
      <li>They are especially useful on the days I have used sunscreen to help remove the gunk.  </li>
      <li>lasts a long time and this makes my wife happy, happy wife happy life</li>
      <li>Been using these for years and they clean and exfoliate great.</li>
      <li>but you better first try both varieties and decide which one is best for your skin.</li>
      <li>I have used these before and like using them.&lt;br /&gt;Happy to be able to get hold of them again.&lt;br /&gt;Not popular in NZ</li>
      <li>Great value -well worth the price</li>
      <li>The size is a good fit for my hand</li>
      <li>The ability to buy bulk ensures I always have my favorite face scrubbers handy.  </li>
      <li>it exfoliates more effectively that anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried it all.</li>
      <li>Just a super product, I would be more than happy to recommend product to anyone,</li>
      <li>Love, love, love!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll have to read more to see if they&#x27;ll be suitable as I would think they&#x27;d help her a lot.  </li>
      <li>There are MANY substitutes - but NOTHING is as good as the original Buf-Puf.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s fine with me!  </li>

      <li>Just love how my skin feels after I use this sponge.</li>
      <li>Love these.</li>
      <li>This was a much better deal.</li>
      <li>There are many imitators but none have lasted me longer than a week.  </li>
      <li>I feel that Buf Puf scrubs away the dirt off my face more than just washing alone with my hands.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m actually quite impressed.</li>

      <li>They are a better, smoother quality then the knock-offs.</li>
      <li>I use it with my favorite soap once a week.  </li>
      <li>I love these manual microdermabrasion sponges.  </li>
      <li>I love them.  </li>
      <li>In this case, Amazon was more affordable than 3M.  </li>
      <li>Love these.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I just wasn&#x27;t removing all my makeup at the end of the day.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
      <li>I love this 3M product.  </li>
      <li>I love these.</li>
      <li>Love washing my face with the Buf-Puf</li>
      <li>I love them.</li>
      <li>I use my Buf-Puf every day, have been for many years.</li>
      <li>I love that I can get 6 and stock up as others in my family use them as well.</li>
      <li>So glad Amazon carries them since I can no longer find them in any store.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why I can&#x27;t seem to find these at Wal-Mart or Target anymore, but I&#x27;m glad I could get them on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did</li>
      <li>I am so greatful they are available through Amazon!</li>
      <li>and I still love them.</li>
      <li>I love this product...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure part of it is genetics</li>
      <li>but so glad I didn&#x27;t spend the money.  </li>
      <li>I have very oily skin and these work great for me.</li>
      <li>I love my buf-puf.  </li>
      <li>I love using these sponges.</li>
      <li>I will use these until I am no longer able to wash my face.</li>
      <li>My skin looks better than either of my two sisters who have had work done.</li>
      <li>He was able to tell me everything about the history of my face just by looking at it.</li>
      <li>Used these for years ~ love that it cleans and exfoliates.</li>
      <li>Glad i looked on Amazon.</li>
      <li>It keeps his face clean and fairly acne free.  </li>
      <li>When I first used this product I loved what it did for my face.  </li>
      <li>I use it everyday with my own soap, and my skin feels great!</li>
      <li>After using these, my forehead fine lines were more noticeable.</li>
      <li>Very good facial sponge.</li>
      <li>If you have gentler skin, I recommend the two more lady like Buf Puf models available.    </li>
      <li>Works great - my skin has been clear since using these, even through hormonal acne.  </li>
      <li>You used to be able to get cheap knockoffs that were almost identical, but I&#x27;ve found the quality of these has gone downhill, and you get a face sponge that shreds after about a week&#x27;s use.  </li>
      <li>I was satisfied with this transaction and continue to purchase from this seller when available.</li>
      <li>I now have a good supply and at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Good product, fast delivery</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good to change them out (they do wear out), though depending on how much they are used--they can be used longer than directed on instructions.</li>
      <li>Then daily is great and will yield wonderful benefits of fresh, soft skin.</li>
      <li>Other than that this product is awesome</li>
      <li>They are great for exfoliating and leave my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>And the pack of 6 is really also the most cost effective idea.</li>
      <li>Be sure to use them gently as they could irritate your skin if you were to enthusiastic .</li>
      <li>If you want flawless soft skin I highly recommend these.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>One review said that it helped with fine lines and wrinkles...</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>and it is still fine.</li>
      <li>course I am paying more for these sponges, but they do not soften as quickly as the bargain brands.</li>
      <li>With Super Saver shipping, I can get just what I want, EZ!</li>
      <li>Just use it with your favorite mild soap &amp; you are set!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Been using Buf-Puf since we got a free sample in the mail when I was 16 - over 30 years ago.</li>
      <li>I was fortunate to find it on line.</li>
      <li>the savings available through purchasing the multi-pack, I think I&#x27;m going to stick with the \\&quot;real\\&quot; Buf-Pufs from here on.</li>
      <li>These are genuine buff puffs --- not knock offs.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really fantastic for feet.  </li>
      <li>My face feels smooth after using this.  </li>
      <li>and I noticed my face didn&#x27;t feel as smooth while I was without a buf-puf.  </li>
      <li>Used regularly it makes your skin look great</li>
      <li>- my skin is so happy to have my Buf-Puf back.</li>
      <li>My skin is so smooth now.</li>
      <li>Great facial cleaner!</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find these anywhere, fortunately Amazon had them.</li>
      <li>so far so good.  </li>
      <li>I have used these for many many years in conjuction with Purpose gentle cleansing bar.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really feel like my serums and moisturizers are able to penetrate after using the buff puff instead of sitting on top of my skin.</li>
      <li>Buying these here seem like a good deal too because at the supermarket near my house, these cost about $5.00 each.</li>
      <li>They are wonderful for cleaning off dead skin cells, leaving your face smooth and clean and refreshed for the day.  </li>
      <li>Keeps skin smooth and fresh!</li>
      <li>Your skin feel so clean and smooth after using one.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to find these on Amazon because I can&#x27;t find them in stores.</li>
      <li>You have to have the original.</li>
      <li>I bought the original BUF puf because I know my skin can handle some roughness</li>
      <li>Just feel grungy and not quite clean without my Buf Puf.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Buf-Pufs to clean my face for years.  </li>
      <li>They make my face feel so clean.  </li>
      <li>They gently clean your face day after day.  </li>
      <li>This product exfoliates my skin and always leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
      <li>so i use the sponge to help clean off excess skin cells and oil before shaving.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re face feeling renewed and clean</li>
      <li>Super smooth.</li>
      <li>My face never felt so clean.</li>
      <li>I use it before shaving, to help clean and soften my beard.</li>
      <li>These are by far the best quality facial sponges I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Good mechanical way to slough off old skin and keep face looking fresh.</li>
      <li>My skin is more vibrant and softer since I&#x27;ve been using it!</li>
      <li>So if you want nice soft feet with baby-clean heels, I recommend this.</li>
      <li>This 6-pack was a good deal and will last us about a year.</li>
      <li>Glad to have the real thing.</li>
      <li>The texture does not feel good to the face, but it is so abrasive that it actually works.</li>
      <li>Do go easy the first time using them.  </li>
      <li>For some reason they are really, really hard to find in stores, so it is great to be able to order them online in bulk.</li>
      <li>I like to use it before going to bed, with a mild soap.</li>
      <li>They seem to hold up much better, and the firmness and density are better - they spring back after using and rinsing well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nothing works as well as these pads with a mild soap.</li>
      <li>These are the best daily facial sponges.</li>
      <li>Love how soft my skin feels after using!!</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t beat the super cheap &amp; fast shipping with Prime!</li>
      <li>These facial sponges are great for a mild exfoliation that I truly think keeps my skin looking younger and better.  </li>
      <li>It comes in regular and gentle sponges for the face and they also have a sponge for the body which is especially good for elbows and heels and also makes your skin feel really soft after use.  </li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>cant live without, better than the sonic brushes, at exfoliation.</li>
      <li>Real Buf Puf lasts a minimum of a month, easily.</li>
      <li>Stick with the real thing!!</li>
      <li>So grateful to be able to not only buy it online, but to be able to buy a multi-pak at a much cheaper price!</li>
      <li>I love these easy on your skin, but deep cleaning.</li>
      <li>is very smooth and clear.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an absolutely fantastic product - so much so that I bought a year&#x27;s supply.</li>
      <li>These are so much finer than the cheap drugstore version-</li>
      <li>After he could pinpoint the different ages and areas where I had experienced acne, and told me all the pros and cons of the different medications available, he recommended the Buf-Puf.</li>
      <li>It helps keep my skin fresh feeling.  </li>
      <li>I own a back brush that has a surface that these attach to.</li>
      <li>Some people with more sensitive skin might prefer the gentle version, but I&#x27;ve always gotten good results with the standard.</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin looking fresh.</li>
      <li>I recommend these for any one at any age as you can use your own personal cleanser with these.</li>
      <li>I finally thought to check Amazon for a bulk buy and have been very happy with the price, but happier that I&#x27;m back to the real deal.  </li>
      <li>I begin my facial with a nice cleaning and then move onto the moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>These are not too rough for gentle skin and do a great job of exfoliating.  </li>
      <li>It gets rid of blemishes fairly quickly as well if I&#x27;m consistent with it.</li>
      <li>I suggest a mild cleanser since the pufs can be pretty rigorous (like, don&#x27;t use these with a scrub).</li>
      <li>It helps keeps my skin clean, clear and smooth feeling.</li>
      <li>I have used a Buf-Puf for almost 30 years and they are superior to other sponges out there.</li>
      <li>I was so glad to find them here.the new styled  sponge&#x27;s are no where near as  good and lasting.</li>
      <li>The price was right and it&#x27;s a product she loves.</li>
      <li>REALLY squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>These really make my face feel clean.  </li>
      <li>No other skin-cleaning sponge is better than Buf-Puf for treatment and prevention of acne.  </li>
      <li>Just a quick wash with your favorite cleanser once a daily.</li>
      <li>I went for years not being able to find them in stores (because they don&#x27;t sell them in stores anymore, apparently).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 57 year old male and a friend of mine who is a skin specialist marvels at how good my skin looks and feels.</li>
      <li>Excellent for everyday facial exfoliating.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I use the buff puff with a good facial cleaner in the shower and wow -</li>
      <li>This is an inexpensive way to exfoliate and does a great job so save your money on more expensive options.</li>
      <li>I keep one of these handy, and also the small disposable to keep my skin fresh and blackhead free.  </li>
      <li>Very gentle</li>
      <li>If my skin is sensitive, I may use it every other day, but these work great.</li>
      <li>A little soap or shampoo on your pad and your good to go.  </li>
      <li>Afterwards, your face will feel fresh, soft, and clean.</li>
      <li>After a month of use my first one is still holding up quite well and does a good job on my face with a little bit of soap.</li>
      <li>They are more gentle than the hard sponges and are just as effective.</li>
      <li>and this is a fast, convenient and economical way to purchase them.</li>
      <li>Much exfoliating!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this Buf Puf for 30 years and it&#x27;s never failed me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always liked them and have tried off-brands; none work as well of hold up as long as the &#x27;real deal&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>Worked exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for years and my face is smooth and soft.      </li>
      <li>It helps to exfoliate and make your skin soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Finally, real Buf-Puf&#x27;s!</li>
      <li>I scrub my feet vigorously with it almost every day and it keeps them smooth, soft, and super-clean.  </li>
      <li>I just find that I get more use out of the individual sponges than I do with this one.</li>
      <li>I feel I get more for the money with the individual sponges.</li>
      <li>I use them in the morning and the evening with my favorite facial soaps.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I have used them for many years and they help keep your skin looking younger.</li>
      <li>Keeps skin smooth and young looking.</li>
      <li>I have been using Buf-Puf facial sponges and body sponges for years and love them.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I finally bought</li>
      <li>Our granddaughter was able to get rid of her acne in a short time by using them</li>
      <li>they usually have the cheap kind</li>
      <li>My Friends and family always notice when I use my Buff Puff, my skin really glows!</li>
      <li>back, I have found nothing better.  </li>
      <li>Use them all the time consistently.  </li>
      <li>I have very senstive skin, but these work well!  </li>
      <li>These look like they will hold up pretty well.</li>
      <li>I think this gets the dead skin off as good as any product</li>
      <li>I love buff puff pads because they are the only thing that keeps my skin clean and clear of blackheads.  </li>
      <li>I have been using the Buf-Puf for over 30 years and attribute a far smoother, nearly wrinkle free complexion than most of my (mature) friends.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed the gentle exfoliation and deep cleansing of these pads on a daily basis for many years.  </li>
      <li>Good value, right texture, and long lasting quality.</li>
      <li>(gentle is very gentle)</li>
      <li>OK, Now I&#x27;m starting to sound like a commercial.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and the product was exactly as described.</li>
      <li>The first time I ever used the Buf-Puf, it was recommended to me by a very &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; dermataologist.</li>
      <li>Usual good Amazon service, delivery in 7 or 8 days.</li>
      <li>Love these facial sponges on the with the Avon Clearskin Professional Deep Pore Cleansing Scrub or your favorite cleanser.</li>
      <li>It allows me to sleep with a fresh new skin layer.</li>
      <li>I have used Buff Puffs for over 10 years and have a very clear fresh complexion.</li>
      <li>and 40&#x27;s was certainly exacerbated if not caused by the Buf Puf.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without them!!  </li>
      <li>Remove the outer layer(s) of dead dry skin and you reveal fresher skin that can absorb moisturizer more effectively.</li>
      <li>The Buf-Puf Reusable Facial Sponge is the best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used, it creates a rich thick lather with any type of soap and it really deep cleans, (Regular for most men, Gentle or Extra Gentle for most women).</li>
      <li>i feel so clean and don&#x27;t need to use any other product to feel like my face has been exfoliated and really clean.  </li>
      <li>This product is great for deep cleaning your face and lifting dead skin.  </li>
      <li>Need gentle type.</li>
      <li>Lots of \\&quot;wannabes\\&quot; but not the real thing.</li>
      <li>The local discount store started carrying a cheap version</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using for 40 years - highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I recommend it highly!  </li>
      <li>It really cleans out your pores.  </li>
      <li>Just go gentle on the face.  </li>
      <li>and her skin is feeling much</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a product to gently scrub your face with, I recommend Buf-Puf.</li>
      <li>My husband has very oily skin and battled blimishes all of his life.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never been a fan of the gentle ones and that seems to be what places like Wal-Mart and Rite-Aid always carry.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon...</li>
      <li>They are gently abrasive.  </li>
      <li>I used to use these things as a kid and they really work.</li>
      <li>I expected better price for buying six-pack box</li>
      <li>works well and exfoliation is very thorough.</li>
      <li>As a man i have really taut skin  </li>
      <li>I use them with a sugar scrub and it really makes a difference with my skin.  </li>
      <li>They are much easier to use and store than a loofah.  </li>
      <li>Buf-puf makes the whole face shine.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone that wants to make their skin feel and look re-vitalized.</li>
      <li>It really makes a difference when you begin to use Buf-Puf.</li>
      <li>I also find these very helpful with combating ingrown hairs.</li>
      <li>You can use any cleaner, it&#x27;s the exfoliating sponge that really does the trick.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Also use them on my arms and legs before the use of artificial tanning products to exfoliate my skin, they are awesome for that!  </li>
      <li>I purchased the &#x27;regular&#x27; pads which are far more abrasive than I used years ago.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product since I was about 13 years old (ahem, that&#x27;s 40 years, folks), and quite simply, nothing works better.</li>
      <li>I think this Buf-Puf is a little larger than what I remember buying at the drugstores but by all means does the same great job of scrubbing your fascial skin and feeling really clean and refresh.</li>
      <li>These are gentle enough for my sensitive skin but give me a fresh clean feeling</li>
      <li>I have two daughters and they absolutely love these facial sponges so much so that I tried one for the first time last week</li>
      <li>You can do this once or twice a week just as well if not better with this wonderful little puff.</li>
      <li>They hold up better than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried using.</li>
      <li>I clean all my facial and neck area with circular motion.</li>
      <li>But use a different one for each...Rinsed well with HOT water and soap and left to dry after each use, these work wonders for keeping my skin blemish free and smooth!</li>
      <li>If you haven&#x27;t used one of these before, start slowly and gently and work up to a more intensive scrub or you might look like you gave your face rug burn!</li>
      <li>The Gentle Buf-Puf is useless for acne, but may be suitable for more sensitive skin without acne.</li>
      <li>Not only did Buf-Puf accomplish that, but they have kept my skin looking young and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I love the regular Buf Puf and use it daily.  </li>
      <li>Same results the facial sponge is a little smaller as it should be  perfect size for the face.</li>
      <li>They are as high quality as I remember them.  </li>
      <li>I have found store brands that are not as high in quality as Buf Pufs</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this for women of all ages.</li>
      <li>I have been using Buf Puf since high school (I am in my 50&#x27;s now).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used these since I was in high school.</li>
      <li>I love these little face scrubbers.  </li>
      <li>Keep in mind that when you first use this sponge that it&#x27;ll be hard but after a while it&#x27;ll ease up and be a bit more softer.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately whilst the product is great the cost of shipping it to Australia is prohibitive - I would like to find a supplier who will post the item to me rather than having to use a shipping company.</li>
      <li>At this point his word was golden, however, my first experience was rough.</li>
      <li>Nice thick sponges.  </li>
      <li>It also stimulates your body to make new layers to replace those removed.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without them</li>
      <li>My skin is very clear.</li>
      <li>Too many other items are far too smooth to do the job and some others are so rough you&#x27;d think you were sanding the back deck!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Buf-Puf facial sponge for 20yrs now, since I was 15 to be exact</li>
      <li>The only thing that will get my face and neck clean is a regular Buff Puff pad and Clearasil face wash.  </li>
      <li>These make your skin so soft and clear!  </li>
      <li>The cheap rip-off version was flimsy and scratchy and went away to almost nothing quickly.  </li>
      <li>I live in a semi-rural area, and I don&#x27;t even bother checking the local shops any more - it&#x27;s a waste of time.</li>
      <li>The little scrubber works wonders on minimizing razor burn and ingrown hairs, as well as keeping my skin smooth and clear of blemishes.  </li>
      <li>My only gripe is that I got a nice and neat little package of what looked like 6 buf pufs, but upon opening the plastic holding the 6 boxes only 5 boxes contained a puf!!</li>
      <li>They are Too soft.  </li>
      <li>I am now 53 years old.  </li>
      <li>Completely affordable....</li>
      <li>Finally found the real thing again.</li>
      <li>Fast shipment of solid product.  </li>
      <li>Have used these for 15 years without complaint better than the competition.  </li>
      <li>but I do not recommend them for people with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>a busy gal with work....</li>
      <li>I sweat in my car when driving and at night when sleeping, so the deep exfoliation that this sponge provides is very needed.</li>
      <li>I have used these for at least 25 years and love them.  </li>
      <li>I have given up trying to find them in stores, and now I buy them directly from 3M or Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I used to suffer from breakouts even though I&#x27;m now 51 years old.  </li>
      <li>The quality far surpasses any of the look-alike sponges.  </li>
      <li>It lasts MUCH longer and stays white.  </li>
      <li>It lasts pretty long, but I change once a month for sanitary reasons.</li>
      <li>However, that is way too much to pay for only one sponge.</li>
      <li>FYI -- Gently use this sponge on your face area as you don&#x27;t want to have irritated and red skin after use.  </li>
      <li>We are in our early 50&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Have turned all my young family members on to this product.</li>
      <li>I should have gotten the sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think of doing that to begin with because my skin is not all that sensitive-</li>
      <li>They last very well</li>
      <li>I did stop using them for a few months at a time at various points, but found my skin was more blemish-prone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Cheaper pads are too scratchy and they break down quickly.  </li>
      <li>This is not available locally, but thanks to Amazon and adding it to another order it came fairly quickly.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve reached a solid middle age and have used Buf Pufs consistently since my 20&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend use morning and evening daily.</li>
      <li>Use a light touch or your skin will get red and sensitive after a few days.</li>
      <li>It will hurt at first, scrub harder.</li>
      <li>I wanted more of a tough scrubber then a soft sponge.</li>
      <li>Finding the multi-pack on Amazon was great since they have been hard to find in stores locally of late.  </li>
      <li>No imitation pufs for me.</li>
      <li>They quickly scrub away all dead skin</li>
      <li>Like everything, it wears out, but other than that, it does exactly as promised.  </li>
      <li>They were exactly what I expected!</li>
      <li>This sponge is soft enough to not irritate delicate skin but finely abrasive enough to slough off the old.</li>
      <li>Bronner&#x27;s and Buf Puf&amp;#34;, they start in on why that&#x27;s so bad for your skin, even though the question arose because my skin looks so great.  </li>
      <li>The key is to wash with it day and night to keep your face clear.</li>
      <li>The store brands don&#x27;t last as long as the real deal.</li>
      <li>Barely a wrinkle on my face.  </li>
      <li>Still as powerful in cleaning but not as harshly abrasive.  </li>
      <li>One word of caution though, if you are not accustomed to any exfolation you should start out using these very gently and only about every other day until you get used to them.  </li>
      <li>Can highly recommend using it once a day, every single day.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t rub too long or hard or you will over exfoliate (rub away too much of top layer of skin) and have red areas.  </li>
      <li>so if you scrub hard and like to be EXTREMELY clean then this is for you.</li>
      <li>For the first few uses, I suggest using a very light hand, as it can be a little harsh.</li>
      <li>The pink one is super-gentle and shreds on me but might be lovely for really delicate skin.  </li>
      <li>I buy these in bulk, my local stores do not carry the regular just the soft sponge.  </li>
      <li>There is a gentle version of this product, but I (and the other users I know) prefer the regular.</li>
      <li>love them and they are getting real hard to find at the local stores</li>
      <li>The imitation ones are limp and cheap, don&#x27;t last.</li>
      <li>Even though they&#x27;re harder to find at the stores these days, they&#x27;re worth hunting down.  </li>
      <li>They last a reasonable amount of scrubbings and leave you with much younger looking skin, that feels cleaner than using a conventional wash cloth.  </li>
      <li>My 11-year old daughter is starting to have breakouts but not sure if her skin will be able to handle it as the sponge can feel a little rough on people trying for the first few times.  </li>
      <li>I only wish that a five-cent piece of spun plastic didn&#x27;t sell for nearly $4, but no similar generic pad I&#x27;ve tried lasts nearly as long nor works as well.</li>

<li> It keeps my face glowing, free of unsightly roughness and bumps, and the texture looks and feels great.</li>

<li> These do the job effectively and can be used with any cleanser.  </li>
<li> My daughter&#x27;s nose and chin was getting kind of bumpy.  </li>
<li> Buf Puf is what has kept my skin looking so good for so many years.  </li>
<li> I liked the fact that it was a 6 pack.</li>

<li> Even my husband has his own pad.</li>
<li> These are the absolute best.</li>
<li> They are especially useful on the days I have used sunscreen to help remove the gunk.  </li>
<li> lasts a long time and this makes my wife happy, happy wife happy life</li>
<li> Been using these for years and they clean and exfoliate great.</li>
<li> but you better first try both varieties and decide which one is best for your skin.</li>
<li> I have used these before and like using them.&lt;br /&gt;Happy to be able to get hold of them again.&lt;br /&gt;Not popular in NZ</li>
<li> Great value -well worth the price</li>
<li> The size is a good fit for my hand</li>
<li> The ability to buy bulk ensures I always have my favorite face scrubbers handy.  </li>

<li> Just a super product, I would be more than happy to recommend product to anyone,</li>
<li> Love, love, love!  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ll have to read more to see if they&#x27;ll be suitable as I would think they&#x27;d help her a lot.  </li>
<li> There are MANY substitutes - but NOTHING is as good as the original Buf-Puf.</li>
<li> That&#x27;s fine with me!  </li>
<li> Love these, They exfoliate beautifully and not too much.</li>
<li> Just love how my skin feels after I use this sponge.</li>
<li> Love these.</li>
<li> This was a much better deal.</li>
<li> There are many imitators but none have lasted me longer than a week.  </li>
<li> I feel that Buf Puf scrubs away the dirt off my face more than just washing alone with my hands.  </li>
<li> but I&#x27;m actually quite impressed.</li>

<li> My skin looks better than either of my two sisters who have had work done.</li>
<li> He was able to tell me everything about the history of my face just by looking at it.</li>
<li> Used these for years ~ love that it cleans and exfoliates.</li>
<li> Glad i looked on Amazon.</li>
<li> It keeps his face clean and fairly acne free.  </li>
<li> When I first used this product I loved what it did for my face.  </li>
<li> I use it everyday with my own soap, and my skin feels great!</li>
<li> After using these, my forehead fine lines were more noticeable.</li>
<li> Very good facial sponge.</li>
<li> If you have gentler skin, I recommend the two more lady like Buf Puf models available.    </li>
<li> Works great - my skin has been clear since using these, even through hormonal acne.  </li>
<li> You used to be able to get cheap knockoffs that were almost identical, but I&#x27;ve found the quality of these has gone downhill, and you get a face sponge that shreds after about a week&#x27;s use.  </li>
<li> I was satisfied with this transaction and continue to purchase from this seller when available.</li>
<li> I now have a good supply and at a reasonable price.</li>
<li> Good product, fast delivery</li>
<li> It&#x27;s good to change them out (they do wear out), though depending on how much they are used--they can be used longer than directed on instructions.</li>
<li> Then daily is great and will yield wonderful benefits of fresh, soft skin.</li>
<li> Other than that this product is awesome</li>
<li> They are great for exfoliating and leave my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
<li> And the pack of 6 is really also the most cost effective idea.</li>
<li> Be sure to use them gently as they could irritate your skin if you were to enthusiastic .</li>
<li> If you want flawless soft skin I highly recommend these.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s fine.</li>
<li> One review said that it helped with fine lines and wrinkles...</li>
<li> so it&#x27;s fine.</li>
<li> and it is still fine.</li>
<li> course I am paying more for these sponges, but they do not soften as quickly as the bargain brands.</li>
<li> With Super Saver shipping, I can get just what I want, EZ!</li>
<li> Just use it with your favorite mild soap &amp; you are set!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Been using Buf-Puf since we got a free sample in the mail when I was 16 - over 30 years ago.</li>
<li> I was fortunate to find it on line.</li>
<li> the savings available through purchasing the multi-pack, I think I&#x27;m going to stick with the \\&quot;real\\&quot; Buf-Pufs from here on.</li>
<li> These are genuine buff puffs --- not knock offs.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s really fantastic for feet.  </li>
<li> My face feels smooth after using this.  </li>
<li> and I noticed my face didn&#x27;t feel as smooth while I was without a buf-puf.  </li>
<li> Used regularly it makes your skin look great</li>
<li> - my skin is so happy to have my Buf-Puf back.</li>
<li> My skin is so smooth now.</li>
<li> Great facial cleaner!</li>
<li> I couldn&#x27;t find these anywhere, fortunately Amazon had them.</li>
<li> so far so good.  </li>
<li> I have used these for many many years in conjuction with Purpose gentle cleansing bar.&lt;br</li>
<li> I really feel like my serums and moisturizers are able to penetrate after using the buff puff instead of sitting on top of my skin.</li>
<li> Buying these here seem like a good deal too because at the supermarket near my house, these cost about $5.00 each.</li>
<li> They are wonderful for cleaning off dead skin cells, leaving your face smooth and clean and refreshed for the day.  </li>
<li> Keeps skin smooth and fresh!</li>
<li> Your skin feel so clean and smooth after using one.</li>
<li> I was so excited to find these on Amazon because I can&#x27;t find them in stores.</li>
<li> You have to have the original.</li>
<li> I bought the original BUF puf because I know my skin can handle some roughness</li>
<li> Just feel grungy and not quite clean without my Buf Puf.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used Buf-Pufs to clean my face for years.  </li>
<li> They make my face feel so clean.  </li>
<li> They gently clean your face day after day.  </li>
<li> This product exfoliates my skin and always leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
<li> so i use the sponge to help clean off excess skin cells and oil before shaving.</li>
<li> you&#x27;re face feeling renewed and clean</li>
<li> Super smooth.</li>
<li> My face never felt so clean.</li>
<li> I use it before shaving, to help clean and soften my beard.</li>
<li> These are by far the best quality facial sponges I have ever used.</li>
<li> Good mechanical way to slough off old skin and keep face looking fresh.</li>
<li> My skin is more vibrant and softer since I&#x27;ve been using it!</li>
<li> So if you want nice soft feet with baby-clean heels, I recommend this.</li>
<li> This 6-pack was a good deal and will last us about a year.</li>
<li> Glad to have the real thing.</li>
<li> The texture does not feel good to the face, but it is so abrasive that it actually works.</li>
<li> Do go easy the first time using them.  </li>
<li> For some reason they are really, really hard to find in stores, so it is great to be able to order them online in bulk.</li>
<li> I like to use it before going to bed, with a mild soap.</li>
<li> They seem to hold up much better, and the firmness and density are better - they spring back after using and rinsing well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Nothing works as well as these pads with a mild soap.</li>
<li> These are the best daily facial sponges.</li>
<li> Love how soft my skin feels after using!!</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t beat the super cheap &amp; fast shipping with Prime!</li>
<li> These facial sponges are great for a mild exfoliation that I truly think keeps my skin looking younger and better.  </li>
<li> It comes in regular and gentle sponges for the face and they also have a sponge for the body which is especially good for elbows and heels and also makes your skin feel really soft after use.  </li>
<li> Overall I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this product.</li>
<li> cant live without, better than the sonic brushes, at exfoliation.</li>
<li> Real Buf Puf lasts a minimum of a month, easily.</li>
<li> Stick with the real thing!!</li>
<li> So grateful to be able to not only buy it online, but to be able to buy a multi-pak at a much cheaper price!</li>
<li> I love these easy on your skin, but deep cleaning.</li>
<li> is very smooth and clear.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s an absolutely fantastic product - so much so that I bought a year&#x27;s supply.</li>
<li> These are so much finer than the cheap drugstore version-</li>
<li> After he could pinpoint the different ages and areas where I had experienced acne, and told me all the pros and cons of the different medications available, he recommended the Buf-Puf.</li>
<li> It helps keep my skin fresh feeling.  </li>
<li> I own a back brush that has a surface that these attach to.</li>
<li> Some people with more sensitive skin might prefer the gentle version, but I&#x27;ve always gotten good results with the standard.</li>
<li> Leaves my skin looking fresh.</li>
<li> I recommend these for any one at any age as you can use your own personal cleanser with these.</li>
<li> I finally thought to check Amazon for a bulk buy and have been very happy with the price, but happier that I&#x27;m back to the real deal.  </li>
<li> I begin my facial with a nice cleaning and then move onto the moisturizer.  </li>
<li> These are not too rough for gentle skin and do a great job of exfoliating.  </li>
<li> It gets rid of blemishes fairly quickly as well if I&#x27;m consistent with it.</li>
<li> I suggest a mild cleanser since the pufs can be pretty rigorous (like, don&#x27;t use these with a scrub).</li>
<li> It helps keeps my skin clean, clear and smooth feeling.</li>
<li> I have used a Buf-Puf for almost 30 years and they are superior to other sponges out there.</li>
<li> I was so glad to find them here.the new styled  sponge&#x27;s are no where near as  good and lasting.</li>
<li> The price was right and it&#x27;s a product she loves.</li>
<li> REALLY squeaky clean.</li>
<li> These really make my face feel clean.  </li>
<li> No other skin-cleaning sponge is better than Buf-Puf for treatment and prevention of acne.  </li>
<li> Just a quick wash with your favorite cleanser once a daily.</li>
<li> I went for years not being able to find them in stores (because they don&#x27;t sell them in stores anymore, apparently).</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a 57 year old male and a friend of mine who is a skin specialist marvels at how good my skin looks and feels.</li>
<li> Excellent for everyday facial exfoliating.</li>
<li> /&gt;I use the buff puff with a good facial cleaner in the shower and wow -</li>
<li> This is an inexpensive way to exfoliate and does a great job so save your money on more expensive options.</li>
<li> I keep one of these handy, and also the small disposable to keep my skin fresh and blackhead free.  </li>
<li> Very gentle</li>
<li> If my skin is sensitive, I may use it every other day, but these work great.</li>
<li> A little soap or shampoo on your pad and your good to go.  </li>
<li> Afterwards, your face will feel fresh, soft, and clean.</li>
<li> After a month of use my first one is still holding up quite well and does a good job on my face with a little bit of soap.</li>
<li> They are more gentle than the hard sponges and are just as effective.</li>
<li> and this is a fast, convenient and economical way to purchase them.</li>
<li> Much exfoliating!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this Buf Puf for 30 years and it&#x27;s never failed me.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve always liked them and have tried off-brands; none work as well of hold up as long as the &#x27;real deal&#x27;.  </li>
<li> Worked exactly as advertised.</li>
<li> exactly what I wanted.</li>
<li> I have been using this product for years and my face is smooth and soft.      </li>
<li> It helps to exfoliate and make your skin soft and smooth.</li>
<li> Finally, real Buf-Puf&#x27;s!</li>
<li> I scrub my feet vigorously with it almost every day and it keeps them smooth, soft, and super-clean.  </li>
<li> I just find that I get more use out of the individual sponges than I do with this one.</li>
<li> I feel I get more for the money with the individual sponges.</li>
<li> I use them in the morning and the evening with my favorite facial soaps.</li>
<li> Thanks!</li>
<li> I have used them for many years and they help keep your skin looking younger.</li>
<li> Keeps skin smooth and young looking.</li>
<li> I have been using Buf-Puf facial sponges and body sponges for years and love them.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m so glad I finally bought</li>
<li> Our granddaughter was able to get rid of her acne in a short time by using them</li>
<li> they usually have the cheap kind</li>
<li> My Friends and family always notice when I use my Buff Puff, my skin really glows!</li>
<li> back, I have found nothing better.  </li>
<li> Use them all the time consistently.  </li>
<li> I have very senstive skin, but these work well!  </li>
<li> These look like they will hold up pretty well.</li>
<li> I think this gets the dead skin off as good as any product</li>
<li> I love buff puff pads because they are the only thing that keeps my skin clean and clear of blackheads.  </li>
<li> I have been using the Buf-Puf for over 30 years and attribute a far smoother, nearly wrinkle free complexion than most of my (mature) friends.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed the gentle exfoliation and deep cleansing of these pads on a daily basis for many years.  </li>
<li> Good value, right texture, and long lasting quality.</li>
<li> (gentle is very gentle)</li>
<li> OK, Now I&#x27;m starting to sound like a commercial.</li>
<li> Fast shipping and the product was exactly as described.</li>
<li> The first time I ever used the Buf-Puf, it was recommended to me by a very &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; dermataologist.</li>
<li> Usual good Amazon service, delivery in 7 or 8 days.</li>
<li> Love these facial sponges on the with the Avon Clearskin Professional Deep Pore Cleansing Scrub or your favorite cleanser.</li>
<li> It allows me to sleep with a fresh new skin layer.</li>
<li> I have used Buff Puffs for over 10 years and have a very clear fresh complexion.</li>
<li> and 40&#x27;s was certainly exacerbated if not caused by the Buf Puf.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t live without them!!  </li>
<li> Remove the outer layer(s) of dead dry skin and you reveal fresher skin that can absorb moisturizer more effectively.</li>
<li> The Buf-Puf Reusable Facial Sponge is the best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used, it creates a rich thick lather with any type of soap and it really deep cleans, (Regular for most men, Gentle or Extra Gentle for most women).</li>
<li> i feel so clean and don&#x27;t need to use any other product to feel like my face has been exfoliated and really clean.  </li>
<li> This product is great for deep cleaning your face and lifting dead skin.  </li>
<li> Need gentle type.</li>
<li> Lots of \\&quot;wannabes\\&quot; but not the real thing.</li>
<li> The local discount store started carrying a cheap version</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using for 40 years - highly recommend!</li>
<li> I recommend it highly!  </li>
<li> It really cleans out your pores.  </li>
<li> Just go gentle on the face.  </li>
<li> and her skin is feeling much</li>
<li> If you are looking for a product to gently scrub your face with, I recommend Buf-Puf.</li>
<li> My husband has very oily skin and battled blimishes all of his life.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never been a fan of the gentle ones and that seems to be what places like Wal-Mart and Rite-Aid always carry.  </li>
<li> Thanks Amazon...</li>
<li> They are gently abrasive.  </li>
<li> I used to use these things as a kid and they really work.</li>
<li> I expected better price for buying six-pack box</li>
<li> works well and exfoliation is very thorough.</li>
<li> As a man i have really taut skin  </li>
<li> I use them with a sugar scrub and it really makes a difference with my skin.  </li>
<li> They are much easier to use and store than a loofah.  </li>
<li> Buf-puf makes the whole face shine.</li>
<li> I would recommend this product to anyone that wants to make their skin feel and look re-vitalized.</li>
<li> It really makes a difference when you begin to use Buf-Puf.</li>
<li> I also find these very helpful with combating ingrown hairs.</li>
<li> You can use any cleaner, it&#x27;s the exfoliating sponge that really does the trick.</li>
<li> Thanks</li>
<li> Also use them on my arms and legs before the use of artificial tanning products to exfoliate my skin, they are awesome for that!  </li>
<li> I purchased the &#x27;regular&#x27; pads which are far more abrasive than I used years ago.  </li>
<li> I have been using this product since I was about 13 years old (ahem, that&#x27;s 40 years, folks), and quite simply, nothing works better.</li>
<li> I think this Buf-Puf is a little larger than what I remember buying at the drugstores but by all means does the same great job of scrubbing your fascial skin and feeling really clean and refresh.</li>
<li> These are gentle enough for my sensitive skin but give me a fresh clean feeling</li>
<li> I have two daughters and they absolutely love these facial sponges so much so that I tried one for the first time last week</li>
<li> You can do this once or twice a week just as well if not better with this wonderful little puff.</li>
<li> They hold up better than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried using.</li>
<li> I clean all my facial and neck area with circular motion.</li>
<li> But use a different one for each...Rinsed well with HOT water and soap and left to dry after each use, these work wonders for keeping my skin blemish free and smooth!</li>
<li> If you haven&#x27;t used one of these before, start slowly and gently and work up to a more intensive scrub or you might look like you gave your face rug burn!</li>
<li> The Gentle Buf-Puf is useless for acne, but may be suitable for more sensitive skin without acne.</li>
<li> Not only did Buf-Puf accomplish that, but they have kept my skin looking young and smooth.  </li>
<li> I love the regular Buf Puf and use it daily.  </li>
<li> Same results the facial sponge is a little smaller as it should be  perfect size for the face.</li>
<li> They are as high quality as I remember them.  </li>
<li> I have found store brands that are not as high in quality as Buf Pufs</li>
<li> I highly recommend them</li>
<li> I highly recommend them.</li>
<li> Highly recommend this for women of all ages.</li>
<li> I have been using Buf Puf since high school (I am in my 50&#x27;s now).</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used these since I was in high school.</li>
<li> I love these little face scrubbers.  </li>
<li> Keep in mind that when you first use this sponge that it&#x27;ll be hard but after a while it&#x27;ll ease up and be a bit more softer.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately whilst the product is great the cost of shipping it to Australia is prohibitive - I would like to find a supplier who will post the item to me rather than having to use a shipping company.</li>
<li> At this point his word was golden, however, my first experience was rough.</li>
<li> Nice thick sponges.  </li>
<li> It also stimulates your body to make new layers to replace those removed.  </li>
<li> Can&#x27;t live without them</li>
<li> My skin is very clear.</li>
<li> Too many other items are far too smooth to do the job and some others are so rough you&#x27;d think you were sanding the back deck!  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using the Buf-Puf facial sponge for 20yrs now, since I was 15 to be exact</li>
<li> The only thing that will get my face and neck clean is a regular Buff Puff pad and Clearasil face wash.  </li>
<li> These make your skin so soft and clear!  </li>
<li> The cheap rip-off version was flimsy and scratchy and went away to almost nothing quickly.  </li>
<li> I live in a semi-rural area, and I don&#x27;t even bother checking the local shops any more - it&#x27;s a waste of time.</li>
<li> The little scrubber works wonders on minimizing razor burn and ingrown hairs, as well as keeping my skin smooth and clear of blemishes.  </li>
<li> My only gripe is that I got a nice and neat little package of what looked like 6 buf pufs, but upon opening the plastic holding the 6 boxes only 5 boxes contained a puf!!</li>
<li> They are Too soft.  </li>
<li> I am now 53 years old.  </li>
<li> Completely affordable....</li>
<li> Finally found the real thing again.</li>
<li> Fast shipment of solid product.  </li>
<li> Have used these for 15 years without complaint better than the competition.  </li>
<li> but I do not recommend them for people with sensitive skin.</li>
<li> a busy gal with work....</li>
<li> I sweat in my car when driving and at night when sleeping, so the deep exfoliation that this sponge provides is very needed.</li>
<li> I have used these for at least 25 years and love them.  </li>
<li> I have given up trying to find them in stores, and now I buy them directly from 3M or Amazon.  </li>
<li> I used to suffer from breakouts even though I&#x27;m now 51 years old.  </li>
<li> The quality far surpasses any of the look-alike sponges.  </li>
<li> It lasts MUCH longer and stays white.  </li>
<li> It lasts pretty long, but I change once a month for sanitary reasons.</li>
<li> However, that is way too much to pay for only one sponge.</li>
<li> FYI -- Gently use this sponge on your face area as you don&#x27;t want to have irritated and red skin after use.  </li>
<li> We are in our early 50&#x27;s.</li>
<li> Have turned all my young family members on to this product.</li>
<li> I should have gotten the sensitive skin.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t think of doing that to begin with because my skin is not all that sensitive-</li>
<li> They last very well</li>
<li> I did stop using them for a few months at a time at various points, but found my skin was more blemish-prone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Cheaper pads are too scratchy and they break down quickly.  </li>
<li> This is not available locally, but thanks to Amazon and adding it to another order it came fairly quickly.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve reached a solid middle age and have used Buf Pufs consistently since my 20&#x27;s.  </li>
<li> I highly recommend use morning and evening daily.</li>
<li> Use a light touch or your skin will get red and sensitive after a few days.</li>
<li> It will hurt at first, scrub harder.</li>
<li> I wanted more of a tough scrubber then a soft sponge.</li>
<li> Finding the multi-pack on Amazon was great since they have been hard to find in stores locally of late.  </li>
<li> No imitation pufs for me.</li>
<li> They quickly scrub away all dead skin</li>
<li> Like everything, it wears out, but other than that, it does exactly as promised.  </li>
<li> They were exactly what I expected!</li>
<li> This sponge is soft enough to not irritate delicate skin but finely abrasive enough to slough off the old.</li>
<li> Bronner&#x27;s and Buf Puf&amp;#34;, they start in on why that&#x27;s so bad for your skin, even though the question arose because my skin looks so great.  </li>
<li> The key is to wash with it day and night to keep your face clear.</li>
<li> The store brands don&#x27;t last as long as the real deal.</li>
<li> Barely a wrinkle on my face.  </li>
<li> Still as powerful in cleaning but not as harshly abrasive.  </li>
<li> One word of caution though, if you are not accustomed to any exfolation you should start out using these very gently and only about every other day until you get used to them.  </li>
<li> Can highly recommend using it once a day, every single day.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t rub too long or hard or you will over exfoliate (rub away too much of top layer of skin) and have red areas.  </li>
<li> so if you scrub hard and like to be EXTREMELY clean then this is for you.</li>
<li> For the first few uses, I suggest using a very light hand, as it can be a little harsh.</li>
<li> The pink one is super-gentle and shreds on me but might be lovely for really delicate skin.  </li>
<li> I buy these in bulk, my local stores do not carry the regular just the soft sponge.  </li>
<li> There is a gentle version of this product, but I (and the other users I know) prefer the regular.</li>
<li> love them and they are getting real hard to find at the local stores</li>
<li> The imitation ones are limp and cheap, don&#x27;t last.</li>
<li> Even though they&#x27;re harder to find at the stores these days, they&#x27;re worth hunting down.  </li>
<li> They last a reasonable amount of scrubbings and leave you with much younger looking skin, that feels cleaner than using a conventional wash cloth.  </li>
<li> My 11-year old daughter is starting to have breakouts but not sure if her skin will be able to handle it as the sponge can feel a little rough on people trying for the first few times.  </li>
<li> I only wish that a five-cent piece of spun plastic didn&#x27;t sell for nearly $4, but no similar generic pad I&#x27;ve tried lasts nearly as long nor works as well.</li>
<li> be gentle or you will scrub your skin raw.......</li>
<li> can never go wrong with the original Buf Puf!</li>
<li> People with sensitive skin may want to choose a different facial sponge that is less abrasive.  </li>
<li> This is the second time I ordered 12 &amp; they last me a long time.  </li>
<li> This multi-pack will last me a long time, even though I use it every day.</li>
<li> and they last a long time.</li>
<li> They just don&#x27;t last as long or work as well.  </li>
<li> Wish they were cheaper, but they do last a long time.</li>
<li> I once had a serious acne problem....and this product helped get that deep down clean I needed to get rid of the acne which was caused by oils.</li>
<li> Hubby and I have both used Buff Puffs since high school (just attended his 25th reunion, ugh!), but the regular ones are hard to find.</li>
<li> and they last a long time!</li>
<li> Just like we used years ago when we were kids.&lt;br /&gt;Great for exfoliating and keeping pores clear and black head</li>
<li> When allowed to dry properly, they do not get smelly like a wash cloth does.  </li>
<li> The only reason I gave this product 4 instead of 5 stars is because it is far too harsh for my skin-</li>
<li> Just remember to  rinse it and put it on a dry place every time you use it and it will last quite long.</li>
<li> fine but too expensive found some at 2.50</li>
<li> Daily exfoliation is the key to maximizing effectiveness of other products.  </li>
<li> When my local drug store runs out, I try generic products or other sponges.  </li>
<li> I have difficulty finding Buf-Puf products in local drugstores and other brands of facial sponges do not measure up.</li>
<li> I have tried other methods, even dermodegradation, which is very tough, but this sponge is just magical...</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried generic face pads ,but they are too soft and won&#x27;t scrub hard enough.  </li>
<li> and I won&#x27;t run out for a long time since each lasts a long time in my shower.  </li>
<li> When you get a facial that usually costs upwards of $75.00 the first thing done to your face is exfoliating the dead cells.</li>
<li> And I am not young by any means.  </li>
<li> It keeps the dead skin cells from clogging my pores, which helps prevent old looking skin.</li>
<li> All the other facial sponges last less than a month when used daily</li>
<li> have no idea why someone would spend big bucks for Clarisonic and other fancy battery</li>
<li> They rinse and air dry</li>
<li> (I stand mine up on it&#x27;s edge on a soap dish tray to dry.)  </li>
<li> Dry skin.  </li>
<li> I ordered both the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; and the \\&quot;Extra Gentle\\&quot; Buf-Puf, in case the regular one was too harsh on my skin these days.</li>
<li> These are hard to find where I live.</li>
<li> It truly cleans your skin, deep down into your skin.</li>
<li> operated face brushes when a Buf-Puf does the same job with less hassle.</li>
<li> I started using this because I had dry skin and rough patches on my face.</li>
<li> So I guess I paid the amount for 6 and an empty box?</li>
<li> Reg. are rough on the face.</li>
<li> It si one of the few products that does what it says when it comes to simple skin care.  </li>
<li> I spent over 27 years in the military and it kept me from getting razor bumps on my face.  </li>
<li> If you are trying to get rid of dead epidermal layers on your face or even on your legs or arms, as happens especially during the summer, Buf-Puf is the pad to do it.  </li>
<li> This product is getting harder and harder to find in the stores.</li>
<li> No miracle cream will work any such wonder if it can&#x27;t penetrate that layer of dead cells.  </li>
<li> been using these for 40yrs and Amazon is one of the few places that sell the Regular.  </li>
<li> Everything left my face feeling ruff and uneven.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve always had rough skin and this product always clears the skin.</li>
<li> (it lasts longer if you prevent it from getting wet).</li>
<li> You don&#x27;t need to exfoliate every day, max you&#x27;d want to use this is every other day.  </li>
<li> I have used it on other parts of my body as well</li>
<li> I used the almost identical sponges from other manufactures</li>
<li> It&#x27;s tough without being too rough, and my skin is always so soft.  </li>
<li> They are very rough but that is what I need around the nose forehead and for ingrown hairs.</li>
<li> Lately they have been hard to find at the exchange, so I have been ordering from Amazon at a reasonable price.</li>
<li> I am not as crazy about this particular sponge as I am about the Buf-Puf individual sponges, but it gets the job done.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using these, and the knock-offs, since the late &#x27;80s, and my face just doesn&#x27;t feel squeaky-clean enough without using a buff-pad of some sort.</li>
<li> They are definitely not worth it.  </li>
<li> I then give my feet a thick coat of a heavy cream or Vaseline, then put on a pair of white cotton socks and wear to bed.  </li>
<li> I also have to add that I get less pimples than I did before</li>
<li> my pores aren&#x27;t quite as black.</li>
<li> I tried a less $$ brand and No comparison.  </li>
<li> Recommended for black men to use before shaving to reduce razor bumps.</li>
<li> The local CVS makes a knock-off that&#x27;s not nearly as good.</li>
<li> but, unfortunately, I can&#x27;t find them where I live.</li>
<li> I have 5 of them left if anyone wants them.  : (</li>
<li> I started using these little scrubbers some 20 years ago.  </li>
<li> Little to harsh on the skin.</li>
<li> a few years ago I couldn&#x27;t find them.  </li>
<li> Lasts forever, holds its shape well, unlike cheaper ones that fall apart after a few uses.</li>
<li> It just doesn&#x27;t seem sanitary to use after a few uses</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this face sponge for a few months and I find I have fewer to no pimples.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used these sponges for years and was having trouble finding them in the drugstore.</li>
<li> It exfoliates without being harsh.</li>
<li> so it helps get rid of dead skin cells that pile up.</li>
<li> It took just a few days to get used to it, but i have been hooked on it now for years.  </li>
<li> No need to use everyday but can.</li>
<li> Still have a few of these in my stash over a year after this purchase.  </li>
<li> I use it everyday on my face in the shower.  </li>
<li> It feels slightly harsh but I like that</li>
<li> and I didn&#x27;t think they were harsh.</li>
<li> Lately they have been harder to find.  </li>
<li> I use them with my zinc soap to help tame the seborrheic dermatitis.  </li>
<li> Cheaper to use this with your favorite face soap than using a bunch of expensive products!!!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is Amazon or 3M fault.</li>
<li> I still remember the small store pharmacy clerk who told me about them when I was in my 20&#x27;s.  </li>
<li> but there is something viscerally satisfying about abrading your face with this terrifying exfoliator.</li>
<li> In the past I used them every day when I washed my face.  </li>
<li> and I usually use one pad for about 6 months</li>
<li> This item is near to impossible to find in my area..</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a type of person who scrubs hard</li>
<li> Why is this item so hard to find?</li>
<li> Hard to find in store as they have store brands that suck when compared.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t srcub hard or you will irritate your skin.</li>
<li> I had a hard time finding them, so I bought an imposter - it just fell apart</li>
<li> Buf Puf&#x27;s are hard to find these days in stores and I&#x27;m concerned 3M will discontinue them.  </li>
<li> You can hardly find them in the stores anymore</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t realize how hard this product would be before I purchased.  </li>
<li> Grew up with them and have a hard time finding them in stores.</li>
<li> I have used these for years, but lately they are hard to find.</li>
<li> (at least $60-100 per session).  </li>
<li> Also, I just like the fact that these sponges are not as expensive as other skin cleaning methods.</li>
<li> I had used it in previous years but had been unable to locate it anywhere here in Perth, WA.   </li>
<li> Unfortunately I&#x27;m convinced the harsh exfoliation causes skin to rebel and break out.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on fancy exfoliators and expensive whirling electronic face brushes.</li>
<li> It is never to late to start exfoliating!</li>
<li> This product is very hard to find in stores.  </li>
<li> Very hard to find in the stores anymore.</li>
<li> This brand is very hard to find in my area...</li>
<li> I was skeptical</li>
<li> The others are useless.</li>
<li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.  </li>
<li> I often get microdermabrasion treatments which can be expensive</li>
<li> They are expensive and you have to buy a box of six, but</li>
<li> These sponges are not for the faint at heart.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s always depressing buying Buf-Pufs because they&#x27;re just so darned expensive.  </li>
<li> and I was afraid that Buff Puff went out of business,but I looked them up on Amazon.com</li>
<li> My Wife thinks I crazy ,but I say I&#x27;m just thinking ahead.  </li>
<li> Buf puffs are difficult to find!</li>
<li> I have had to use store brand imitations for a number of years however because they are so impossible to find.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and have never been disappointed in its performance.  </li>
<li> I have tried store brands that fall apart after a use or two :{ These are all I use now.</li>
<li> I hate trying to find these at the grocery store.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the best skin cleaning method I ever known. I have tried other methods, even dermodegradation, which is very tough, but this sponge is just magical... I like to use it before going to bed, with a mild soap. I clean all my facial and neck area with circular motion. It allows me to sleep with a fresh new skin layer. This sponge helps me remove the upper skin cells, which got damaged during the day. Just love how my skin feels after I use this sponge. Also, I just like the fact that these sponges are not as expensive as other skin cleaning methods.</li>
    <li> So glad I can find these on Amazon! Been using Buf-Puf since we got a free sample in the mail when I was 16 - over 30 years ago. Keeps skin smooth and fresh!</li>
    <li> They are Too soft.  They wear out after a couple of usages.  I use them on my face.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Love these. Haven&#x27;t used a cloth on my face in years.</li>
    <li> I have used these before and like using them.&lt;br /&gt;Happy to be able to get hold of them again.&lt;br /&gt;Not popular in NZ</li>
    <li> Was marketed as a facial sponge and pictured as such. When I received the item it was a body sponge. To coarse to use on the face. The package received even read body sponge not facial sponge as advertised.</li>
    <li> Have used these for 40 years with Neutrogena soap.  My skin is very clear.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Buf Puf products since my teens.  I am now 53 years old.  It helps keep my skin fresh feeling.  I can&#x27;t find them in the local stores anymore and this is a fast, convenient and economical way to purchase them.</li>
    <li> I own a back brush that has a surface that these attach to. Much exfoliating! I couldn&#x27;t find them in the store anymore as a multi pack. This was a much better deal.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for over twenty years.  My initial use was to help prevent break outs.  Not only did Buf-Puf accomplish that, but they have kept my skin looking young and smooth.  For a woman in her 50&#x27;s, that is a wonderful thing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this Buf Puf for 30 years and it&#x27;s never failed me. There are many imitators but none have lasted me longer than a week.  Real Buf Puf lasts a minimum of a month, easily. I&#x27;m a man and the stronger scrubbing area works best for me.    If you have gentler skin, I recommend the two more lady like Buf Puf models available.    Either way, these babes LAST and there is a model for each skin type.</li>
    <li> I have oily and sometimes flaky skin (when I don&#x27;t wash my face for a day).  I feel that Buf Puf scrubs away the dirt off my face more than just washing alone with my hands.  Keep in mind that when you first use this sponge that it&#x27;ll be hard but after a while it&#x27;ll ease up and be a bit more softer.  I&#x27;m a type of person who scrubs hard so if you scrub hard and like to be EXTREMELY clean then this is for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using BufPufs and Neutrogena soap to wash my face for over 25 years and have never, ever had a skin problem.  Even though they&#x27;re harder to find at the stores these days, they&#x27;re worth hunting down.  Some people with more sensitive skin might prefer the gentle version, but I&#x27;ve always gotten good results with the standard.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! I have been using it for YEARS!!! It truly cleans your skin, deep down into your skin. Afterwards, your face will feel fresh, soft, and clean. I once had a serious acne problem....and this product helped get that deep down clean I needed to get rid of the acne which was caused by oils. The best part of this product...Completely affordable....OK, Now I&#x27;m starting to sound like a commercial. So in closing, just give it a try and see what a diffence it can make for you.</li>
    <li> I have been using buf-pufs for about 30 years nd I can&#x27;t stand it without them. For instance, when I&#x27;ve been in the hospital (3 times) I have had to get or replace them. Just feel grungy and not quite clean without my Buf Puf.</li>
    <li> I have used Buff Puffs for over 10 years and have a very clear fresh complexion. I highly recommend use morning and evening daily.</li>
    <li> I love my Buf-Puf!!! I like them better than the expensive electric brush I had. My skin is more vibrant and softer since I&#x27;ve been using it!</li>
    <li> These are one of my favorite shower items! I am so happy to have found them on Amazon, as I can no longer find them in stores. My only gripe is that I got a nice and neat little package of what looked like 6 buf pufs, but upon opening the plastic holding the 6 boxes only 5 boxes contained a puf!! So I guess I paid the amount for 6 and an empty box? I&#x27;m not sure if this is Amazon or 3M fault.</li>
    <li> Need gentle type. Reg. are rough on the face.</li>
    <li> Finally found the real thing again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years when all of a sudden it disappears from the shelves almost everywhere I shopped.  I was fortunate to find it on line. It si one of the few products that does what it says when it comes to simple skin care.  I spent over 27 years in the military and it kept me from getting razor bumps on my face.  Additionally, now I use it to keep my head as smoothe as my face.  If you keep selling I&#x27;ll keep buying it.  For someone like me the Buf-Puf is a necessity.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and have never been disappointed in its performance.  Like everything, it wears out, but other than that, it does exactly as promised.  Too many other items are far too smooth to do the job and some others are so rough you&#x27;d think you were sanding the back deck!  Buf-Puf is engineered to be what it is and do what it does as it&#x27;s supposed to do it.  If you are trying to get rid of dead epidermal layers on your face or even on your legs or arms, as happens especially during the summer, Buf-Puf is the pad to do it.  A little soap or shampoo on your pad and your good to go.  I recommend it with no hesitation nor exceptions.  Try it...you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> Have been using these for 30+ years!&lt;br /&gt;Excellent for exfoliation on my face and body...But use a different one for each...Rinsed well with HOT water and soap and left to dry after each use, these work wonders for keeping my skin blemish free and smooth!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but I&#x27;m actually quite impressed. After a month of use my first one is still holding up quite well and does a good job on my face with a little bit of soap.</li>
    <li> This product is getting harder and harder to find in the stores. Lots of \\&quot;wannabes\\&quot; but not the real thing. Stick with the real thing!! The others are useless.</li>
    <li> Love the buff puff for cleaning and exfoliating my face.👍👍.  😋</li>
    <li> Buf-Puf&#x27;s are THE BEST!!  All the other facial sponges last less than a month when used daily but Buf-Puf&#x27;s are effective for 7 to 8 months!!!  I&#x27;ve been a Buf-Puffer for 30 yrs and use nothing else.</li>
    <li> I ordered both the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; and the \\&quot;Extra Gentle\\&quot; Buf-Puf, in case the regular one was too harsh on my skin these days. For me, the regular one is preferable to the extra gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, having used look-alike products for several years now to save on costs, AND because I just couldn&#x27;t find the Buf-Puf brand anymore, I must say that the name brand ones ARE nicer. They seem to hold up much better, and the firmness and density are better - they spring back after using and rinsing well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the savings available through purchasing the multi-pack, I think I&#x27;m going to stick with the \\&quot;real\\&quot; Buf-Pufs from here on. I&#x27;ve been using these, and the knock-offs, since the late &#x27;80s, and my face just doesn&#x27;t feel squeaky-clean enough without using a buff-pad of some sort. I did stop using them for a few months at a time at various points, but found my skin was more blemish-prone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Amazon!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to find these on Amazon because I can&#x27;t find them in stores. I have used a Buf-Puf for almost 30 years and they are superior to other sponges out there.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Buf-Puf facial sponge since the 1980&#x27;s. The teardrop shape is ideal for lightly exfoliating around the eyelids/nose area. The narrow end is much easier to manipulate than the [[ASIN:B001EJOPTS Buf-Puf Double-Sided Body Sponge]], which, of course, is a great BODY SPONGE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SEE MY PHOTOS IN CUSTOMER IMAGES&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course I am paying more for these sponges, but they do not soften as quickly as the bargain brands.</li>
    <li> These are genuine buff puffs --- not knock offs.  I&#x27;ve always liked them and have tried off-brands; none work as well of hold up as long as the &#x27;real deal&#x27;.  This package is a very good value and I won&#x27;t run out for a long time since each lasts a long time in my shower.  Good value, right texture, and long lasting quality.</li>
    <li> I had used Buf-Puf products for over 20 years and always found them perfect for the task of cleaning and exfoliating then a few years ago I couldn&#x27;t find them.  The local discount store started carrying a cheap version so I gave it a try.  This is one of those situations where I got what I paid for.  The cheap rip-off version was flimsy and scratchy and went away to almost nothing quickly.  I was very happy to find the original Buf-Puf online.  They are as high quality as I remember them.  I use it everyday with my own soap, and my skin feels great!</li>
    <li> Why is this item so hard to find? Its the best facial sponge I&#x27;ve ever used. Lasts forever, holds its shape well, unlike cheaper ones that fall apart after a few uses. This multi-pack will last me a long time, even though I use it every day. I also keep one in my travel accessory bag. I do not like those phoofy balls on a string. I like the scruffier feel of Buf-Pufs for heels, elbows &amp; knees, especially.</li>
    <li> Would not go a day without!  Love, love, love!  I&#x27;ve been using for 40 years - highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love Buf Pufs and have used them for years but, unfortunately, I can&#x27;t find them where I live. I have found store brands that are not as high in quality as Buf Pufs so I will continue to buy these online.</li>
    <li> I found this product on Amazon.com - I had used it in previous years but had been unable to locate it anywhere here in Perth, WA.   It&#x27;s an absolutely fantastic product - so much so that I bought a year&#x27;s supply. Unfortunately whilst the product is great the cost of shipping it to Australia is prohibitive - I would like to find a supplier who will post the item to me rather than having to use a shipping company.</li>
    <li> I have been using these since I was a teenager. If you want flawless soft skin I highly recommend these. It&#x27;s double sided so you have a choice of how you want to cleanse your skin. I never shower without my Buf Pufs, My husband uses it too!</li>
    <li> These facial sponges are great for a mild exfoliation that I truly think keeps my skin looking younger and better.  Finding the multi-pack on Amazon was great since they have been hard to find in stores locally of late.  Love the shipping . . . love the product.  Try these if you want to look your best.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.  One word of caution though, if you are not accustomed to any exfolation you should start out using these very gently and only about every other day until you get used to them.  Then daily is great and will yield wonderful benefits of fresh, soft skin.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment of solid product.  Worked exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> Perfect-  exactly what I wanted. These are hard to find where I live. Great value -well worth the price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Buf-Pufs to clean my face for years.  The little scrubber works wonders on minimizing razor burn and ingrown hairs, as well as keeping my skin smooth and clear of blemishes.  I only wish that a five-cent piece of spun plastic didn&#x27;t sell for nearly $4, but no similar generic pad I&#x27;ve tried lasts nearly as long nor works as well.</li>
    <li> I love buff puff pads because they are the only thing that keeps my skin clean and clear of blackheads.  I&#x27;m a mobile mechanic working in the field a lot and get covered in grease oil and dirt all the time.  The only thing that will get my face and neck clean is a regular Buff Puff pad and Clearasil face wash.  I&#x27;ve tried generic face pads ,but they are too soft and won&#x27;t scrub hard enough.  My local stores don&#x27;t carry the Buff Puff pads anymore and I was afraid that Buff Puff went out of business,but I looked them up on Amazon.com and there they were ,so I bought six of them.  My Wife thinks I crazy ,but I say I&#x27;m just thinking ahead.  Sincerely Damon</li>
    <li> Have used these for 15 years without complaint better than the competition.  Hard to find in store as they have store brands that suck when compared.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and my face is smooth and soft.      I recommend it highly!  Cheaper to use this with your favorite face soap than using a bunch of expensive products!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, will buy again</li>
    <li> This product was great for the price.  We use the buff pads every day, so I am sure that we will be ordering more from amazon again. It helps to exfoliate and make your skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> No miracle cream will work any such wonder if it can&#x27;t penetrate that layer of dead cells.  Daily exfoliation is the key to maximizing effectiveness of other products.  This sponge is soft enough to not irritate delicate skin but finely abrasive enough to slough off the old.</li>
    <li> cant live without, better than the sonic brushes, at exfoliation.</li>
    <li> Just like we used years ago when we were kids.&lt;br /&gt;Great for exfoliating and keeping pores clear and black head free.&lt;br /&gt;Just be gentle or you will scrub your skin raw.......</li>
    <li> These are great, I&#x27;ve been using these for 8 years. Your skin feel so clean and smooth after using one.</li>
    <li> Finally, real Buf-Puf&#x27;s! These are so much finer than the cheap drugstore version- and so much more sensible than pricey machines!&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea why someone would spend big bucks for Clarisonic and other fancy battery operated face brushes when a Buf-Puf does the same job with less hassle. Thank you, Amazon! Shopping from my living room is about as \\&quot;local\\&quot; as it gets - no wasting gas, no settling for the best approximation of what I really want. I live in a semi-rural area, and I don&#x27;t even bother checking the local shops any more - it&#x27;s a waste of time. With Super Saver shipping, I can get just what I want, EZ!</li>
    <li> I received one BufPuf and I love this product.  Five have been backordered for several weeks and I have yet to receive them.</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous!! When you get a facial that usually costs upwards of $75.00 the first thing done to your face is exfoliating the dead cells. You can do this once or twice a week just as well if not better with this wonderful little puff. It keeps my face glowing, free of unsightly roughness and bumps, and the texture looks and feels great. I only wish I could give it 10 stars!!! I have been using this for over 20 years and I wouldn&#x27;t be without it. P.S.  My skin looks fabulous!!</li>
    <li> I buy these in bulk, my local stores do not carry the regular just the soft sponge.  This is the second time I ordered 12 &amp; they last me a long time.  Will buy them again.  Thank goodness for Amazon &amp; they stuff sold here.  I can get just about anything here in Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 20+ years. I routinely get compliments on my skin. Don&#x27;t srcub hard or you will irritate your skin. Just a quick wash with your favorite cleanser once a daily.</li>
    <li> Been using these for over 30 years, they keep my combination skin smoother and get the oily part cleaner.</li>
    <li> I have two daughters and they absolutely love these facial sponges so much so that I tried one for the first time last week and they reply work well, cleaned my face nicely without exfoliating my skin greatly. I am a fan.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for years and just love the results on my face.  Everyone that visits asks me about my facial routine.  I end of giving them a buff puff to try and refer them to Amazon to purchase in bulk.  Excellent product I don&#x27;t know why they stopped selling them in stores.</li>
    <li> These make your skin so soft and clear!  I can&#x27;t live without them!!  The are perfectly scratchy but I do not recommend them for people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Great value for a pack of 6.  This product is very hard to find in stores.  I use it on my face a couple times a week with my regular face wash.  No need to buy facial exfoliator products if you use the Buf-Puf.  It really cleans out your pores.  Just go gentle on the face.  Also use it on my elbows. It&#x27;s really fantastic for feet.  I scrub my feet vigorously with it almost every day and it keeps them smooth, soft, and super-clean.  I then give my feet a thick coat of a heavy cream or Vaseline, then put on a pair of white cotton socks and wear to bed.  So if you want nice soft feet with baby-clean heels, I recommend this.</li>
    <li> Add me to the list of people that have been using this product for over 20 years.  I love what it does for my skin.  It&#x27;s tough without being too rough, and my skin is always so soft.  I love the way I look after using a buf puf.  You don&#x27;t need to exfoliate every day, max you&#x27;d want to use this is every other day.  I hope they never stop making these, I am a customer for life!</li>
    <li> Best price on Amazon!  We buy in bulk to save and since it&#x27;s a staple and non-perishable we save money!</li>
    <li> I am not as crazy about this particular sponge as I am about the Buf-Puf individual sponges, but it gets the job done.  I just find that I get more use out of the individual sponges than I do with this one. It just doesn&#x27;t seem sanitary to use after a few uses and I end up throwing it away sooner than I am suppposed to.  I feel I get more for the money with the individual sponges.</li>
    <li> Remove the outer layer(s) of dead dry skin and you reveal fresher skin that can absorb moisturizer more effectively. It also stimulates your body to make new layers to replace those removed.  These do the job effectively and can be used with any cleanser.  They rinse and air dry well. Very hard to find in the stores anymore. LOVE THEM!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve done a review of the body sponges. Same results the facial sponge is a little smaller as it should be  perfect size for the face. This product in my mind should be a must for all people. My daughters use and now my granddaughters. Cannot find in stores.</li>
    <li> A great value pack $$.  Cheapest I have found anywhere.  Kudos, Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> One of the best products I have ever used for facial cleaning.</li>
    <li> The store knock-off of the Buf-Puf is just not the same.  You have to have the original.</li>
    <li> This is the best facial sponge that I have ever used!&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this product to anyone,especially those who may be prone to blackheads.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for many years to exfoliate my skin.  The size is a good fit for my hand and they last a long time. I highly recommend them</li>
    <li> Little to harsh on the skin. I like the orgainc screen scrubbers best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years for washing my face daily. Love &#x27;em! Don&#x27;t get substitutions (unless CVS brand. Great price for these pufs.</li>
    <li> I never thought I would appreciate Prime so much!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a busy gal with work....we all know how much we love Buff Puff...with Prime you can skip the trip to the store and Voila! I had it within 48 hours.....:)</li>
    <li> This item is near to impossible to find in my area.. I received the product in record time..  Love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this face sponge for a few months and I find I have fewer to no pimples. It gets rid of blemishes fairly quickly as well if I&#x27;m consistent with it. The key is to wash with it day and night to keep your face clear. I sweat in my car when driving and at night when sleeping, so the deep exfoliation that this sponge provides is very needed.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without them</li>
    <li> I think this Buf-Puf is a little larger than what I remember buying at the drugstores but by all means does the same great job of scrubbing your fascial skin and feeling really clean and refresh.</li>
    <li> I have used these for at least 25 years and love them.  I use them on my face with phisoderm and it&#x27;s great for teens with acne and oily skin.</li>
    <li> Love these facial sponges on the with the Avon Clearskin Professional Deep Pore Cleansing Scrub or your favorite cleanser. Lather up and try them - they work!</li>
    <li> I have used these for years and love them. They are a better, smoother quality then the knock-offs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these sponges for years and was having trouble finding them in the drugstore. Good mechanical way to slough off old skin and keep face looking fresh.</li>
    <li> Cleans your face great, much better than a face cloth.  I tried the others, they don&#x27;t compare. (gentle is very gentle)</li>
    <li> I love these!  I use it with my favorite soap once a week.  I don&#x27;t want to exfoliate too often.  My face feels smooth after using this.  My husband also uses this &amp; he likes it.  My daughter&#x27;s nose and chin was getting kind of bumpy.  I started using this on her once a week and her skin is feeling much better.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product.  Just use it with your favorite mild soap &amp; you are set!&lt;br /&gt;I got the regular 6 pack, so I am set for a while.  I also have to add that I get less pimples than I did before which is awesome!</li>
    <li> I love these manual microdermabrasion sponges.  They make my face feel so clean.  I had a hard time finding them, so I bought an imposter - it just fell apart and I noticed my face didn&#x27;t feel as smooth while I was without a buf-puf.  I have a teenager who uses these &amp; so far so good.  It keeps his face clean and fairly acne free.  I often get microdermabrasion treatments which can be expensive (at least $60-100 per session).  I think this gets the dead skin off as good as any product and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Love how soft my skin feels after using!!</li>
    <li> I have been using buff puffs for 10, maybe 20, years.  I love them.  They gently clean your face day after day.  When allowed to dry properly, they do not get smelly like a wash cloth does.  (I stand mine up on it&#x27;s edge on a soap dish tray to dry.)  I have given up trying to find them in stores, and now I buy them directly from 3M or Amazon.  In this case, Amazon was more affordable than 3M.  If you are looking for a product to gently scrub your face with, I recommend Buf-Puf.</li>
    <li> My husband has very oily skin and battled blimishes all of his life.  He loves these facial sponges and uses one every day cleaning his face.</li>
    <li> I love these I have been using them for 30 years! They are the best exfoliators ever! I use them in the morning and the evening with my favorite facial soaps. I have no wrinkles and my face is very smooth and clear. LOVE THEM!</li>
    <li> Love these. Use them to Scrub my face when washing.</li>
    <li> I have used these for many many years in conjuction with Purpose gentle cleansing bar.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great exfoliator. Leaves my skin looking fresh. Very gentle and I love it.</li>
    <li> been using these for 40yrs and Amazon is one of the few places that sell the Regular.  I&#x27;ve never been a fan of the gentle ones and that seems to be what places like Wal-Mart and Rite-Aid always carry.  The ability to buy bulk ensures I always have my favorite face scrubbers handy.  Thanks Amazon...</li>
    <li> These are great!  I used to suffer from breakouts even though I&#x27;m now 51 years old.  I&#x27;m sure I just wasn&#x27;t removing all my makeup at the end of the day.  These are gentle enough for my sensitive skin but give me a fresh clean feeling and I know there is no makeup left on my face.  My 11-year old daughter is starting to have breakouts but not sure if her skin will be able to handle it as the sponge can feel a little rough on people trying for the first few times.  I&#x27;ll have to read more to see if they&#x27;ll be suitable as I would think they&#x27;d help her a lot.  Love these!</li>
    <li> Works great - my skin has been clear since using these, even through hormonal acne.  My skin has never been smoother/softer. I replace each one about every 3 weeks and use with my desert essence tea tree face wash on a daily basis.  If my skin is sensitive, I may use it every other day, but these work great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 57 year old male and a friend of mine who is a skin specialist marvels at how good my skin looks and feels. I&#x27;ve been using this item to get dirt and oil off my face for about 20 years and feel my skin has benefited from these pads. Nobody makes anything close to it and it blows away any loofah&#x27;s etc.</li>
    <li> Nice thick sponges.  Great for exfoliating.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this face puff. I&#x27;ve had increased difficulty finding them and when I do the price keeps rising. I now have a good supply and at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> No other skin-cleaning sponge is better than Buf-Puf for treatment and prevention of acne.  I&#x27;ve used it for about 30 years.  When my local drug store runs out, I try generic products or other sponges.  They just don&#x27;t last as long or work as well.  The Gentle Buf-Puf is useless for acne, but may be suitable for more sensitive skin without acne.</li>
    <li> I like these facial sponges.  I use them with my zinc soap to help tame the seborrheic dermatitis.  They work great for getting rid of all the flakes on my face.  I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> I have tried all kinds of face washes to exfoliate.  Everything left my face feeling ruff and uneven. I&#x27;m over 60 and some brown ruff age spots have started to show up. With these the ruff feeling is gone. I use them on my face neck and chest areas. Nothing works as well as these pads with a mild soap. I have tried store brands that fall apart after a use or two :{ These are all I use now.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have been searching for it in my local stores for a couple of years and I&#x27;m so glad I found it. I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and can&#x27;t go a day without it. It helps keeps my skin clean, clear and smooth feeling. It exfoliates without being harsh. I even take it with me when we go camping. Highly recommend this for women of all ages.</li>
    <li> A must have sponge to properly cleanse your face with a foaming gel cleanser.</li>
    <li> This is not available locally, but thanks to Amazon and adding it to another order it came fairly quickly.  The only problem was figuring out the correct item from several that were similar.</li>
    <li> I have been using these facial sponges for 25 years and wouldn&#x27;t think of using anything different on my face.</li>
    <li> It is excellent for exfoliating your skin without the need for chemicals. Used regularly it makes your skin look great</li>
    <li> best thing for my face</li>
    <li> Great product.  I wish it was attached to a reacher so I can scrub my back. Great price for a pack of 6.</li>
    <li> Hubby and I have both used Buff Puffs since high school (just attended his 25th reunion, ugh!), but the regular ones are hard to find. This 6-pack was a good deal and will last us about a year. Can&#x27;t beat the super cheap &amp; fast shipping with Prime!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Buf-Pufs for decades and will forever. I feel the difference if I forget to take one on a trip of even a week or two.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great value.  Works well.</li>
    <li> Why local stores don&#x27;t carry these now is a mystery, but thank goodness they&#x27;re still being made.  I&#x27;ve enjoyed the gentle exfoliation and deep cleansing of these pads on a daily basis for many years.  Cheaper pads are too scratchy and they break down quickly.  I only need about two Buf-Pufs a year because they hold up so well.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve reached a solid middle age and have used Buf Pufs consistently since my 20&#x27;s.  I love this 3M product.  Buf Puf&#x27;s are hard to find these days in stores and I&#x27;m concerned 3M will discontinue them.  They are wonderful for cleaning off dead skin cells, leaving your face smooth and clean and refreshed for the day.  I still remember the small store pharmacy clerk who told me about them when I was in my 20&#x27;s.  I&#x27;ve since told others who&#x27;ve also become fans. We like to think using them has been the equivalent of a facial peel - over time that is.  Do go easy the first time using them.  They are gently abrasive.  There is a gentle version of this product, but I (and the other users I know) prefer the regular. Glad I could find them online!</li>
    <li> I love these. they worked so well. I have eczema so it helps get rid of dead skin cells that pile up.</li>
    <li> These are the best daily facial sponges. I have used them for many years and they help keep your skin looking younger. I recommend these for any one at any age as you can use your own personal cleanser with these.</li>
    <li> Works great. Help prevent  razor bumps.</li>
    <li> Love washing my face with the Buf-Puf</li>
    <li> Been using these for years.  Wish they were cheaper, but they do last a long time.</li>
    <li> I use these in place of my wash cloth.  I love them.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s always depressing buying Buf-Pufs because they&#x27;re just so darned expensive.  You used to be able to get cheap knockoffs that were almost identical, but I&#x27;ve found the quality of these has gone downhill, and you get a face sponge that shreds after about a week&#x27;s use.  I&#x27;m definitely not saving money like that.  I finally thought to check Amazon for a bulk buy and have been very happy with the price, but happier that I&#x27;m back to the real deal.  Buf Puf is what has kept my skin looking so good for so many years.  I am 43 and get constant comments on my skin.  People stop me on the street to ask what I do.  The dermatologist or aesthetician will ask me what I do.  As soon as I tell them &amp;#34;Dr. Bronner&#x27;s and Buf Puf&amp;#34;, they start in on why that&#x27;s so bad for your skin, even though the question arose because my skin looks so great.  I have never used chemicals on my body, including my face, and so I need the mechanical &amp;#34;abrasion&amp;#34; to aid in exfoliation, and it keeps me from getting pimples.  I&#x27;ve succumbed to pressure a number of times in my life and let someone talk me into &amp;#34;gently massaging the cleanser into my skin&amp;#34;.  Nope.  Pimples.  Dry skin.  Flaky skin.  Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but Buf Puf is not the devil, and is truly one of the essential items I would take with me onto a deserted island.  I use the white sponge, but there&#x27;s an orange sponge that&#x27;s a lighter scrub and holds up well.  The pink one is super-gentle and shreds on me but might be lovely for really delicate skin.  If you haven&#x27;t used one of these before, start slowly and gently and work up to a more intensive scrub or you might look like you gave your face rug burn!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine. I liked the fact that it was a 6 pack. Bought it for my fiance and myself. My daughter uses it too. Maybe once a week.</li>
    <li> I used to use these things as a kid and they really work. I just started using them again and my skin has cleared up and my pores aren&#x27;t quite as black. My boyfriend uses them now too.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product.</li>
    <li> great product for aging skin</li>
    <li> Top quality pads by 3M.  Good for scrubbing to prevent acne.  Don&#x27;t rub too long or hard or you will over exfoliate (rub away too much of top layer of skin) and have red areas.  They are expensive and you have to buy a box of six, but cheaper than buying at local stores, if you can find them (I could not find 3M Buf Puf at CVS, Walgreen nor Wal Mart).  I expected better price for buying six-pack box so I gave it only 4 stars instead of 5.  Usual good Amazon service, delivery in 7 or 8 days.</li>
    <li> I use my Buf-Puf every day, have been for many years. This is the only place I can find to purchase it now. I love that I can get 6 and stock up as others in my family use them as well.</li>
    <li> Love it; they work as great as they did years and years ago.  Finally found these on Amazon after not finding them in the stores.  Yeah.</li>
    <li> My Buf-Puf arrived promptly.  So glad Amazon carries them since I can no longer find them in any store.  I have used the Buf-Puf since the 70&#x27;s when a dermatologist suggested it.  Keeps skin smooth and young looking.</li>
    <li> Been using these for years and they clean and exfoliate great.</li>
    <li> These are essential and work so well.</li>
    <li> love them and they are getting real hard to find at the local stores</li>
    <li> Excellent,would deal with again</li>
    <li> I have hormonal acne in the chin area. Using these sponges twice a day with a moisturizing cleanser helps keep it at bay. Use a light touch or your skin will get red and sensitive after a few days.</li>
    <li> Good product, fast delivery</li>
    <li> I have used these for years, but lately they are hard to find. The imitation ones are limp and cheap, don&#x27;t last. Glad to have the real thing.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I can&#x27;t seem to find these at Wal-Mart or Target anymore, but I&#x27;m glad I could get them on Amazon.  They were exactly what I expected!</li>
    <li> What can be said about these wonderful face sponges that hasn&#x27;t already been said? I LOVE these things! There are MANY substitutes - but NOTHING is as good as the original Buf-Puf. I went for years not being able to find them in stores (because they don&#x27;t sell them in stores anymore, apparently). One day I decided to look here on Amazon and I&#x27;m so glad I did - my skin is so happy to have my Buf-Puf back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Buf-Puf facial sponge for 20yrs now, since I was 15 to be exact and I LOVE it! This product exfoliates my skin and always leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed. My kids, 21 &amp; 11 are now growing up using it and NEVER deal with any acne problems. I can&#x27;t go without having this product, it is a staple in my home.</li>
    <li> I used this once and i didn&#x27;t feel it did anything. I stopped using it. I wanted more of a tough scrubber then a soft sponge.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell whether or not this is good for my skin but there is something viscerally satisfying about abrading your face with this terrifying exfoliator.</li>
    <li> I love the regular Buf Puf and use it daily.  The quality far surpasses any of the look-alike sponges.  It lasts MUCH longer and stays white.  It took just a few days to get used to it, but i have been hooked on it now for years.  i feel so clean and don&#x27;t need to use any other product to feel like my face has been exfoliated and really clean.  I keep one in my suitcase.  It is definitely one of my Go-To items, and the brand name does makes a difference.</li>
    <li> lasts a long time and this makes my wife happy, happy wife happy life</li>
    <li> works well and exfoliation is very thorough. No need to use everyday but can. It lasts pretty long, but I change once a month for sanitary reasons.</li>
    <li> I started using these little scrubbers some 20 years ago.  I still use them.  I have had to use store brand imitations for a number of years however because they are so impossible to find.  Then about six months ago, I finally saw one in my local store.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference!  Still as powerful in cleaning but not as harshly abrasive.  I get compliments on my skin all the time. I always tell people that its because of Buf-Puf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t matter what your age... It is never to late to start exfoliating!</li>
    <li> I tried buying cheaper knock offs.  They are definitely not worth it.  These are the best!  They quickly scrub away all dead skin and they last a long time!</li>
    <li> I use these for all over bathing, not just my face.  They are more gentle than the hard sponges and are just as effective.</li>
    <li> I have been using Buf-Puf facial sponges and body sponges for years and love them. They are great for exfoliating and leave my skin soft and smooth.  I have difficulty finding Buf-Puf products in local drugstores and other brands of facial sponges do not measure up. I am so greatful they are available through Amazon!</li>
    <li> I ordered a six pack of Buf-Puf but only received one sponge. Had all six arrived, it would have been great. However, that is way too much to pay for only one sponge. I don&#x27;t understand what the problem was with my order.</li>
    <li> I bought these online because my sister can no longer find them in stores around here. The price was right and it&#x27;s a product she loves. She even uses the used ones for all kinds of cleaning tasks around the house and garage; so she gets two uses out of them.</li>
    <li> Great stuff for a puff. !!!!</li>
    <li> Have used for years -</li>
    <li> Buf puffs are difficult to find! Excellent for everyday facial exfoliating.</li>
    <li> Nothing compares to Buf-Puf  brand.  Still have a few of these in my stash over a year after this purchase.  They hold up better than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried using.</li>
    <li> Always a great product. I have used them for years and I still love them. If you haven&#x27;t tried them yet, you should.</li>
    <li> I keep one of these handy, and also the small disposable to keep my skin fresh and blackhead free.  Even my husband has his own pad.</li>
    <li> I use every night before going to bed to help me overcome morning breakouts. As a man i have really taut skin  so i use the sponge to help clean off excess skin cells and oil before shaving. it leaves you&#x27;re face feeling renewed and clean</li>
    <li> I had this item in my wish list forever and I&#x27;m so glad I finally bought it.&lt;br /&gt;I use the buff puff with a good facial cleaner in the shower and wow - it exfoliates more effectively that anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried it all. I really feel like my serums and moisturizers are able to penetrate after using the buff puff instead of sitting on top of my skin. For the first few uses, I suggest using a very light hand, as it can be a little harsh.</li>
    <li> These buff pads are the best.  I tried a less $$ brand and No comparison.  I use them with a sugar scrub and it really makes a difference with my skin.  REALLY squeaky clean.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this item while serving in the Air Force.  I love this product...I use it on my face and body.  Lately they have been hard to find at the exchange, so I have been ordering from Amazon at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I have used Buf~Puf&#x27;s for years.  I always get compliments on my complexion.  I&#x27;m sure part of it is genetics but the rest is the Buf~Puf.  Keeps your skin glowing.  I hope they never stop making this product.  You can hardly find them in the stores anymore so I have to order them online.  That&#x27;s fine with me!  I love &#x27;em!</li>
    <li> I started using this because I had dry skin and rough patches on my face. One review said that it helped with fine lines and wrinkles... NOT FOR ME. After using these, my forehead fine lines were more noticeable. So I stopped using these on my face but I instead used them on my legs before shaving. Super smooth. Probably won&#x27;t buy these again but I&#x27;ll use the 6 pack till it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> My wife and I have been using these sponges for years.  They are much easier to use and store than a loofah.  They last a reasonable amount of scrubbings and leave you with much younger looking skin, that feels cleaner than using a conventional wash cloth.  Our granddaughter was able to get rid of her acne in a short time by using them</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 20 years with a glycerine soap and a good moisturizer.  Barely a wrinkle on my face.  And I am not young by any means.  It works.</li>
    <li> can never go wrong with the original Buf Puf!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and the product was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Loved buying more than one good product</li>
    <li> It saddens me to write this review because I&#x27;ve been using Buf Puf since I was about 12. I always attributed my youthful appearance to daily exfoliation with the Buf Puf, but now I think my cystic acne in my 30&#x27;s and 40&#x27;s was certainly exacerbated if not caused by the Buf Puf. I discontinued use of this product and switched to a skin care line called Glytone (buy at Dermstore.com) and haven&#x27;t had a breakout in over 2 months. Unfortunately I&#x27;m convinced the harsh exfoliation causes skin to rebel and break out. I won&#x27;t use again.</li>
    <li> This brand is very hard to find in my area...they usually have the cheap kind, that don&#x27;t last at all. I am so happy I can find this quality product that does the job excellently at a great price!</li>
    <li> These really make my face feel clean.  And, they last for months.  I use it everyday on my face in the shower.  I have used it on other parts of my body as well and it works on them, too.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I bought the original BUF puf because I know my skin can handle some roughness and I love these! My face never felt so clean. I was looking at one of those automatic face brushes but so glad I didn&#x27;t spend the money.  I have very oily skin and these work great for me. Thank you for a great product.</li>
    <li> The Buf-Puf Reusable Facial Sponge is the best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used, it creates a rich thick lather with any type of soap and it really deep cleans, (Regular for most men, Gentle or Extra Gentle for most women).</li>
    <li> I love my buf-puf.  Nothing cleans the face like a buf-puf.  I begin my facial with a nice cleaning and then move onto the moisturizer.  Buf-puf makes the whole face shine.</li>
    <li> These are the absolute best. I like the \\&quot;normal\\&quot; ones. It feels slightly harsh but I like that so it&#x27;s fine. My skin is so smooth now. I&#x27;ll never not use this product. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I purchased the &#x27;regular&#x27; pads which are far more abrasive than I used years ago.  They work well for hand cleaning, removing algae from aquarium glass, and cleaning carbon off the cylinder face of revolvers, but I find them too abrasive for facial skin.</li>
    <li> These are great for cleaning your face, feet &amp; body. Just a super product, I would be more than happy to recommend product to anyone,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for decades. I&#x27;ve always had rough skin and this product always clears the skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using these since the 80&#x27;s.  Good and effective product</li>
    <li> My Friends and family always notice when I use my Buff Puff, my skin really glows!</li>
    <li> Very good facial sponge.</li>
    <li> I was so glad to find them here.the new styled  sponge&#x27;s are no where near as  good and lasting.</li>
    <li> I love using these sponges. Exfoliating while washing my face. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using Buf Puf since high school (I am in my 50&#x27;s now). It keeps the dead skin cells from clogging my pores, which helps prevent old looking skin.</li>
    <li> Use these to scrub your face with some good glycerine soap and your face will look and feel great.</li>
    <li> I ordered Buf-Puf because I had used it a number of years ago.  I have had a lot of problems finding Buf-Puf to purchase in stores in my area. When I first used this product I loved what it did for my face.  It really cleans the skin of dead skin cells and makes your skin glow.  I would recommend this product to anyone that wants to make their skin feel and look re-vitalized. It comes in regular and gentle sponges for the face and they also have a sponge for the body which is especially good for elbows and heels and also makes your skin feel really soft after use.  FYI -- Gently use this sponge on your face area as you don&#x27;t want to have irritated and red skin after use.  It really makes a difference when you begin to use Buf-Puf. Thank you AMAZON for offering this product!!  Janie C</li>
    <li> I have been using this item for about 20years. They use to have a medicated version that worked great, but now I just use with a neutrogena bar(regular).&lt;br /&gt;I also replace with each bar of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andre</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since I was about 13 years old (ahem, that&#x27;s 40 years, folks), and quite simply, nothing works better. Don&#x27;t waste your money on fancy exfoliators and expensive whirling electronic face brushes. But-Puf cannot be beat.</li>
    <li> I use these buf pufs as part of my beauty regiment when I wash my face. I suggest a mild cleanser since the pufs can be pretty rigorous (like, don&#x27;t use these with a scrub). I also find these very helpful with combating ingrown hairs. I was satisfied with this transaction and continue to purchase from this seller when available.</li>
    <li> Great facial cleaner! I use it before shaving, to help clean and soften my beard. Recommended for black men to use before shaving to reduce razor bumps.</li>
    <li> I have used Buf-Pufs for over 20 years now. I must say at my age I get compliments on how good my skin looks.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Buf-Puf. No imitation pufs for me.</li>
    <li> I will use these until I am no longer able to wash my face.</li>
    <li> A couple years back you could find these in any grocery store.  Not anymore.  The only place I have found them locally is Ulta and price does not compare to these.</li>
    <li> I love these little face scrubbers.  Used to find them at the drugstore, but now they only offer their store brands, which are decidedly inferior.  Thank heaven for the internet!</li>
    <li> I have. Used it for 30 yrs in the morning and at night.I have magnificent skin on my face and use Sorbolene cream as a moisturiser.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how hard this product would be before I purchased.  I cant use it.  I have 5 of them left if anyone wants them.  : (</li>
    <li> This product is great for deep cleaning your face and lifting dead skin.  People with sensitive skin may want to choose a different facial sponge that is less abrasive.  Overall I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> My super-secret weapon for keeping my skin looking great. I&#x27;ve used these since I was in high school. They stopped carrying these in stores, and the ones you find in drugstores and grocery stores aren&#x27;t as good as these ones. I order the box of 6 and use 1 a month. You can use any cleaner, it&#x27;s the exfoliating sponge that really does the trick. I will continue to order these til I die.</li>
    <li> These one are not the best for your face</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been scrubbing my face for over 40 years with these. NOTHING works as well. My skin looks better than either of my two sisters who have had work done. We are in our early 50&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> The first time I ever used the Buf-Puf, it was recommended to me by a very &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; dermataologist. He was able to tell me everything about the history of my face just by looking at it. After he could pinpoint the different ages and areas where I had experienced acne, and told me all the pros and cons of the different medications available, he recommended the Buf-Puf. At this point his word was golden, however, my first experience was rough. The texture does not feel good to the face, but it is so abrasive that it actually works. Since my initial use, I have not stopped using the Buf-Puf and it has been around a year. The only thing I do not like is that you have to replace it about every two weeks (it lasts longer if you prevent it from getting wet). Other than that this product is awesome and I recommend it to anyone with acne or scarring on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. It will hurt at first, scrub harder.</li>
    <li> Love these, They exfoliate beautifully and not too much. Great for cleansing your face.</li>
    <li> These are great.  For deep cleaning your facial pores and neck/back, I have found nothing better.  I&#x27;ve been using them for about 40 years and they haven&#x27;t changed or cheapened this product in all that time.  Very refreshing that they haven&#x27;t messed with perfection.</li>
    <li> These sponges are not for the faint at heart.  They are very rough but that is what I need around the nose forehead and for ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> Item purchased and delivery were as promised - 100%</li>
    <li> Use them all the time consistently.  They are great exfoliators because I can feel the difference on the surface of my skin when I don&#x27;t use them.</li>
    <li> Great price for a package of 6.  I hate trying to find these at the grocery store.  Buying them in a package of six (6) will keep the hubby and I stocked for a while.  Buf-Puf is a great brand.</li>
    <li> These are not too rough for gentle skin and do a great job of exfoliating.  They also survive a weekly machine washing with Clorox, although I change out the pads once a month.</li>
    <li> These buf-puf sponges make my skin feel very clean and work as great exfoliators.  I have very senstive skin, but these work well!  It&#x27;s good to change them out (they do wear out), though depending on how much they are used--they can be used longer than directed on instructions.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Buf-Puf for over 30 years and attribute a far smoother, nearly wrinkle free complexion than most of my (mature) friends. Have turned all my young family members on to this product. Others have come out with a competitive product, but I&#x27;ve found nothing is as good as Buf-Puf, and was happy when I found it again thru Amazon.  Can highly recommend using it once a day, every single day.</li>
    <li> This is just what I have been looking for. The store brands don&#x27;t last as long as the real deal. Thanks</li>
    <li> These are by far the best quality facial sponges I have ever used. And the pack of 6 is really also the most cost effective idea. I have been using just one of the sponges for a month now and it is still fine. Just remember to  rinse it and put it on a dry place every time you use it and it will last quite long. The only reason I gave this product 4 instead of 5 stars is because it is far too harsh for my skin- I should have gotten the sensitive skin. I didn&#x27;t think of doing that to begin with because my skin is not all that sensitive-I used the almost identical sponges from other manufactures and I didn&#x27;t think they were harsh. These sponges are excellent for washing skin that is prone to breaking out and cleaning all traces of make up but you better first try both varieties and decide which one is best for your skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent for exfoliating.</li>
    <li> This product has been around for years  and it is still fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;I mini facial every time you use it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, but can&#x27;t find it in any local stores. So grateful to be able to not only buy it online, but to be able to buy a multi-pak at a much cheaper price!</li>
    <li> I wish I could buy these locally.&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;m all stocked up w/ a set of 6.&lt;br /&gt;Store brands don&#x27;t measure up, you need the name brand.</li>
    <li> Like a lot of reviewers have said, I have used these for ages.  For some reason they are really, really hard to find in stores, so it is great to be able to order them online in bulk.</li>
    <li> Used these for years ~ love that it cleans and exfoliates.</li>
    <li> Works well for facial scrubbing.</li>
    <li> Great to find these. Grew up with them and have a hard time finding them in stores.</li>
    <li> So happy to find these on line.  They work great!</li>
    <li> fine but too expensive found some at 2.50</li>
    <li> These look like they will hold up pretty well. Buying these here seem like a good deal too because at the supermarket near my house, these cost about $5.00 each.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find these anywhere, fortunately Amazon had them. I love these easy on your skin, but deep cleaning.</li>
    <li> Glad i looked on Amazon. Found them by accident while looking for Christmas presents. I used these for years to keep my face exfoliated and to reduce the tendency of my oily skin to form blackheads etc. I am 53 and still using them. The local CVS makes a knock-off that&#x27;s not nearly as good.</li>
    <li> I have been using these facial sponges since I was in my 20&#x27;s, so about 30 years!  Lately they have been harder to find.  In the past I used them every day when I washed my face.  Now I use them twice a week.  They are especially useful on the days I have used sunscreen to help remove the gunk.  They last very well and I usually use one pad for about 6 months or so if I only use them on my face.  Also use them on my arms and legs before the use of artificial tanning products to exfoliate my skin, they are awesome for that!  Be sure to use them gently as they could irritate your skin if you were to enthusiastic .</li>
    <li> Great product received in a timely manner.  This is an inexpensive way to exfoliate and does a great job so save your money on more expensive options.</li>
