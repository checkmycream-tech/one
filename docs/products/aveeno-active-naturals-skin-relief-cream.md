      <li>it hydrates chapped hands and absorbs quickly ...</li>
      <li>It is not greasy and in my case absorbs quickly and does not stop working after each washing.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It absorbs quickly, allowing me to use the computer, tools, etc.</li>

      <li>; pretty quickly, and there&#x27;s no odor to be found, foul or otherwise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>really can&#x27;t say enough about this product, its high quality, and the great value.</li>
      <li>It just goes on and disappears right away.</li>
      <li>/&gt;But this stuff hits all the right marks.  </li>
      <li>There really isn&#x27;t anything special about this lotion.  </li>
      <li>If you are looking for a great product that will seem to cure skin problems on your hands, search no more.</li>
      <li>I have my hands in water much too much, and this is a good choice for daily use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more pricey than most other intense lotions, but</li>
      <li>This is good for a daily hand cream when you wash your hands frequently throughout the day and it moisturizers without being greasy or oily.</li>
      <li>I need this to be thicker and more deeply penetrating.  </li>
      <li>It was exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>After the first use, my hands were moisturized and no longer cracked.  </li>
      <li>I recommend trying it out in a store first</li>
      <li>Also it weighs only 3.5oz(allowed in the carry-on baggage), it&#x27;s a good travel companion especially in the air trips.  </li>
      <li>I just purchased this item about a week ago after giving up my beloved Neutrogena norwegian formula due to it&#x27;s paraben laden ingredients, glad to say this one it&#x27;s definitely working for me!</li>
      <li>and I squeezed a whole lot of air before I got any product out.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing but not a bit greasy; truly odorless (not unscented but chemical-ish).</li>
      <li>Fast absorbing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s almost fragrance free which is a big plus.  </li>
      <li>my hands were cracked from so much hand washing.</li>
      <li>Some are oily/greasy, others don&#x27;t absorb very well</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>This Aveeno hand cream is non greasy and really lasts for 24 hours.</li>
      <li>No fragrance, very moisturizing, non-greasy.  </li>
      <li>This is fantastic hand cream that I&#x27;ve used for several years.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really ineffective because the water doesn&#x27;t penetrate the wax...</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like much, and you just need a bit to get moisturized.</li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>And this lotion is good, I say lotion because it isn&#x27;t that thick.</li>
      <li>It does not leave a greasy feeling like many other lotions I have tried.</li>
      <li>For really irritated hands, Aveeno Hand Cream Intense Relief with Natural Colloidal Oatmeal is IT!</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Ah, sweet mystery of life, at last I&#x27;ve fouuuund youuuuuu</li>
      <li>(I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily say it lasts all day, as it claims, but it is by far superior to all other \\&quot;Intense relieve hand</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried various hand lotions for years and this is about the best, even compared to expensive products.</li>
      <li>All their products are super, and this hand cream is especially long-lansting.</li>
      <li>I rubbed the cream in, put on the gloves and the very next morning, my hands were soft and pain free.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;By the way, I live in Colorado, and on most days the humidity is down in the teens (tomorrow it&#x27;s forecasted to be in the mid-single digits), so something that works quickly, allows me to keep working, and actually works is something I value.</li>
      <li>This is a highly recommended product for anyone with OCD or who spends a lot of time with their hands in the water.</li>
      <li>The smell isn&#x27;t the greatest (I was hoping for the same smell as their nighttime eye cream) but it doesn&#x27;t smell awful, I guess the best way to describe the smell is plain.</li>
      <li>This is, by far, my hands down favorite for hand care.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t buy a single tube, get a pack of 3 for $16.88 you can save 3 bucks, also as an Amazon Prime member you&#x27;ll get second day shipping free!</li>
      <li>Have you ever made the mistake of trying to clean up a wax spill with a wet rag?  </li>
      <li>but I wanted to make sure people were not really expecting it to last through hand washings.</li>
      <li>It absorbs instantly and you don&#x27;t need very much.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used lotions and creams in the past to combat this, and although many of them work fine in that regard, they always have some deficit that ruins the experience.  </li>
      <li>Leaves hands soft.  </li>
      <li>It is moisturizing but if I go to wash my hands (which is often since I have a two month old daughter)</li>
      <li>my hands soak it up like water and the after-effect is just extremely soft, relieved hands.</li>
      <li>and I wake up with soft, moisturized hands.</li>
      <li>This is the only lotion at a reasonable price that works on my hands.  </li>
      <li>My hands get very dry after handwashing, and most other lotions I&#x27;ve bought are either too greasy/oily, have too much perfume, only moisturize for an hour or so, or doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin.</li>
      <li>The only hand cream that quickly resolved my son&#x27;s dry skin problem.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything that can protect and repair dry winter hands better that isn&#x27;t a greasy mess.  </li>
      <li>Not deeply moisturizing and certainly does not feel moisturized hours later.</li>
      <li>In the winter, my hands always get super dried out from tying my laces.</li>
      <li>I only have to apply it once a day, and my hands feel as soft as a baby&#x27;s you-know-what!  </li>
      <li>No other hand cream on the market can match it&#x27;s ability to protect so well that the skin can begin to heal.</li>
      <li>The one I received was only half full.  </li>
      <li>Fragrance free, dries fast and leaves the least greasy feel of all creams and really helps my dried out hands alot.  </li>
      <li>It is not at all greasy, absorbs easily, and is one of the very few personal care products we repurchse over and over again.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to last too long, but then again I don&#x27;t use the whole bottle at one time.</li>
      <li>The Aveeno hand cream is the complete opposite...</li>
      <li>This Aveeno product is particularly helpful for dry skin.  </li>
      <li>Its worth every single cents i spent.</li>
      <li>The price isn&#x27;t bad for what you get, but I will probably not re-order this particular brand and try something else that really might be more long-lasting.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for only a short amount of time and my hands are so soft!</li>
      <li>Also, it really does last for a very long time!</li>
      <li>However, how I recieved this item is a whole other story.</li>
      <li>I have to wash my hand often due to my job as a Flight Attendant.</li>
      <li>This is great for anyone who has dry hands from being in a cold climate or constantly washing your hands.</li>
      <li>Other lotions have actually made me cough from too much</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, it soaks right into the skin, and actually does last through a few hand-washings.  </li>
      <li>When I found that my husband had taken my Aveeno Hand Cream to work -- and failed to return it -- I was really upset as I couldn&#x27;t find it at my local drugstore, which is where I found it originally.  </li>
      <li>I mean you can pay four times as much for some crazy natural skin care products made in Europe out of Unicorns or something, but if you just need some good lotion, Aveeno is my go-to.  </li>
      <li>My hands are notoriously dry and in 2 days of using this lotion they were soft.</li>
      <li>With in a week all the dry skin faded away and it retained the natural complexion.</li>

<li> I only have to apply it once a day, and my hands feel as soft as a baby&#x27;s you-know-what!  </li>
<li> No other hand cream on the market can match it&#x27;s ability to protect so well that the skin can begin to heal.</li>
<li> The one I received was only half full.  </li>
<li> Fragrance free, dries fast and leaves the least greasy feel of all creams and really helps my dried out hands alot.  </li>
<li> It is not at all greasy, absorbs easily, and is one of the very few personal care products we repurchse over and over again.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to last too long, but then again I don&#x27;t use the whole bottle at one time.</li>
<li> The Aveeno hand cream is the complete opposite...</li>
<li> This Aveeno product is particularly helpful for dry skin.  </li>
<li> Its worth every single cents i spent.</li>
<li> The price isn&#x27;t bad for what you get, but I will probably not re-order this particular brand and try something else that really might be more long-lasting.</li>
<li> I have been using it for only a short amount of time and my hands are so soft!</li>
<li> Also, it really does last for a very long time!</li>
<li> However, how I recieved this item is a whole other story.</li>
<li> I have to wash my hand often due to my job as a Flight Attendant.</li>
<li> This is great for anyone who has dry hands from being in a cold climate or constantly washing your hands.</li>
<li> Other lotions have actually made me cough from too much</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not greasy, it soaks right into the skin, and actually does last through a few hand-washings.  </li>
<li> When I found that my husband had taken my Aveeno Hand Cream to work -- and failed to return it -- I was really upset as I couldn&#x27;t find it at my local drugstore, which is where I found it originally.  </li>
<li> I mean you can pay four times as much for some crazy natural skin care products made in Europe out of Unicorns or something, but if you just need some good lotion, Aveeno is my go-to.  </li>
<li> My hands are notoriously dry and in 2 days of using this lotion they were soft.</li>
<li> With in a week all the dry skin faded away and it retained the natural complexion.</li>
<li> I need to be patient and try maybe another product which comes in similar packaging such as these former two and compare again if it actually has sat too long in storage</li>
<li> My hands always feel dry and tight after my morning routine, particularly once I&#x27;ve washed them with soap post-hair-styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I have extremely dry hands, especially during the winter</li>
<li> My hands have actually been so dry that the skin was cracked and hand washing and drying was torture.</li>
<li> After a few days of using the Aveeno hand cream my hands were completely healed.</li>
<li> the top of my hands were getting soooo dry b/c of the cold weather</li>
<li> I bought this product at my local drugstore because my hands are extremely rough and dry.</li>
<li> Usually when a product not in a glass container smells like plastic, it means either the sun has beaten on it and it loses its potential worth; or the product has sat too long on the counter; or both.  </li>
<li> It does last a LOT longer than any other hand/body lotions(including</li>
<li> It has a very different feel than any other lotion I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>

<li> I tried all type of dry skin lotions</li>

<li> My hands are getting all dry and chappy on me, so I buy this cream and things are already picking up.</li>
<li> After chemo, my skin was so dry it hurt.  </li>
<li> I tend to have dry hands in the morning and this moisturizes without making my hands feel greasy.</li>
<li> My hands get especially dry, but by using this product regularly I can keep my hands from getting too dry.</li>
<li> My hands were getting a bit dry from work, so I looked up this hand cream to try out.</li>
<li> Seems bit expensive when compared to regular creams, but defintely worth the money.</li>
<li> /&gt;This slightly moistens my hands but after a few minutes they feel normal again.</li>
<li> Few other products I have bought from Amazon, such as CeraVe foaming cleanser has also produce the same smell.  </li>
<li> After applying, I realized the hand cream wasn&#x27;t greasy, but it also wasn&#x27;t that moisturizing for my extremely rough and dry hands.</li>
<li> I have very dry skin.</li>
<li> I had a chemical spill on my fingers when working in lab which left my fingers dried and cracked at places.</li>
<li> I fully expected to like this.  </li>
<li> It also seems to rub off on my clothing, which I can see if I&#x27;m wearing black or dark blue.  </li>
<li> Fragrance free, doesn&#x27;t leave my hands greasy, soothes my cracked fingers, and isn&#x27;t expensive!  </li>

<li> Even our grown son, who is very adverse to greasy creams, but who suffers from very red, cracked hands, uses this product.</li>
<li> The one I received is half empty, and it is not sealed!</li>
<li> Just leave it in for a half a minute or so, and your hands don&#x27;t feel oily at all unlike other lotions.</li>
<li> A small amount goes a long way and leaves my hands feeling relieved and moisturized.  </li>
<li> It is not worth for my money.</li>
<li> I use it on average 2x/day.  </li>
<li> I have a habit of washing my hands excessively, hence leaving my hands dry, achy and skin peeling off.</li>
<li> Because you need so little of the product to accomplish the task, this will last you (or at least it lasts me) MONTHS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It&#x27;s slightly waxy.</li>
<li> I used Aveeno on my kids when they were little for a variety of things, always came through for me.</li>
<li> I found this to be a life saver after having constantly dried out hands from changing diapers and washing my hands a million times a day.</li>
<li> No greasy feel, just plain relief.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is supposed to have a seal at all, but there was no seal on my item at all.</li>
<li> I use this lotion once in the morning and once at night and have no problems with excessive dryness.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The best hand cream out there - hands down!  Moisturizing but not greasy, penetrates quickly. Even my husband uses it.</li>
    <li> I have a habit of washing my hands excessively, hence leaving my hands dry, achy and skin peeling off. Gross. The only product that eases the pain or prevents it entirely from occurring is this beautiful Aveeno Hand Cream here! This is a highly recommended product for anyone with OCD or who spends a lot of time with their hands in the water.</li>
    <li> My hands are notoriously dry and in 2 days of using this lotion they were soft. Kind of amazing. Plus, this product is rated fairly well on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep database.</li>
    <li> The product itself is just okay. It&#x27;s no where as thick or creamy as I&#x27;d like. For the price, I don&#x27;t mind it not being perfect. However, how I recieved this item is a whole other story. I&#x27;m not sure if this is supposed to have a seal at all, but there was no seal on my item at all. The tube looked dirty - used. When I squeezed the tube to extract the product I noticed that it was halfway gone and I squeezed a whole lot of air before I got any product out.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion.  I think it is the best out there.  I don&#x27;t use any other lotion out there this is the best.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Goes on dry instead of greasy.  Has dimethicone or something that seals moisture into my hands.  I appreciate this while my wife won&#x27;t use it for fear of non-natural chemicals.</li>
    <li> When I found that my husband had taken my Aveeno Hand Cream to work -- and failed to return it -- I was really upset as I couldn&#x27;t find it at my local drugstore, which is where I found it originally.  But as always, Amazon came through and I have it again!  It&#x27;s not greasy, it soaks right into the skin, and actually does last through a few hand-washings.  I only have to apply it once a day, and my hands feel as soft as a baby&#x27;s you-know-what!  This is the best hand cream I&#x27;ve ever found and I&#x27;ve tried dozens.</li>
    <li> I had a chemical spill on my fingers when working in lab which left my fingers dried and cracked at places. I tried applying different creams that only gave me temporary relief form dryness. This cream is amazing. The number of times I have to apply the cream has reduced and also I continue to have the smooth effect on my fingers..I love this cream.</li>
    <li> ...and it&#x27;s only Dec 22.  I need this to be thicker and more deeply penetrating.  I could also probably just drink more water, so never mind.  5 stars!</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Ah, sweet mystery of life, at last I&#x27;ve fouuuund youuuuuu...\\&quot; Very moisturizing but not a bit greasy; truly odorless (not unscented but chemical-ish). Fast absorbing. This is it! Ahhh, sweet relief.</li>
    <li> I have gone through many lotions through the years.  I rate this product the best and will continue to buy it.  It&#x27;s more pricey than most other intense lotions, but well worth the money.  It lasts 24 hours on my feet, but it only lasts through a couple hand washings with soap.  It&#x27;s almost fragrance free which is a big plus.  Other lotions have actually made me cough from too much fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product.</li>
    <li> I had problem of having severe dry skin in the hand, when it&#x27;s exposed to severe cold weather. I tried all type of dry skin lotions but.... Finally I was recommended Aveeno by the Dermatologist. With in a week all the dry skin faded away and it retained the natural complexion. Seems bit expensive when compared to regular creams, but defintely worth the money. Also it weighs only 3.5oz(allowed in the carry-on baggage), it&#x27;s a good travel companion especially in the air trips.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also don&#x27;t buy a single tube, get a pack of 3 for $16.88 you can save 3 bucks, also as an Amazon Prime member you&#x27;ll get second day shipping free!</li>
    <li> I have to wash my hand often due to my job as a Flight Attendant. This cream lasts even after washing. I have been using it for years now.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my feet after showering, hands and arms due to sun exposure, it&#x27;s wonderful, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is our household&#x27;s favorite hand cream. It is not at all greasy, absorbs easily, and is one of the very few personal care products we repurchse over and over again.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry hands, especially during the winter and I have tried so many hand creams and have never been satisfied until now. This hand cream is amazing! I have been using it for only a short amount of time and my hands are so soft! Good-bye to dry, itchy hands. A must buy if you have the same issues with your skin. I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> For really irritated hands, Aveeno Hand Cream Intense Relief with Natural Colloidal Oatmeal is IT! My hands have actually been so dry that the skin was cracked and hand washing and drying was torture. THIS PRODUCT was the solution. No other hand cream on the market can match it&#x27;s ability to protect so well that the skin can begin to heal. There is no perfume or medicinal smell. Works like magic!</li>
    <li> This is a great hand cream, probably my favorite. It leaves hands supple and not greasy. It lasts through the work day even if you wash your hands often, but definitely not 24 hours.  This is a must for winter.</li>
    <li> The one I received is half empty, and it is not sealed! When I pushed the tube, some drops of liquid came off! Although the rest is fine, I feel very disgusted! It is definitely used! I will never purchase beauty and health product from amazon any more!</li>
    <li> In the winter, my hands always get super dried out from tying my laces. This is extremely painful. However, the Aveeno Hand Cream is like a protective glove. Also, it really does last for a very long time! (I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily say it lasts all day, as it claims, but it is by far superior to all other \\&quot;Intense relieve hand creams\\&quot; that I&#x27;ve used)</li>
    <li> As a preschool teacher i wash my hand at least a hundred times a day. my hands were cracked from so much hand washing. After a few days of using the Aveeno hand cream my hands were completely healed.Its worth every single cents i spent.</li>
    <li> Non greasy and deep moisturizing and healing for winter hands.</li>
    <li> It was exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> Leaves hands soft.  Non greasy.</li>
    <li> I brought it last year, and reordered it last month.I love it very much, because it moistens my hands skin well, and not oil.</li>
    <li> The one I received was only half full.  And there was no seal inside the lid.  I could not tell if someone else had already used it.</li>
    <li> Great Aveeno quality. Relieves dry sore cracked hands.</li>
    <li> Formula feels thin and watery on my hands. Not deeply moisturizing and certainly does not feel moisturized hours later. My search continues but EOS brand seems better. I will not reorder.</li>
    <li> This hand cream is great! It leaves hands supple and not greasy. It lasts through the work day even if you wash your hands often. This is a must have for winter. Worth the money!</li>
    <li> I ADORE this product but only gave it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t think it lasts 24 hours through hand washes. It absorbs instantly and you don&#x27;t need very much. It has NO scent (so my hubby can use it too- and no one will know!) and makes Me feel Indulgent when I use it! It does last a LOT longer than any other hand/body lotions(including other Aveeno products)I&#x27;ve ever used and I must say, It&#x27;s my favorite! I&#x27;d give it 5 stars for that alone but I wanted to make sure people were not really expecting it to last through hand washings.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this item about a week ago after giving up my beloved Neutrogena norwegian formula due to it&#x27;s paraben laden ingredients, glad to say this one it&#x27;s definitely working for me! not sure that it moisturizes for 24 hours, then again I wash my hands a lot! but so far so good!</li>
    <li> My hands are getting all dry and chappy on me, so I buy this cream and things are already picking up. My hands are losing their crusty feel and are becoming oh so smooth. Sick move of mine to get this!!</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hands. It isn&#x27;t creamy at all. It just goes on and disappears right away. I don&#x27;t like and will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not being paid to write this, but this review will read as if I am. Excellent, soothing, healing cream. Not sticky or smelly. I&#x27;ve tried various hand lotions for years and this is about the best, even compared to expensive products. I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> There really isn&#x27;t anything special about this lotion.  It is moisturizing but if I go to wash my hands (which is often since I have a two month old daughter) I definitely need to re-apply the lotion afterwards.  This isn&#x27;t a problem because I don&#x27;t expect any lotion to last through a handwashing but since it is advertised as being long-lasting even through handwashings, I feel I do need to take a star off.  The price isn&#x27;t bad for what you get, but I will probably not re-order this particular brand and try something else that really might be more long-lasting.</li>
    <li> All their products are super, and this hand cream is especially long-lansting. My hands are in and out of water all day, and Intense Relief lasts through a good part of the day for me. I don&#x27;t have to reapply it constantly, and that is a great time (and money) saver.</li>
    <li> I used the best hand cream, wash your hands after using it, hands become moist, soft, very good product I used the best hand cream, wash your hands after using it, hands become moist, soft, very good product</li>
    <li> This is wonderful hand cream ..I have been using this since two years almost every day...it hydrates chapped hands and absorbs quickly ...</li>
    <li> I love that I can use this lotion and them immediately work on my computer without leaving grease all over it.  I haven&#x27;t found anything that can protect and repair dry winter hands better that isn&#x27;t a greasy mess.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Really nice moisturizing hand lotion.  Perfect for desk or night stand!  Not greasy and stays on even after hand washing! (somewhat!)</li>
    <li> This is good for a daily hand cream when you wash your hands frequently throughout the day and it moisturizers without being greasy or oily.</li>
    <li> It has a very light flavor, easy to absorb</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a Great hand lotion.</li>
    <li> Very nice for dry hands.</li>
    <li> i think this hand cream is good bc it lasts at least through one hand-wash. i was using this cream for about a year before it started loosing its effectiveness and thus i began a new search for the perfect hand cream.  but i liked it while it lasted.</li>
    <li> This lotion is a life saver! My hands get very dry after handwashing, and most other lotions I&#x27;ve bought are either too greasy/oily, have too much perfume, only moisturize for an hour or so, or doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin. The Aveeno hand cream is the complete opposite...my hands soak it up like water and the after-effect is just extremely soft, relieved hands. And yes, your hands are still a bit moisturized after handwashing.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a great product that will seem to cure skin problems on your hands, search no more. SIMPLY THE BEST.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion for my hands! I put this on every night when I am going to bed and I wake up with soft, moisturized hands. This is also great for dry elbows as well. It smells nice and the smell is not overpowering. This is great for anyone who has dry hands from being in a cold climate or constantly washing your hands. I found this to be a life saver after having constantly dried out hands from changing diapers and washing my hands a million times a day.</li>
    <li> After chemo, my skin was so dry it hurt.  My daughter found this on Amazon along with some wonderful night time gloves.  I rubbed the cream in, put on the gloves and the very next morning, my hands were soft and pain free.  I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Works great, is gentle, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy after film.</li>
    <li> My hands always feel dry and tight after my morning routine, particularly once I&#x27;ve washed them with soap post-hair-styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used lotions and creams in the past to combat this, and although many of them work fine in that regard, they always have some deficit that ruins the experience.  Some are oily/greasy, others don&#x27;t absorb very well and I&#x27;m stuck wiping some of it off so I can make it out of the house (blasted door knobs!).  Others have a pungent or overpowering odor...even some of the fragrance free products have had an unfortunate smell despite having no fragrance added (which would have at least masked the chemical-like scent).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this stuff hits all the right marks.  A small amount goes a long way and leaves my hands feeling relieved and moisturized.  It&#x27;s not greasy or oily, &amp;#34;soaks in&amp;#34; pretty quickly, and there&#x27;s no odor to be found, foul or otherwise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even better is the price.  Because you need so little of the product to accomplish the task, this will last you (or at least it lasts me) MONTHS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really can&#x27;t say enough about this product, its high quality, and the great value.</li>
    <li> I have used many Aveeno products over the years.  They aren&#x27;t the best of the best, but value-wise I think they can&#x27;t be beat.  I mean you can pay four times as much for some crazy natural skin care products made in Europe out of Unicorns or something, but if you just need some good lotion, Aveeno is my go-to.  I work in the service industry and have to wash my hands a lot and use instant hand sanitizer too, which dries them out further.  I use this lotion once in the morning and once at night and have no problems with excessive dryness.</li>
    <li> Soaks into skin well and feels good.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist, it&#x27;s the best.  And Amazon&#x27;s prices are the best for this product.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> This hand cream is a good healing hand cream.  I have my hands in water much too much, and this is a good choice for daily use.</li>
    <li> I use this multiple times a day. It does not leave a greasy feeling like many other lotions I have tried.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to a friend!</li>
    <li> So many lotions leave some perfume smell or are greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This slightly moistens my hands but after a few minutes they feel normal again.</li>
    <li> I tend to have dry hands in the morning and this moisturizes without making my hands feel greasy. It doesn&#x27;t seem to last too long, but then again I don&#x27;t use the whole bottle at one time.</li>
    <li> Perfect for dry winter skin; helped to bring relief almost immediately. No greasy feel, just plain relief. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance to it, either.</li>
    <li> This is the one I&#x27;ve been looking for!!  Fragrance free, doesn&#x27;t leave my hands greasy, soothes my cracked fingers, and isn&#x27;t expensive!  I bought two, and will probably order a third one to throw in the car.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I&#x27;m really bad at using hand lotion.  I never remember to put in on, even in the winter.  The only time I remember is after my hands are already red and cracked.  I came across this stuff a couple winters ago when my hands were in really bad shape.  After the first use, my hands were moisturized and no longer cracked.  What is also great about it is that it lasts through handwashing.  I use this once in the morning and it usually lasts the entire day. Great, great, great product.</li>
    <li> Fragrance free, dries fast and leaves the least greasy feel of all creams and really helps my dried out hands alot.  I&#x27;ve tried alot of creams and this is the best.</li>
    <li> This is, by far, my hands down favorite for hand care.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at my local drugstore because my hands are extremely rough and dry. This did not moisturize my hands for 24 hours, like the bottle says it does. After applying, I realized the hand cream wasn&#x27;t greasy, but it also wasn&#x27;t that moisturizing for my extremely rough and dry hands. It only lasted through hand washing if you don&#x27;t use soap. As an Aveeno lover, I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> I disappointed about this product. It is not worth for my money. I don&#x27;t like this product, never rebuy it!</li>
    <li> Delivery and packing were fine.  This Aveeno product is particularly helpful for dry skin.  From daily use it has improved my 67yo skin to looking like it did when I was 40.  It is not greasy and in my case absorbs quickly and does not stop working after each washing.  I use it on average 2x/day.  I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> This Aveeno hand cream is non greasy and really lasts for 24 hours. It is the only hand cream I have found that actually relieves and helps heal the itchy, cracked skin on my hands. Even our grown son, who is very adverse to greasy creams, but who suffers from very red, cracked hands, uses this product. This cream is very hard to find in stores and my son and I both order it from Amazon instead.</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion at a reasonable price that works on my hands.  I have hard water at home and at work so i was constantly applying lotion every time I washed my hands.  I was literally putting lotion on my hands around 15 times a day.  My friend is a hairdresser and recommended Aveeno to me since her hands are always in water.  I took her advice and I only have to reapply around 3 times a day.  The smell isn&#x27;t the greatest (I was hoping for the same smell as their nighttime eye cream) but it doesn&#x27;t smell awful, I guess the best way to describe the smell is plain.</li>
    <li> Very effective and not greasy. The only hand cream that quickly resolved my son&#x27;s dry skin problem.</li>
    <li> I used Aveeno on my kids when they were little for a variety of things, always came through for me. And this lotion is good, I say lotion because it isn&#x27;t that thick. No crazy fragrance, just good. Feels nice when you put it on. Does the job.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin. My hands get especially dry, but by using this product regularly I can keep my hands from getting too dry. I love that this product is not greasy.</li>
    <li> I am an Aveeno fan (buy for my children use -- lotion to shampoo, etc.)  This one, however, smells like plastic.  Usually when a product not in a glass container smells like plastic, it means either the sun has beaten on it and it loses its potential worth; or the product has sat too long on the counter; or both.  Few other products I have bought from Amazon, such as CeraVe foaming cleanser has also produce the same smell.  I need to be patient and try maybe another product which comes in similar packaging such as these former two and compare again if it actually has sat too long in storage and/or received too much light to begin deteriorating the effect of the ingredient.  Stay tuned.</li>
    <li> the smell is a little bad</li>
    <li> No fragrance, very moisturizing, non-greasy.  Best hand lotion I have used and I have really dry hands due to dishwashing and cold weather.</li>
    <li> Happy with this item. Works great, looks great, and seems to be of good quality.</li>
    <li> My hand needed a lotion that would not get all over me.  I knit a lot and that dries my hands so it is great.</li>
    <li> There was no seal on the hand cream tube and it seems like portion on the tube was used. Disappointing, will buy elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic hand cream that I&#x27;ve used for several years.  Great for in the office to prevent paper cuts, etc.  The scent is very light, and it dries quickly leaving no grease on your hands.</li>
    <li> excellent product I recommend it.</li>
    <li> It is non-greasy and it moisturizes well.  Having said that, the claim that it lasts through hand washings depends on what classifies as a hand washing to you.  If you just rinse with water, it will last but if you lather up with soap it&#x27;s gone.  Have you ever made the mistake of trying to clean up a wax spill with a wet rag?  It&#x27;s really ineffective because the water doesn&#x27;t penetrate the wax... that&#x27;s how this behaves.  It has a very different feel than any other lotion I&#x27;ve tried.  I recommend trying it out in a store first and if you like it buy more online.</li>
    <li> I use Neutrogena for overnight hand care when my hands are beat up, but this is my daily hand lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs quickly, allowing me to use the computer, tools, etc. without fear of not being able to grasp stuff. And it works well. Not an havy duty cream, but it does the job a hand cream should do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I live in Colorado, and on most days the humidity is down in the teens (tomorrow it&#x27;s forecasted to be in the mid-single digits), so something that works quickly, allows me to keep working, and actually works is something I value.</li>
    <li> I fully expected to like this.  It does make my skin softer, but it creates a sort of film on my skin that then will sort of get gritty and rub off if I rub my hands.  It&#x27;s slightly waxy. It also seems to rub off on my clothing, which I can see if I&#x27;m wearing black or dark blue.  I wonder if it might actually be the \\&quot;oat kernel flour\\&quot; that does this? Colloidal oatmeal is a powder.  I&#x27;m not going to throw it out, but I&#x27;m not going to buy it again either. I bought this at a local drug store so I can&#x27;t comment on what others have said about the product having been opened or used, except to say that I don&#x27;t remember it being sealed in any way.</li>
    <li> its ok but kinda sticky</li>
    <li> the top of my hands were getting soooo dry b/c of the cold weather so i started using this again and it saved my skin from looking like the Sahara desert. i like this lotion, b/c it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all after you apply it.</li>
    <li> My hands were getting a bit dry from work, so I looked up this hand cream to try out. I love it! It doesn&#x27;t smell like much, and you just need a bit to get moisturized. Just leave it in for a half a minute or so, and your hands don&#x27;t feel oily at all unlike other lotions.</li>
    <li> Non greasy!  Works very well. I recommend this product. Has a very light fragrance which is acceptable. I use it before sleep and it moisturizes through the next day.</li>
