      <li>Then I have the perfect combination of quick application (this product) and high moisturization (the Lubriderm).</li>
      <li>it is light and non greasy and has a very light smell..</li>
      <li>I love how light and absorbent this lotion is.</li>
      <li>It has a lovely, light smell-almost like Lily of the Valley or Muget.</li>

      <li>Neutrogena Body Lotion, Light Sesame Formula, 8.5-Ounce Pump (Pack of 4)]]</li>
      <li>Neutrogena&#x27;s Light Sesame Formula is a light, non-greasy feeling lotion that dissapears once you rub it in.  </li>
      <li>Light and non-greasy.  </li>
      <li>This is a light but very effective moisturizer, and has a delicate fragrance.</li>
      <li>This is affordably priced, has sesame oil as the first or second ingredient-so that tells you that is what the lotion consists of the mostly!</li>
      <li>I apply this right before my make up.</li>
      <li>Fast absorbing, smells really nice, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>It is especially useful during the fall and winter months when dry skin can be a problem.</li>
      <li>So what I did i just added some essential oil with my favorite smell into it</li>
      <li>I first used a sample of this product on vacation at a hotel.</li>
      <li>Love the smell especially!!</li>
      <li>I think the sesame oil is the secret here because I&#x27;ve tried many lotions and this one is by far the best I&#x27;ve found for a general body lotion.  </li>
      <li>Loved it so much I tracked it down and ordered it on Amazon since I could not find in stores.</li>
      <li>Think of a cool breeze blowing the *mild* scent of the Coppertone on the person next to you at the beach</li>
      <li>Love the consistency and the this particular lotion and have for a long time!</li>
      <li>Perfect when you don&#x27;t want a heavy residue or heavy scent lotion.  </li>
      <li>I only wish a gallon size would be made available.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s no longer available here locally in Tulsa, so I buy it for her through Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Really helps make for an even surface.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly and is not too heavily fragranced so that it bothers my allergis.</li>
      <li>Body lotion is superior to hand lotion because you get more of it for the same purpose, so it isn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
      <li>IT IS LIGHT WEIGHT WITH A REAL SILKY FEEL AND HAS A VERY FAINT PLEASANT FRAGRANCE.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very fresh and mild and brings back summertime memories all year long.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>absorbs well and is high quality-</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product as it keeps my skin soft as well!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky at all after you put it on, yet skin feels so soft.</li>
      <li>I could not get it at the stores near me, so I ordered from Amazon.</li>
      <li>Your skin feels soft and clean rather than covered in a heavy lotion.  </li>
      <li>What I do is mix it with a bit of the very thick, very moisturizing Lubriderm that comes in a tub and doesn&#x27;t spread easily.  </li>
      <li>Light non-greasy formula, moisturizes without all the heavy oily feel!</li>
      <li>The sesame oil makes it light, and the fragrance is clean.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been hard to find at Target the last couple of years.</li>
      <li>I can tell you quite confidently that this scent smells vaguely of the old Coppertone sunscreen you used to put on at the beach when you were a kid.</li>

    <li> Love the consistency and the this particular lotion and have for a long time!</li>
    <li> I always get this in a sample size bottle at any hotel I go to. I hope this is the same. I apply this right before my make up. I love it, because its not oily and it&#x27;s very light weight. I didn&#x27;t see this in Walmart.</li>
    <li> I love how light and absorbent this lotion is. It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky at all after you put it on, yet skin feels so soft.

    <li> I have exceedingly thin skin on my arms and very dry skin on my legs.  I have tried so many lotions that I have lost count.  This product is the very best that I have used.  I will continue to use this product and recommend it to others.  I shared this information with my dermatologist.  Sara Reale</li>
    <li> Neutrogena&#x27;s Body Lotion (light sesame)smells and feels great.  I only wish a gallon size would be made available.</li>
    <li> I first tried this while staying at a hotel, and fell in love with the light, lovely scent.  Couldn&#x27;t find it locally, so ordered it online.  It&#x27;s the same wonderful product.  Great job, Neutrogena!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS LOTION!  IT IS LIGHT WEIGHT WITH A REAL SILKY FEEL AND HAS A VERY FAINT PLEASANT FRAGRANCE.</li>
    <li> This lotion has a pleasant light fragrance, is not sticky, has an attractive bottle and is very affordable!  What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> I first used a sample of this product on vacation at a hotel. I loved the smell so I searched for the product and found it on line. I am sickened by many lotion and perfume smells but not this one. It is pleasant and light and a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is great body lotion...I use it regularly and often. I highly recommend this product. It is some of the best I have used.</li>
    <li> Awesome lotion. I went to Mexico last summer and got a trial size bottle at our hotel. Loved it immediately and when I got home found out I could not get it at the stores near me, so I ordered from Amazon. Love the product.</li>
    <li> Great seller, excellent product, fast delivery. Would reorder.</li>
    <li> Nothing matches the moisturizing capability and scent of this body lotion, according to my Mother.  It&#x27;s no longer available here locally in Tulsa, so I buy it for her through Amazon.  She&#x27;s constantly afraid they will \\&quot;improve\\&quot; or even discontinue it.  Hopefully, they will leave it as is and make lots more of it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the bomb</li>
    <li> Out of every body lotion I have used, this remains my favorite!  I use it every day and it does not feel oily and has a light beautiful scent.  I would highly recommend this product as it keeps my skin soft as well!</li>
    <li> Really great product and the shipping was on time.</li>
    <li> Purchased this and had never used it before, now i will not use anything else. it is light and non greasy and has a very light smell..it will be great for the summer...and the delivery was fast and packaged well also...</li>
    <li> I received this lotion from a hotel while on a trip. Loved it so much I tracked it down and ordered it on Amazon since I could not find in stores. The lotion is great and does not leave a sticky feeling, the smell is very light and fresh.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lotion and was sorry to see that it&#x27;s no longer carried in the grocery stores or local CVS or Walgreens.  I buy it in bulk all the time on Amazon and it&#x27;s great.  Fast absorbing, smells really nice, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin.  Don&#x27;t ever discontinue this product!!</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Body Lotion, Light Sesame Formula is an excellent product. It goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly and is not too heavily fragranced so that it bothers my allergis.</li>
    <li> absorbs well and is high quality- small bottle for the price, but brand does meet a higher expectation so understood</li>
    <li> SCENT:  It&#x27;s one thing to review how the moisturizers work in a lotion product, but the difficult part is to describe to a reader the scent that they will smell when receiving it. I can tell you quite confidently that this scent smells vaguely of the old Coppertone sunscreen you used to put on at the beach when you were a kid. It&#x27;s very fresh and mild and brings back summertime memories all year long. When I read \\&quot;Sesame Oil\\&quot; I instinctively think of Thai noodles or some asian cuisine. This scent is nothing like that. Think of a cool breeze blowing the *mild* scent of the Coppertone on the person next to you at the beach and you have an idea of what it will smell like on.    SIZE:  I bought my really big container (32 FL OZ; 1 QT) at the Target store for about fifteen doll (they no longer carry it). I have very dry skin and use it about every other day, all year long and this size lasts me approximately 9 months. In other words, this 8.5 oz bottle would last me just a few months. So, if you have dry skin you might want to either find a larger bottle or stock up.

    <li> Neutrogena&#x27;s Light Sesame Formula is a light, non-greasy feeling lotion that dissapears once you rub it in.  Your skin feels soft and clean rather than covered in a heavy lotion.  I prefer to use it on my face as I have sensative and slightly oily skin.</li>
    <li> Perfect when you don&#x27;t want a heavy residue or heavy scent lotion.  I like to use this underneath my tanning lotion.  Really helps make for an even surface.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have used this lotion for years. The sesame oil makes it light, and the fragrance is clean.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been hard to find at Target the last couple of years.</li>
    <li> This lotion has a wonderful, very light aroma, as advertised.  It also goes on very smooth.  However, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it as a moisturizer.  In fact, it dries my hands.  What I do is mix it with a bit of the very thick, very moisturizing Lubriderm that comes in a tub and doesn&#x27;t spread easily.  Then I have the perfect combination of quick application (this product) and high moisturization (the Lubriderm).</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!! Its my favorite!! Love the smell especially!! Its Amazing!! Goes on light and isnt greasy!! Its defiantly my go too!</li>
    <li> Great! Body lotion is superior to hand lotion because you get more of it for the same purpose, so it isn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
    <li> A good friend who lives in the desert of Palm Springs turned me on to this moisurizing lotion.  It is very hard to find in the stores so I order it online.  It does amazing things to your skin and it is non greasy.  I think the sesame oil is the secret here because I&#x27;ve tried many lotions and this one is by far the best I&#x27;ve found for a general body lotion.  Very lightly scented.</li>
    <li> I discovered this lotion when on a business trip. The hotel had a bottle as part of their complementary toiletries. I have had a very difficult time finding a local store that carries the lotion. Thank you Amazon!!! This is a light but very effective moisturizer, and has a delicate fragrance.</li>
    <li> Great lotion! The size bottle is perfect, too!  The smell does not last long (I don&#x27;t like lotions with a scent). Glad I bought this!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this in stores - had it in a mini hotel size bottle and searched all over for it. My daughter-in-law suggested Amazon and viola! There it was. Light non-greasy formula, moisturizes without all the heavy oily feel! Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Light and non-greasy.  Love it!</li>
