      <li>this lotion feels amazing.</li>
      <li>Amazing...</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t something you would use in warm months.</li>
      <li>Even SPF 15 would have been nice.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells good too :)</li>
      <li>It makes your skin softer and does kind of even it out, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything for your acne, helps in absoloutly no way</li>
      <li>This is one of the best this I&#x27;ve tried, It just a week much clearer skin.</li>
      <li>I always use it many times a day and get good results.</li>
      <li>i love this stuff..plus the price is good...</li>
      <li>so i decided to go to the CVS and get something nice for myself.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really the perfect balance for temperamental skin like mine.</li>
      <li>Absolutely thrilled.</li>
      <li>Excellent product..can&#x27;t live without it</li>
      <li>but i live in a warmer place so this is perfect!</li>
      <li>Aveeno products are the best, and this one works very well on many skin types.</li>
      <li>Always love using Aveeno products and it&#x27;s doing me even greater good as it is winter.</li>
      <li>but honestly this is so much better.</li>
      <li>This is the best moisturiser so far for me.</li>
      <li>This is the best moisturizer for me so far.</li>
      <li>product is amazing and is much better than what I was using.</li>
      <li>Would recommend you find another moisturizer and just use the cleanser because it&#x27;s actually a really effective product unlike this which may also give you breakouts in trade for better complexion</li>
      <li>It clears up my acne, moisturizes my face, and makes it looks even, clear, and wonderful.</li>
      <li>Aveeno Clear Complexion works great!</li>
      <li>a good moisturizer is important.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to see if it would work that i put it on in my car, and even then i could feel it was good for my skin.</li>
      <li>was so happy when I first tried this.</li>
      <li>Very light.</li>
      <li>Very light, not greasy.  </li>
      <li>Works well on all types of skin, is not oily and has a very light scent.</li>
      <li>but the lotion is very light weight and not oily.</li>
      <li>Very light and non-greasy feeling.  </li>
      <li>i used this before and it&#x27;s very light</li>
      <li>I love the foaming cleanser, but not the case with this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I also love the lotion but wish it had some spf.</li>
      <li>this does the trick while also helping my skin to look more even.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the feel and smell of this moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>Did I mention that it&#x27;s oil free?!?  </li>

      <li>I love the stuff.</li>

      <li>My favorite moisturizer of all time.  </li>
      <li>and you&#x27;re looking for a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin and feels more \\&quot;lotiony\\&quot; (vs. hydrating)</li>
      <li>It also contains soy, which is shown to help reduce scarring after blemishes, which is perfect for a teen, like myself.</li>
      <li>and of course there is more in the package.</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>My complexion is better after using it for a month.  </li>
      <li>My tone is more even</li>
      <li>and sometimes I will even go to town with no make-up because I feel confident without it.  </li>
      <li>stopped using it all together because my face seems to do alot better when using Proactiv, so i dont know what it is..</li>
      <li>, no breakouts and my skin looks more even toned.  </li>
      <li>Love the feel of this cream.</li>
      <li>and I love this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many face lotions but seems like I have to apply more than once to get the effect that I like.</li>
      <li>This order always arrives literally 2 days after I buy it, and I am in love with how this moisturizer makes my skin feel.</li>
      <li>and I must say this is one of the better moisturizers I&#x27;ve come across.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>This is the only moisturizer that I will use as it is the perfect balance of moisture and thickness.</li>

      <li>, I love Aveeno&#x27;s products.</li>
      <li>Nothing works better for my skin then this.</li>
      <li>soooooo glad to have found this</li>
      <li>I absolutely love aveeno products.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s liquid magic.</li>
      <li>and I can apply foundation on top of it</li>
      <li>I love that I can use both products twice a day and not have to worry about my skin drying out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m able to use that doesn&#x27;t cause pimples</li>
      <li>i LOVE this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Any more that one squirt</li>
      <li>Love how it feels and smell.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still not quite sure why my skin reacted like this</li>
      <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I think that Neutrogena is a better product.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>This is the best moisturizer I’ve ever tried and works amazingly for me (although there is certainly no guarantee it will work for everyone).  </li>
      <li>and so far so good!  </li>
      <li>So far, so good!</li>
      <li>It leaves a nice clean feeling on my face.  </li>
      <li>It is easy absorbing, and has a great scent.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff, great for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Works great to clear blemishes</li>
      <li>They work great for my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>The lotion itself is a great moisturizer and is not heavy at all.</li>
      <li>/&gt;We are so happy to have clear</li>
      <li>Most importantly it breaks me out.</li>
      <li>Works great for my acne prone sensitive skin .</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m good for the whole day.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone with mild acne issues or infrequent break-outs, and to anyone who just wants a great moisturizer.</li>
      <li>it was nice, but didn&#x27;t have the right amount of acne medication for me.</li>
      <li>LoL) to see if it would work better than Proactiv which i am currently using... I was also looking for a cheaper alternative than Proactiv.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this product, and with Amazons low prices its a great buy.</li>
      <li>I used to be acne and pimple free till I was about 18 years old; then the outbreaks started happening lol.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was really happy when i put on the product because my face felt really soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure the 0.5 Salicylic Acid is good for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>no need to overdo as it spreads easily across your face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also like that this product has a very mild scent.</li>
      <li>It does a good job moisturizing for the whole day, while still being a light formula.</li>
      <li>For makeup, aveeno creates a very smooth canvas for foundation and absorbs the makeup quite quickly.</li>
      <li>Other than that, this is my favorite drugstore moisturizer!!!</li>
      <li>My daughter spends a lot of money on acne products and I&#x27;m a huge fan of Aveeno brand.  </li>
      <li>&quot; My skin is smooth and even.</li>
      <li>This is so light and not greasy at all.</li>
      <li>Light smell.  </li>
      <li>This product will do wonders at keeping your skin blemish free.</li>
      <li>After use of this moisturizer, my face becomes really smooth</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s the Aveeno brand, they are great with my skin type, which is why I keep coming back to them.</li>
      <li>The moisturizer is the perfect amount of moisturizing without feeling too heavy.  </li>
      <li>although this product really helped me see a difference, it now seems like my face has kind of gotten used to it</li>
      <li>It also smells very neutral, but nice.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth.  </li>
      <li>This is a great facial moisturizer and blemish fighter.</li>
      <li>Someone actually commented how great my face looked.</li>
      <li>I like this moisturizer because it&#x27;s light and helps with the complexion, it also has SPF and protects the sun.</li>
      <li>moisturizer is great as it keep my facial skin moist and keeps my acne somewhat under control.</li>
      <li>Use it everyday and the price is perfect for the product that you get!</li>
      <li>I have always loved Aveeno&#x27;s clear complexion line.  </li>
      <li>Been using it for a couple of weeks and so far it&#x27;s good 👍</li>
      <li>My face is so soft and clear and just great!</li>
      <li>We just don&#x27;t go back because even though the quality makes the price fair, it needs to do more to make the price payable.</li>
      <li>The cream has a light, clean consistency that applies smoothly and doesn&#x27;t clog pours.</li>
      <li>The product is very smooth and gentle, and absorbs very quickly.</li>
      <li>Either way, its worth trying!</li>
      <li>My skin has cleared significantly from this product.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s while worth it!</li>
      <li>Will buy again - it&#x27;s definitely worth the money!</li>
      <li>With both the Aveeno scrub and this lotion my skin (on my face) has been very healthy and soft.</li>
      <li>The scent is clean and not overbearing.</li>
      <li>Now my face looks and feels super smooth.</li>
      <li>Nothing I found made my face feel clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I am very happy so far.. bought this for my teenage daughter.  </li>
      <li>Also love the Positively Radiant moisturizer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK when my face absorbed it but gets oily very fast.</li>
      <li>product is very affordable and I love that it is 4 oz.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Good enough for me!</li>
      <li>It really evened out my skin tone (though it still has a way to go, I try to be thankful for how much better</li>
      <li>Not greasy, feels light, smells fresh.</li>
      <li>but then my face full of pimple and blackheads...</li>
      <li>I love this face wash so much.</li>
      <li>I honestly bought it because it said clear complexion</li>
      <li>So that bottle will last a good while.</li>
      <li>My face is naturally really dry and this lotion is absolutely perfect for me and my sister who&#x27;s face is naturally greasy.</li>
      <li>I goes on really smooth and soaks right into your face with no oily residue or sticky feeling</li>
      <li>Was fine at first</li>
      <li>I will be back to order more and more</li>
      <li>I use it at night before bed after washing my face with Cetaphil and in the morning after a quick rinse off of my face</li>
      <li>This is a great everyday light moisturizer for acne prone teens.  </li>
      <li>This is still moisturizing but also has help with mild pimples or bumps.  </li>
      <li>I have mild acne w. Flare UPS on my chin area.</li>
      <li>Great for my skin, soft scent and makes my face so soft.</li>
      <li>I love Aveeno facial care products because they are gentle and effective in fading scars and evening out my skin tone.</li>
      <li>This worked better then clean &amp; clear, and proactiv.</li>
      <li>I have tried many more expensive products but this works the best to keep my skin clear, without drying it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if they just have great B2B marketing or what, but I really enjoy this product.</li>
      <li>It dissolves quickly, and the scent is not too powerful.</li>
      <li>I have used dozens of products, the cheapo and the good stuff, and I found one may help some of the dry skin but by the end of the day I&#x27;d end up with a whitehead somewhere on my face.</li>
      <li>but my skin is pretty clear although it does have its own bumps here and there.</li>
      <li>While this product will work if I&#x27;m in a pinch, I&#x27;d rather shell out a little more cash for the Origins brand moisturizer and get some more bang for my buck!</li>
      <li>First lotion I have used that didn&#x27;t clog my pores!</li>
      <li>I use it daily, sometimes twice a day, I just love the way it feels!</li>
      <li>A great sunscreen year round to protect and moisturize your skin.</li>
      <li>It works fairly well for me, but I have better results from Origins and their products aren&#x27;t that much more expensive.</li>
      <li>Smells fresh.</li>
      <li>I love my skin now because it is so soft and my problem areas have faded away.</li>
      <li>It works even better with the Aveeno Clear Complexion scrub.  </li>
      <li>worth the price.</li>
      <li>but with delivery charges, the savings wasn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
      <li>and i rarely EVER break out.</li>
      <li>I love it more than any other product I use.</li>
      <li>It feels good, smells good, and my skin in less dry.  </li>
      <li>I always thought washing my skin too much would dry it out, but it&#x27;s just fine, and most importantly - pimple-free.</li>
      <li>I like this face lotion because it goes on smooth, no heavy, oily or watery feeling, and it feels just right!</li>
      <li>It helps to keep my complexion good and fade away some dark spots.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best moisturizer that I&#x27;ve tried on my skin, which is pretty dry and sensitive but was very oily in high school.</li>
      <li>I have a sensitive oily skin that breaks out easily.</li>
      <li>I added this product to my skincare regimen hoping that I had finally found a good moisturizer for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>After finding the Aveeno scrub I mentioned (in another review) how it can dry out your skin without some kind of face moisturizer.</li>
      <li>The moisturizer is fast absorbing, makes ur skin smooth and even.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and is absorbed quickly with no shine after application or hours later.  </li>
      <li>its good, a little drying to skin, but won&#x27;t cause breakouts</li>
      <li>This second Aveeno product did not let me down at all.&lt;br /&gt;It is a very good moisturizer for the face.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I finally came across this product.</li>
      <li>While first using the moisturizer, I broke out for about a week</li>
      <li>This is the only moisturizer I have been able to find that doesn&#x27;t cause my face to break out, yet keeps it moist.</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;d think this (being a heavier moisturizer) would be great but instead of hydrating the skin, it just leaves a thick layer of grease...feels \\&quot;gooey\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>But I have been known to breakout if a product even looks at me funny.</li>
      <li>This daily moisturizer works EVEN BETTER than the Skin Correcting Treatment</li>
      <li>I am on my 3rd bottle now and still love it.  </li>
      <li>I had faith in Aveeno because i love their lotion and decided to try this facial moisturizer (after spending like a hour in walmart trying to decide!</li>
      <li>At first my skin cleared up after using it.</li>
      <li>To combat these, I’ve tried many different moisturizers/topical treatments.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and not heavy.  </li>
      <li>I am an 18 yr/old female with oily skin, and I use this every night and most mornings, too.  </li>
      <li>which was the first thing I noticed.</li>
      <li>I use as a night cream because there is no spf and must use consistently to see improvement.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never used many products to improve my skin, but I will definitely keep this in my stash</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d be very upset if this product was discontinued!</li>
      <li>I first started using this moisturizer after a road trip...</li>
      <li>I bought this product because I was so in love with the Aveeno Daily Moisturizer Stress Relief with Lavender.</li>
      <li>, I use it daily under my makeup and really love it.</li>
      <li>For the price it is ten times better then name brand moisturizers and there is no perfumie scent added or nothing</li>
      <li>Love it,  had been using this stuff for years,  only moisturizer I will use.</li>
      <li>and if I wash my face and forget to put my moisturizer on, I can really feel the difference!  </li>
      <li>now I notice my face clear,fair tone,no more acne,or even tiny bump...</li>
      <li>I have used so many products and finally gave up.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft and light, but balances my skin&#x27;s oily/dry complexion and prevents acne.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and still keeps it smooth and hydrated even in the winter months.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing too!</li>
      <li>I love this facial moisturizer.</li>
      <li>likely this with combo of new face wash)&lt;br /&gt;recommended, &amp; love that it doesnt smell too strong, like many other acne meds</li>
      <li>The entire Aveeno Clear Complexion line is amazing.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what it is, but whenever I put this lotion on at night, I wake up with clear, clean, matte skin.</li>
      <li>Wow, I have tried so many moisturizers to help control my adult acne.</li>
      <li>My skin feels soft and smooth for the whole day.</li>
      <li>I liked the idea of having a facial moisturizer that would also help keep my skin clear...</li>
      <li>I tried the Aveeno Positively Radiant Skin with SPF 15</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this does anything for taking away zits or blemishes, but it is a good moisturizer that I don&#x27;t worry about clogging my pores (maybe I should, but I don&#x27;t seem to get breakouts when I use it).</li>
      <li>a friend had given me a small sample of this before, and I could never find it in stores, found it here on Amazon, and it came in shorter time than expected and it&#x27;s great!</li>
      <li>I have struggled with chronic acne for years, and I&#x27;ve come to learn that high quality moisturizers are just as important as powerful topical treatments.</li>
      <li>It has certainly helped my blemished skin.</li>
      <li>Have a large one on side of cheek that didn&#x27;t change at all.</li>
      <li>I would certainly have continued using the product if it weren&#x27;t for the fact that it just didn&#x27;t agree with my skin.</li>
      <li>my holy grale!! can&#x27;t live without it !!</li>
      <li>, i just look for products to cure the dark spots and blemishes on my face mostly to even out my skintone and bring out the beautiful brown that i know i have somewhere deep down inside &#x3D;-)</li>
      <li>The price is affordable here, and in general, compared to other lotions that are of good quality.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my face oil free for at least 6 hours and more depending on the weather and activity.</li>
      <li>I get very oily around my t zone and i have huge pores that you can actually see from a mile away</li>
      <li>This really is a life saving product line.</li>
      <li>BUT NOTHING REALLY WORKED.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say that it helps with the acne as much as I&#x27;d like it to, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a fault with the product itself; just need to find what works for me.</li>
      <li>I have combination skin that can get really oily, and I think this moisturizer works very well for my skin type.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle product by any stretch, but I really like the Aveeno moisturizer.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t really have ACNE</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that my makeup goes on much smoother than it did before.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I am AMAZED at how fast and how well this moisturizer worked.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>Oh well, I really wanted to believe Jennifer Anniston.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily on my t-zone area and moisturizes just enough to feel smooth on face.  </li>
      <li>I’ve had acne my whole life.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;But what I&#x27;d really like to say about this product is that it seems to help acne.</li>
      <li>Bought this again, and now my face is so much clearer.</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin and suffer from some breakouts.</li>
      <li>I switched to this product when I noticed the Neutrogena Moisturizer wasn&#x27;t reducing the jawline acne as much as I wanted</li>
      <li>I think this product works really well for what it says it</li>
      <li>&amp; I didn&#x27;t think it was really making a difference for my skin.</li>
      <li>Benzoyl peroxide dries skin too much to be used</li>
      <li>I really think it was the soy that helped even out my skin tone and get rid of redness.</li>
      <li>I do still really like this stuff, though.</li>
      <li>I brought this as a last resort because I was waiting for an oil free moisturizer in the mail.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, i found aveeno face scrub wash worked really well with my skin, and decided to give this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Highly Recommend!</li>
      <li>and you have too much.</li>
      <li>It is very moisturizing and the salicylic acid is an added bonus.</li>
      <li>I really love the aveeno clear complexion facial cleanser,  </li>
      <li>Good moisturizer, not too thick.</li>
      <li>B000052YJM Clean &amp; Clear ESSENTIALS Dual Action Moisturizer, 4 Ounce]]).</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no such a thing called purging when using facial products over the counter so please be aware when a product make you break out more.</li>
      <li>but it still helps more than other moisturizers.</li>
      <li>Combined with some other moisturizers, I have found a decent balance for my skin, so I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
      <li>She really loves it and highly recommends it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended from someone very picky with face creams.</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin kind of dry and red</li>
      <li>Aveen Clear Complexion is the first moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used, and I have to say it did not disappoint.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogeno Oil Free Moisturizer for Combination Skin for the last few years, when I ran out of my latest bottle</li>
      <li>Cystic acne is not fun to deal with and this brought out too many cysts around my chin and cheeks.  </li>
      <li>Also, I am usually pretty sensitive to Salicylic Acid but for some reason it doesn&#x27;t bother me with this lotion.</li>
      <li>Eventually with 5-7 new break outs a day!</li>
      <li>Overall, no matter how many moisturizers I try, I always go back to this one.</li>
      <li>Yes, better than the most expensive name brands.  </li>
      <li>It really makes your skin look even and clear!</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
      <li>never had problem skin in high school, but once I hit college</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>many moisturizers have a little bit of sun protection.  </li>
      <li>It cost a little more then others</li>
      <li>This moisturizer in particular is amazing, and I usually can never find it in stores which is why I strictly have to order it on Amazon - which I am not complaining about!</li>
      <li>I am in my early 30s and have VERY finicky skin.</li>
      <li>so far I really like it.</li>
      <li>But for clear, healthy skin, it works just as well as much more expensive moisturizers I&#x27;ve been given by dermatologists.</li>
      <li>Before this, I had been using the neutrogena moisturizer for sensitive skin, which seemed to make my face really greasy.</li>
      <li>I feel it works better for my oily 35 year old skin than more expensive brand.</li>
      <li>But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product if you&#x27;re in the normal or oily category.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a pimple here and there that people normally get.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad i bought it a few months ago</li>
      <li>It is just a very simple basic face lotion that makes your skin soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>nice and thick moisturizer, but the cap gets stuck at times.</li>
      <li>It says it&#x27;s oil free, but that clearly can&#x27;t be the case because i have dry skin</li>
      <li>Many moisturizers I tried left my skin feeling dry hours after or caused breakouts, but not this one.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin due to rosacea and breakouts but this lotion has helped my skin get clear and feel smooth!</li>
      <li>I usually use Clean &amp; Clear salicylic daily moisturizer and this has proven to be just like it in that it doesn&#x27;t cause me to breakout but gives me more moisture.</li>
      <li>All in all, it&#x27;s a nice basic moisturizer for acne-prone skin, although it&#x27;s a little pricey.</li>
      <li>Salicylic acid has never been effective on my acne, and I don&#x27;t think the very small amount of salicylic acid in this product did anything for me.</li>
      <li>I have not seen any new pimple since I started using this.</li>
      <li>I thought I&#x27;d try something new.</li>
      <li>I take my time when adding a new product to my skincare routine so that I know if its going to break me out or not,</li>
      <li>I do have been having new blemishes while using this product</li>
      <li>It don&#x27;t look like new to me.</li>
      <li>Perfect for cold days when my face skin was starting to peel :</li>
      <li>Light daily moisturizer that provides just enough moisture without making your skin appear oily anytime of day!</li>
      <li>My skin is very sensitive to allergens and is also acne prone.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>This product is very natural and calming.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin with some oily spots and acne..</li>
      <li>My skin is very soft and looks amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>i have very sensitive skin, this doesn&#x27;t upset my skin.</li>
      <li>Compared to neutrogena moisturizers, this feels so light and not greasy at all even if i stay  outside for a long time.</li>
      <li>It absorbs very quickly and does not feel heavy or oily.</li>
      <li>Will probably go back to Positively Radiant line.</li>
      <li>Never left my skin too oily, and slight change in complexion for the better.</li>
      <li>So if you have sensitive, dry skin this is definitely worth trying.</li>
      <li>use this moisturizer with the Aveeno Clear Complexion Bar.</li>
      <li>it didnt clear my face up..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Aveeno Clear Complexion Moisturizer for over a year now</li>
      <li>I have problematic skin with blemishes and this product has helped clear my completion.</li>
      <li>I was using Eminence Clear Skin Probiotic Moisturizer ($35/2 oz)</li>
      <li>Our late teens and early 20 somethings love this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>My skin was relatively clear except for some acne on my jawline.</li>
      <li>Then I switched to the \\&quot;Clear</li>
      <li>this product and the soap clear complexion..</li>
      <li>I use the clear complexion face wash as well.</li>
      <li>It helps keep my skin clear and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin either.</li>
      <li>Works so well on my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>so far no breakouts</li>
      <li>I am a 21 years old college student suffering from acne since about 9 years old.</li>
      <li>AND MY FACE IS DARN NEAR CLEAR.</li>
      <li>Of course, for modest to aggressive acne I suggest a prescription product like Retin-A</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 38 years old</li>
      <li>It makes your skin so soft but</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Not as fast acting as I wanted.</li>
      <li>My skin type: sensitive and on the oily side.</li>
      <li>It really makes a difference especially in Cali where are weather is bi-polar</li>
      <li>the next haha.</li>
      <li>12 year old son has been using it as well, and the pimples are almost all</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin that has all kinds of issues.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve found this product to be gentle enough to apply every day and night for maintenance.</li>
      <li>so far it hasn&#x27;t shown to be an issue in the breakout factor.</li>
      <li>really noticed a different in the redness.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Makes skin feel so soft.</li>
      <li>My skin is naturally oily and quite prone to acne.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really the only thing that works for me.</li>
      <li>my skin feels soft.</li>
      <li>leaves your face soft and smooth without a heavy oily feeling.</li>
      <li>However, sadly this stuff isn&#x27;t that good.</li>
      <li>I finally found a daily facial wash that worked well and didn&#x27;t completely dry out my skin (causing me to break out more!), but the combination of new skin wash and this moisturizer are what ultimately cleared up</li>
      <li>I have tried many drugstore products - neutrogena, olay, burt&#x27;s bee, etc - and even the more expensive brands such as proactive, dermalogica and some other brands from sephora but none has really worked.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t oily and it absorbs quickly into the skin, but still leaves your face feeling good for at least a few hours on a dry wintery day.</li>
      <li>i wash my face with aveeno soap,at first my face was so dry</li>
      <li>I love that a little goes a long way!</li>
      <li>Most of the positive reviews for this product are fake and just written by the sellers/ company themself.</li>
      <li>After several weeks using the product every morning along with the Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Cleansing Pads, I have seen no improvement in my skin&#x27;s clarity.</li>
      <li>This was the first face lotion I have ever used until it was absolutely empty.</li>
      <li>But this is a small price to pay for this natural and clean moisturizer.</li>
      <li>and I my face is just starting to lose the large, red post-pimple marks.</li>
      <li>my whole face gets really dry.</li>
      <li>I use this as the 3rd step to aveeno clear complexion face wash and the clear complexion astringent.</li>
      <li>I have tried a variety of products to help fade my dark scars from acne and nothing has worked as consistently as Aveeno Clear Complexion.</li>
      <li>For few weeks, I have been using neutrogena Oil free acne wash followed by aveeno cc daily moisturizer</li>
      <li>While I do really like using this product, I find that it tends to be on the more expensive side.</li>
      <li>No other moisturizer keeps me oil-free while providing moisture to my skin.  </li>
      <li>It hasn&#x27;t made it worse compared to any other moisturizer, but I&#x27;ve been breaking out more since repurchased it after my first bottle ran out.</li>
      <li>The quality makes it worth the price, and fixing it a little bit would make sales soar.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Aveeno&#x27;s Clear Complexion daily moisturizer both moisturizes AND treats my existing breakouts.</li>
      <li>prior to trying this and the moment I switched, my acne cleared and has been clear ever since.  </li>
      <li>The Aveeno Clear Complexion, during the week of use, caused my pores to become larger and release a lot of oil throughout the day.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for 5 years (since I was 16), and will likely continue with it until I get mature skin.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had any break out so far, and that&#x27;s the only reason I keep using it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m changing to Burt&#x27;s Bees similar products for sensitive skin and acne  (with salicylic acid) items.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soo soft and leaves your skin so moisturized, and at the same time it helps prevent breakouts and also helps fight acne scars.</li>
      <li>I think my skin is about as sensitive as the next person.</li>
      <li>experiencing such varying climates in such a short amount of time really made my acne flair up...</li>
      <li>My 19 year old daughter uses this product daily to moisturize her face.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely the only daily facial lotion that works for me.</li>
      <li>main issue before using this moisturizer was my forehead would dry out in the winter and would have skin flakes.</li>
      <li>I am in my early 20s and no longer have a big issue with adolescent acne.</li>
      <li>It definitely helped calm down a lot of blemishes I have</li>
      <li>I recommend this product to those with very sensitive skin because it doesn&#x27;t have all the extra ingredients that some products such as proactive or neutrogena has.</li>
      <li>My skin gets very dry and oily and I highly suggest this item to moisturize and it is not oily at all.</li>
      <li>The only facial lotion i&#x27;ve found to work for my sensitive combination skin.  </li>
      <li>It also stays that way for many hours and although my face is usually oily, it doesn&#x27;t get TOO oily like other moisturizers I used prior to this one.</li>
      <li>Have been using this for a couple weeks and saw only a slight improvement in my complexion - at least I don&#x27;t get huge pimples as much as I did before using this lotion.</li>
      <li>Aveeno has been recommended to me by several dermatologists and general practitioners.</li>
      <li>I generally have monthly hormonally related breakouts.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Putting chemicals in the eyes of living animals, etc., is simply not necessary in today&#x27;s world; and I will not continue to purchase this product; in spite of how much I like it, due to Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s continued use of animal</li>
      <li>we live in a dry state and this product cleared teen acne and keeps her skin moist.</li>
      <li>I decided to get aveeno clear complexion daily moisturizer because I wanted something gentle enough for everyday usage and keep my skin clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it has completely taken care of the dry skin around my nose and mouth</li>
      <li>I have always had a problem with little breakouts here and there, but never with the large under-the-surface pimples that started appearing on my face.</li>
      <li>Also, I&#x27;m clearing up a little which is amazing progress as for almost 3 years, my acne has just gotten worse over time.</li>

<li> What I love best about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t make my face more oily, and it keeps my skin feeling refreshed even during the summer.</li>
<li> The pump is perfect and lets out the right amount.</li>
<li> Light weight, smells good... and it has spf!</li>
<li> The fragrance was also very light and pleasant.</li>
<li> My FAVORITE!</li>
<li> Love it!</li>
<li> I love it!</li>
<li> love it!</li>
<li> It even seemed like i was having more blemishes coming in than when i wasn&#x27;t using it!</li>
<li> The BIGGEST difference I&#x27;ve noticed is that the Aveeno reduces redness and gives me a more even skin tone, even before I apply makeup!</li>
<li> Love it!</li>
<li> I LOVE it!</li>
<li> Love it!</li>
<li> My favorite moisturizer, ever since I started using this over two years ago my face has been clearer than ever!</li>
<li> Love this stuff!</li>
<li> My favorite moisturizer!</li>
<li> I really love this moisturizer!  </li>
<li> and I absolutely love it!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m just glad that this stuff doesn&#x27;t make me break out in a bunch of zits!  </li>
<li> Love the way it smells too!</li>
<li> Love this lotion!</li>
<li> Love this stuff!</li>
<li> This smells really good and is very light.  </li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t had any acne since I have been using this product which is an amazing 2 weeks!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
<li> this lotion feels amazing.</li>
<li> Amazing...</li>
<li> This isn&#x27;t something you would use in warm months.</li>
<li> Even SPF 15 would have been nice.</li>
<li> /&gt;It smells good too :)</li>
<li> It makes your skin softer and does kind of even it out, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything for your acne, helps in absoloutly no way</li>
<li> This is one of the best this I&#x27;ve tried, It just a week much clearer skin.</li>
<li> I always use it many times a day and get good results.</li>
<li> i love this stuff..plus the price is good...</li>
<li> so i decided to go to the CVS and get something nice for myself.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s really the perfect balance for temperamental skin like mine.</li>
<li> Absolutely thrilled.</li>
<li> Excellent product..can&#x27;t live without it</li>
<li> but i live in a warmer place so this is perfect!</li>
<li> Aveeno products are the best, and this one works very well on many skin types.</li>
<li> Always love using Aveeno products and it&#x27;s doing me even greater good as it is winter.</li>
<li> but honestly this is so much better.</li>
<li> This is the best moisturiser so far for me.</li>
<li> This is the best moisturizer for me so far.</li>
<li> product is amazing and is much better than what I was using.</li>
<li> Would recommend you find another moisturizer and just use the cleanser because it&#x27;s actually a really effective product unlike this which may also give you breakouts in trade for better complexion</li>
<li> It clears up my acne, moisturizes my face, and makes it looks even, clear, and wonderful.</li>
<li> Aveeno Clear Complexion works great!</li>
<li> a good moisturizer is important.</li>
<li> I was so excited to see if it would work that i put it on in my car, and even then i could feel it was good for my skin.</li>
<li> was so happy when I first tried this.</li>
<li> Very light.</li>
<li> Very light, not greasy.  </li>
<li> Works well on all types of skin, is not oily and has a very light scent.</li>
<li> but the lotion is very light weight and not oily.</li>
<li> Very light and non-greasy feeling.  </li>
<li> i used this before and it&#x27;s very light</li>
<li> I love the foaming cleanser, but not the case with this moisturizer.</li>
<li> I also love the lotion but wish it had some spf.</li>
<li> this does the trick while also helping my skin to look more even.</li>
<li> I absolutely love the feel and smell of this moisturizer.  </li>
<li> Did I mention that it&#x27;s oil free?!?  </li>
<li> I absolutely love love love this lotion I been using it for a couple of years</li>
<li> and I get fast shipping from the seller great service</li>
<li> I love all Aveeno skin care products I use.</li>
<li> I love the stuff.</li>
<li> In fact, they gave me more acne then before I started using them.</li>
<li> After trying so many drugstore brands, I decided to try aveeno out recommended to me by a dear friend.</li>
<li> This is an excellent cream for winter dryness - both my two daughters &amp; myself use it daily on our faces.</li>
<li> My favorite moisturizer of all time.  </li>
<li> and you&#x27;re looking for a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin and feels more \\&quot;lotiony\\&quot; (vs. hydrating)</li>
<li> It also contains soy, which is shown to help reduce scarring after blemishes, which is perfect for a teen, like myself.</li>
<li> and of course there is more in the package.</li>
<li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
<li> My complexion is better after using it for a month.  </li>
<li> My tone is more even</li>
<li> and sometimes I will even go to town with no make-up because I feel confident without it.  </li>
<li> stopped using it all together because my face seems to do alot better when using Proactiv, so i dont know what it is..</li>
<li> , no breakouts and my skin looks more even toned.  </li>
<li> Love the feel of this cream.</li>
<li> and I love this product.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried many face lotions but seems like I have to apply more than once to get the effect that I like.</li>
<li> This order always arrives literally 2 days after I buy it, and I am in love with how this moisturizer makes my skin feel.</li>
<li> and I must say this is one of the better moisturizers I&#x27;ve come across.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s okay</li>
<li> This is the only moisturizer that I will use as it is the perfect balance of moisture and thickness.</li>
<li> I use this daily after showers and it continues to be my skin&#x27;s best friend.</li>
<li> I love this lotion.</li>
<li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
<li> LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
<li> Perfect for daily wear!</li>
<li> and I love the smell of it as I put it on my face.  </li>
<li> I love this moisturizer.</li>
<li> :)  </li>
<li> I love this face lotion</li>
<li> My skin tone is even and looks healthy and glowing and it has reduced acne and acne scarring.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using for many years...</li>
<li> Gentle and great for acne prone skin.</li>
<li> I LOVE Aveeno.</li>
<li> more redness, and</li>
<li> I love this product.  </li>
<li> I have also found that it imparts better tone and clarity too.  </li>
<li> I absolutely love the scent and the texture.</li>
<li> I love this moisturizer</li>
<li> and I will get more</li>
<li> I think it&#x27;s a perfect product in preventing acne as well as improving overall skin</li>
<li> my acne started getting better )</li>
<li> I love Aveeno products.</li>
<li> Love this moisturizer.</li>
<li> I started using this product a month ago, and it caused more acne on the sides of my cheek and forehead.</li>
<li> I would recommend this product to my friends :)</li>
<li> They have better products.</li>
<li> I love this and use it every day.</li>
<li> Price was just okay</li>
<li> It is really light weight and has a SPF Protection factor which is really nice it.</li>
<li> It keeps me moisturized while not over moisturizing hers! :)</li>
<li> The smell is ok too.</li>
<li> We buy this Aveeno, and it&#x27;s ok.</li>
<li> &amp; I guess I have to admit it got better over time</li>
<li> my face and skin has cleared up, and is much more toned</li>
<li> , I love Aveeno&#x27;s products.</li>
<li> Nothing works better for my skin then this.</li>
<li> soooooo glad to have found this</li>
<li> I absolutely love aveeno products.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s liquid magic.</li>
<li> and I can apply foundation on top of it</li>
<li> I love that I can use both products twice a day and not have to worry about my skin drying out.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m able to use that doesn&#x27;t cause pimples</li>
<li> i LOVE this moisturizer.</li>
<li> Any more that one squirt</li>
<li> Love how it feels and smell.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m still not quite sure why my skin reacted like this</li>
<li> I love this moisturizer.</li>
<li> I think that Neutrogena is a better product.</li>
<li> I love this stuff.</li>
<li> This is the best moisturizer I’ve ever tried and works amazingly for me (although there is certainly no guarantee it will work for everyone).  </li>
<li> and so far so good!  </li>
<li> So far, so good!</li>
<li> It leaves a nice clean feeling on my face.  </li>
<li> It is easy absorbing, and has a great scent.  </li>
<li> I love this stuff, great for sensitive skin.</li>
<li> Works great to clear blemishes</li>
<li> They work great for my sensitive skin.</li>
<li> The lotion itself is a great moisturizer and is not heavy at all.</li>
<li> /&gt;We are so happy to have clear</li>
<li> Most importantly it breaks me out.</li>
<li> Works great for my acne prone sensitive skin .</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m good for the whole day.</li>
<li> I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone with mild acne issues or infrequent break-outs, and to anyone who just wants a great moisturizer.</li>
<li> it was nice, but didn&#x27;t have the right amount of acne medication for me.</li>
<li> LoL) to see if it would work better than Proactiv which i am currently using... I was also looking for a cheaper alternative than Proactiv.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Love this product, and with Amazons low prices its a great buy.</li>
<li> I used to be acne and pimple free till I was about 18 years old; then the outbreaks started happening lol.</li>
<li> /&gt;I was really happy when i put on the product because my face felt really soft and smooth.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m sure the 0.5 Salicylic Acid is good for sensitive skin.</li>
<li> no need to overdo as it spreads easily across your face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I also like that this product has a very mild scent.</li>
<li> It does a good job moisturizing for the whole day, while still being a light formula.</li>
<li> For makeup, aveeno creates a very smooth canvas for foundation and absorbs the makeup quite quickly.</li>
<li> Other than that, this is my favorite drugstore moisturizer!!!</li>
<li> My daughter spends a lot of money on acne products and I&#x27;m a huge fan of Aveeno brand.  </li>
<li> &quot; My skin is smooth and even.</li>
<li> This is so light and not greasy at all.</li>
<li> Light smell.  </li>
<li> This product will do wonders at keeping your skin blemish free.</li>
<li> After use of this moisturizer, my face becomes really smooth</li>
<li> I think it&#x27;s the Aveeno brand, they are great with my skin type, which is why I keep coming back to them.</li>
<li> The moisturizer is the perfect amount of moisturizing without feeling too heavy.  </li>
<li> although this product really helped me see a difference, it now seems like my face has kind of gotten used to it</li>
<li> It also smells very neutral, but nice.</li>
<li> Goes on smooth.  </li>
<li> This is a great facial moisturizer and blemish fighter.</li>
<li> Someone actually commented how great my face looked.</li>
<li> I like this moisturizer because it&#x27;s light and helps with the complexion, it also has SPF and protects the sun.</li>
<li> moisturizer is great as it keep my facial skin moist and keeps my acne somewhat under control.</li>
<li> Use it everyday and the price is perfect for the product that you get!</li>
<li> I have always loved Aveeno&#x27;s clear complexion line.  </li>
<li> Been using it for a couple of weeks and so far it&#x27;s good 👍</li>
<li> My face is so soft and clear and just great!</li>
<li> We just don&#x27;t go back because even though the quality makes the price fair, it needs to do more to make the price payable.</li>
<li> The cream has a light, clean consistency that applies smoothly and doesn&#x27;t clog pours.</li>
<li> The product is very smooth and gentle, and absorbs very quickly.</li>
<li> Either way, its worth trying!</li>
<li> My skin has cleared significantly from this product.  </li>
<li> but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s while worth it!</li>
<li> Will buy again - it&#x27;s definitely worth the money!</li>
<li> With both the Aveeno scrub and this lotion my skin (on my face) has been very healthy and soft.</li>
<li> The scent is clean and not overbearing.</li>
<li> Now my face looks and feels super smooth.</li>
<li> Nothing I found made my face feel clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I am very happy so far.. bought this for my teenage daughter.  </li>
<li> Also love the Positively Radiant moisturizer.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s OK when my face absorbed it but gets oily very fast.</li>
<li> product is very affordable and I love that it is 4 oz.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Good enough for me!</li>
<li> It really evened out my skin tone (though it still has a way to go, I try to be thankful for how much better</li>
<li> Not greasy, feels light, smells fresh.</li>
<li> but then my face full of pimple and blackheads...</li>
<li> I love this face wash so much.</li>
<li> I honestly bought it because it said clear complexion</li>
<li> So that bottle will last a good while.</li>
<li> My face is naturally really dry and this lotion is absolutely perfect for me and my sister who&#x27;s face is naturally greasy.</li>
<li> I goes on really smooth and soaks right into your face with no oily residue or sticky feeling</li>
<li> Was fine at first</li>
<li> I will be back to order more and more</li>
<li> I use it at night before bed after washing my face with Cetaphil and in the morning after a quick rinse off of my face</li>
<li> This is a great everyday light moisturizer for acne prone teens.  </li>
<li> This is still moisturizing but also has help with mild pimples or bumps.  </li>
<li> I have mild acne w. Flare UPS on my chin area.</li>
<li> Great for my skin, soft scent and makes my face so soft.</li>
<li> I love Aveeno facial care products because they are gentle and effective in fading scars and evening out my skin tone.</li>
<li> This worked better then clean &amp; clear, and proactiv.</li>
<li> I have tried many more expensive products but this works the best to keep my skin clear, without drying it.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if they just have great B2B marketing or what, but I really enjoy this product.</li>
<li> It dissolves quickly, and the scent is not too powerful.</li>
<li> I have used dozens of products, the cheapo and the good stuff, and I found one may help some of the dry skin but by the end of the day I&#x27;d end up with a whitehead somewhere on my face.</li>
<li> but my skin is pretty clear although it does have its own bumps here and there.</li>
<li> While this product will work if I&#x27;m in a pinch, I&#x27;d rather shell out a little more cash for the Origins brand moisturizer and get some more bang for my buck!</li>
<li> First lotion I have used that didn&#x27;t clog my pores!</li>
<li> I use it daily, sometimes twice a day, I just love the way it feels!</li>
<li> A great sunscreen year round to protect and moisturize your skin.</li>
<li> It works fairly well for me, but I have better results from Origins and their products aren&#x27;t that much more expensive.</li>
<li> Smells fresh.</li>
<li> I love my skin now because it is so soft and my problem areas have faded away.</li>
<li> It works even better with the Aveeno Clear Complexion scrub.  </li>
<li> worth the price.</li>
<li> but with delivery charges, the savings wasn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
<li> and i rarely EVER break out.</li>
<li> I love it more than any other product I use.</li>
<li> It feels good, smells good, and my skin in less dry.  </li>
<li> I always thought washing my skin too much would dry it out, but it&#x27;s just fine, and most importantly - pimple-free.</li>
<li> I like this face lotion because it goes on smooth, no heavy, oily or watery feeling, and it feels just right!</li>
<li> It helps to keep my complexion good and fade away some dark spots.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s the best moisturizer that I&#x27;ve tried on my skin, which is pretty dry and sensitive but was very oily in high school.</li>
<li> I have a sensitive oily skin that breaks out easily.</li>
<li> I added this product to my skincare regimen hoping that I had finally found a good moisturizer for sensitive skin.</li>
<li> After finding the Aveeno scrub I mentioned (in another review) how it can dry out your skin without some kind of face moisturizer.</li>
<li> The moisturizer is fast absorbing, makes ur skin smooth and even.</li>
<li> It goes on smoothly and is absorbed quickly with no shine after application or hours later.  </li>
<li> its good, a little drying to skin, but won&#x27;t cause breakouts</li>
<li> This second Aveeno product did not let me down at all.&lt;br /&gt;It is a very good moisturizer for the face.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m so glad I finally came across this product.</li>
<li> While first using the moisturizer, I broke out for about a week</li>
<li> This is the only moisturizer I have been able to find that doesn&#x27;t cause my face to break out, yet keeps it moist.</li>
<li> and you&#x27;d think this (being a heavier moisturizer) would be great but instead of hydrating the skin, it just leaves a thick layer of grease...feels \\&quot;gooey\\&quot;.</li>
<li> But I have been known to breakout if a product even looks at me funny.</li>
<li> This daily moisturizer works EVEN BETTER than the Skin Correcting Treatment</li>
<li> I am on my 3rd bottle now and still love it.  </li>
<li> I had faith in Aveeno because i love their lotion and decided to try this facial moisturizer (after spending like a hour in walmart trying to decide!</li>
<li> At first my skin cleared up after using it.</li>
<li> To combat these, I’ve tried many different moisturizers/topical treatments.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s light and not heavy.  </li>
<li> I am an 18 yr/old female with oily skin, and I use this every night and most mornings, too.  </li>
<li> which was the first thing I noticed.</li>
<li> I use as a night cream because there is no spf and must use consistently to see improvement.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never used many products to improve my skin, but I will definitely keep this in my stash</li>
<li> I&#x27;d be very upset if this product was discontinued!</li>
<li> I first started using this moisturizer after a road trip...</li>
<li> I bought this product because I was so in love with the Aveeno Daily Moisturizer Stress Relief with Lavender.</li>
<li> , I use it daily under my makeup and really love it.</li>
<li> For the price it is ten times better then name brand moisturizers and there is no perfumie scent added or nothing</li>
<li> Love it,  had been using this stuff for years,  only moisturizer I will use.</li>
<li> and if I wash my face and forget to put my moisturizer on, I can really feel the difference!  </li>
<li> now I notice my face clear,fair tone,no more acne,or even tiny bump...</li>
<li> I have used so many products and finally gave up.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s soft and light, but balances my skin&#x27;s oily/dry complexion and prevents acne.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and still keeps it smooth and hydrated even in the winter months.</li>
<li> Very moisturizing too!</li>
<li> I love this facial moisturizer.</li>
<li> likely this with combo of new face wash)&lt;br /&gt;recommended, &amp; love that it doesnt smell too strong, like many other acne meds</li>
<li> The entire Aveeno Clear Complexion line is amazing.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know what it is, but whenever I put this lotion on at night, I wake up with clear, clean, matte skin.</li>
<li> Wow, I have tried so many moisturizers to help control my adult acne.</li>
<li> My skin feels soft and smooth for the whole day.</li>
<li> I liked the idea of having a facial moisturizer that would also help keep my skin clear...</li>
<li> I tried the Aveeno Positively Radiant Skin with SPF 15</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if this does anything for taking away zits or blemishes, but it is a good moisturizer that I don&#x27;t worry about clogging my pores (maybe I should, but I don&#x27;t seem to get breakouts when I use it).</li>
<li> a friend had given me a small sample of this before, and I could never find it in stores, found it here on Amazon, and it came in shorter time than expected and it&#x27;s great!</li>
<li> I have struggled with chronic acne for years, and I&#x27;ve come to learn that high quality moisturizers are just as important as powerful topical treatments.</li>
<li> It has certainly helped my blemished skin.</li>
<li> Have a large one on side of cheek that didn&#x27;t change at all.</li>
<li> I would certainly have continued using the product if it weren&#x27;t for the fact that it just didn&#x27;t agree with my skin.</li>
<li> my holy grale!! can&#x27;t live without it !!</li>
<li> , i just look for products to cure the dark spots and blemishes on my face mostly to even out my skintone and bring out the beautiful brown that i know i have somewhere deep down inside &#x3D;-)</li>
<li> The price is affordable here, and in general, compared to other lotions that are of good quality.  </li>
<li> It leaves my face oil free for at least 6 hours and more depending on the weather and activity.</li>
<li> I get very oily around my t zone and i have huge pores that you can actually see from a mile away</li>
<li> This really is a life saving product line.</li>
<li> BUT NOTHING REALLY WORKED.</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t say that it helps with the acne as much as I&#x27;d like it to, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a fault with the product itself; just need to find what works for me.</li>
<li> I have combination skin that can get really oily, and I think this moisturizer works very well for my skin type.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not a miracle product by any stretch, but I really like the Aveeno moisturizer.</li>
<li> don&#x27;t really have ACNE</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that my makeup goes on much smoother than it did before.</li>
<li> Highly recommend!</li>
<li> I am AMAZED at how fast and how well this moisturizer worked.</li>
<li> Shipping was fast.</li>
<li> Oh well, I really wanted to believe Jennifer Anniston.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily on my t-zone area and moisturizes just enough to feel smooth on face.  </li>
<li> I’ve had acne my whole life.  </li>
<li> /&gt;But what I&#x27;d really like to say about this product is that it seems to help acne.</li>
<li> Bought this again, and now my face is so much clearer.</li>
<li> I have very oily skin and suffer from some breakouts.</li>
<li> I switched to this product when I noticed the Neutrogena Moisturizer wasn&#x27;t reducing the jawline acne as much as I wanted</li>
<li> I think this product works really well for what it says it</li>
<li> &amp; I didn&#x27;t think it was really making a difference for my skin.</li>
<li> Benzoyl peroxide dries skin too much to be used</li>
<li> I really think it was the soy that helped even out my skin tone and get rid of redness.</li>
<li> I do still really like this stuff, though.</li>
<li> I brought this as a last resort because I was waiting for an oil free moisturizer in the mail.</li>
<li> /&gt;However, i found aveeno face scrub wash worked really well with my skin, and decided to give this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Highly Recommend!</li>
<li> and you have too much.</li>
<li> It is very moisturizing and the salicylic acid is an added bonus.</li>
<li> I really love the aveeno clear complexion facial cleanser,  </li>
<li> Good moisturizer, not too thick.</li>
<li> B000052YJM Clean &amp; Clear ESSENTIALS Dual Action Moisturizer, 4 Ounce]]).</li>
<li> There&#x27;s no such a thing called purging when using facial products over the counter so please be aware when a product make you break out more.</li>
<li> but it still helps more than other moisturizers.</li>
<li> Combined with some other moisturizers, I have found a decent balance for my skin, so I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
<li> She really loves it and highly recommends it.</li>
<li> Highly recommended from someone very picky with face creams.</li>
<li> Leaves my skin kind of dry and red</li>
<li> Aveen Clear Complexion is the first moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used, and I have to say it did not disappoint.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogeno Oil Free Moisturizer for Combination Skin for the last few years, when I ran out of my latest bottle</li>
<li> Cystic acne is not fun to deal with and this brought out too many cysts around my chin and cheeks.  </li>
<li> Also, I am usually pretty sensitive to Salicylic Acid but for some reason it doesn&#x27;t bother me with this lotion.</li>
<li> Eventually with 5-7 new break outs a day!</li>
<li> Overall, no matter how many moisturizers I try, I always go back to this one.</li>
<li> Yes, better than the most expensive name brands.  </li>
<li> It really makes your skin look even and clear!</li>
<li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
<li> Highly recommended.</li>
<li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
<li> never had problem skin in high school, but once I hit college</li>
<li> I highly recommend it.</li>
<li> many moisturizers have a little bit of sun protection.  </li>
<li> It cost a little more then others</li>
<li> This moisturizer in particular is amazing, and I usually can never find it in stores which is why I strictly have to order it on Amazon - which I am not complaining about!</li>
<li> I am in my early 30s and have VERY finicky skin.</li>
<li> so far I really like it.</li>
<li> But for clear, healthy skin, it works just as well as much more expensive moisturizers I&#x27;ve been given by dermatologists.</li>
<li> Before this, I had been using the neutrogena moisturizer for sensitive skin, which seemed to make my face really greasy.</li>
<li> I feel it works better for my oily 35 year old skin than more expensive brand.</li>
<li> But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product if you&#x27;re in the normal or oily category.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not a pimple here and there that people normally get.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m so glad i bought it a few months ago</li>
<li> It is just a very simple basic face lotion that makes your skin soft and healthy.</li>
<li> nice and thick moisturizer, but the cap gets stuck at times.</li>
<li> It says it&#x27;s oil free, but that clearly can&#x27;t be the case because i have dry skin</li>
<li> Many moisturizers I tried left my skin feeling dry hours after or caused breakouts, but not this one.</li>
<li> I have sensitive skin due to rosacea and breakouts but this lotion has helped my skin get clear and feel smooth!</li>
<li> I usually use Clean &amp; Clear salicylic daily moisturizer and this has proven to be just like it in that it doesn&#x27;t cause me to breakout but gives me more moisture.</li>
<li> All in all, it&#x27;s a nice basic moisturizer for acne-prone skin, although it&#x27;s a little pricey.</li>
<li> Salicylic acid has never been effective on my acne, and I don&#x27;t think the very small amount of salicylic acid in this product did anything for me.</li>
<li> I have not seen any new pimple since I started using this.</li>
<li> I thought I&#x27;d try something new.</li>
<li> I take my time when adding a new product to my skincare routine so that I know if its going to break me out or not,</li>
<li> I do have been having new blemishes while using this product</li>
<li> It don&#x27;t look like new to me.</li>
<li> Perfect for cold days when my face skin was starting to peel :</li>
<li> Light daily moisturizer that provides just enough moisture without making your skin appear oily anytime of day!</li>
<li> My skin is very sensitive to allergens and is also acne prone.  </li>
<li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
<li> This product is very natural and calming.</li>
<li> I have very sensitive skin with some oily spots and acne..</li>
<li> My skin is very soft and looks amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> i have very sensitive skin, this doesn&#x27;t upset my skin.</li>
<li> Compared to neutrogena moisturizers, this feels so light and not greasy at all even if i stay  outside for a long time.</li>
<li> It absorbs very quickly and does not feel heavy or oily.</li>
<li> Will probably go back to Positively Radiant line.</li>
<li> Never left my skin too oily, and slight change in complexion for the better.</li>
<li> So if you have sensitive, dry skin this is definitely worth trying.</li>
<li> use this moisturizer with the Aveeno Clear Complexion Bar.</li>
<li> it didnt clear my face up..</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using Aveeno Clear Complexion Moisturizer for over a year now</li>
<li> I have problematic skin with blemishes and this product has helped clear my completion.</li>
<li> I was using Eminence Clear Skin Probiotic Moisturizer ($35/2 oz)</li>
<li> Our late teens and early 20 somethings love this moisturizer.</li>
<li> My skin was relatively clear except for some acne on my jawline.</li>
<li> Then I switched to the \\&quot;Clear</li>
<li> this product and the soap clear complexion..</li>
<li> I use the clear complexion face wash as well.</li>
<li> It helps keep my skin clear and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin either.</li>
<li> Works so well on my sensitive skin.</li>
<li> so far no breakouts</li>
<li> I am a 21 years old college student suffering from acne since about 9 years old.</li>
<li> AND MY FACE IS DARN NEAR CLEAR.</li>
<li> Of course, for modest to aggressive acne I suggest a prescription product like Retin-A</li>
<li> I&#x27;m 38 years old</li>
<li> It makes your skin so soft but</li>
<li> I have sensitive skin</li>
<li> Not as fast acting as I wanted.</li>
<li> My skin type: sensitive and on the oily side.</li>
<li> It really makes a difference especially in Cali where are weather is bi-polar</li>
<li> the next haha.</li>
<li> 12 year old son has been using it as well, and the pimples are almost all</li>
<li> I have sensitive skin</li>
<li> I have sensitive skin that has all kinds of issues.</li>
<li> but I&#x27;ve found this product to be gentle enough to apply every day and night for maintenance.</li>
<li> so far it hasn&#x27;t shown to be an issue in the breakout factor.</li>
<li> really noticed a different in the redness.</li>
<li> I have sensitive skin</li>
<li> Makes skin feel so soft.</li>
<li> My skin is naturally oily and quite prone to acne.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s really the only thing that works for me.</li>
<li> my skin feels soft.</li>
<li> leaves your face soft and smooth without a heavy oily feeling.</li>
<li> However, sadly this stuff isn&#x27;t that good.</li>
<li> I finally found a daily facial wash that worked well and didn&#x27;t completely dry out my skin (causing me to break out more!), but the combination of new skin wash and this moisturizer are what ultimately cleared up</li>
<li> I have tried many drugstore products - neutrogena, olay, burt&#x27;s bee, etc - and even the more expensive brands such as proactive, dermalogica and some other brands from sephora but none has really worked.</li>
<li> It isn&#x27;t oily and it absorbs quickly into the skin, but still leaves your face feeling good for at least a few hours on a dry wintery day.</li>
<li> i wash my face with aveeno soap,at first my face was so dry</li>
<li> I love that a little goes a long way!</li>
<li> Most of the positive reviews for this product are fake and just written by the sellers/ company themself.</li>
<li> After several weeks using the product every morning along with the Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Cleansing Pads, I have seen no improvement in my skin&#x27;s clarity.</li>
<li> This was the first face lotion I have ever used until it was absolutely empty.</li>
<li> But this is a small price to pay for this natural and clean moisturizer.</li>
<li> and I my face is just starting to lose the large, red post-pimple marks.</li>
<li> my whole face gets really dry.</li>
<li> I use this as the 3rd step to aveeno clear complexion face wash and the clear complexion astringent.</li>
<li> I have tried a variety of products to help fade my dark scars from acne and nothing has worked as consistently as Aveeno Clear Complexion.</li>
<li> For few weeks, I have been using neutrogena Oil free acne wash followed by aveeno cc daily moisturizer</li>
<li> While I do really like using this product, I find that it tends to be on the more expensive side.</li>
<li> No other moisturizer keeps me oil-free while providing moisture to my skin.  </li>
<li> It hasn&#x27;t made it worse compared to any other moisturizer, but I&#x27;ve been breaking out more since repurchased it after my first bottle ran out.</li>
<li> The quality makes it worth the price, and fixing it a little bit would make sales soar.</li>
<li> /&gt;Aveeno&#x27;s Clear Complexion daily moisturizer both moisturizes AND treats my existing breakouts.</li>
<li> prior to trying this and the moment I switched, my acne cleared and has been clear ever since.  </li>
<li> The Aveeno Clear Complexion, during the week of use, caused my pores to become larger and release a lot of oil throughout the day.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 5 years (since I was 16), and will likely continue with it until I get mature skin.</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t had any break out so far, and that&#x27;s the only reason I keep using it.</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;m changing to Burt&#x27;s Bees similar products for sensitive skin and acne  (with salicylic acid) items.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s soo soft and leaves your skin so moisturized, and at the same time it helps prevent breakouts and also helps fight acne scars.</li>
<li> I think my skin is about as sensitive as the next person.</li>
<li> experiencing such varying climates in such a short amount of time really made my acne flair up...</li>
<li> My 19 year old daughter uses this product daily to moisturize her face.  </li>
<li> Absolutely the only daily facial lotion that works for me.</li>
<li> main issue before using this moisturizer was my forehead would dry out in the winter and would have skin flakes.</li>
<li> I am in my early 20s and no longer have a big issue with adolescent acne.</li>
<li> It definitely helped calm down a lot of blemishes I have</li>
<li> I recommend this product to those with very sensitive skin because it doesn&#x27;t have all the extra ingredients that some products such as proactive or neutrogena has.</li>
<li> My skin gets very dry and oily and I highly suggest this item to moisturize and it is not oily at all.</li>
<li> The only facial lotion i&#x27;ve found to work for my sensitive combination skin.  </li>
<li> It also stays that way for many hours and although my face is usually oily, it doesn&#x27;t get TOO oily like other moisturizers I used prior to this one.</li>
<li> Have been using this for a couple weeks and saw only a slight improvement in my complexion - at least I don&#x27;t get huge pimples as much as I did before using this lotion.</li>
<li> Aveeno has been recommended to me by several dermatologists and general practitioners.</li>
<li> I generally have monthly hormonally related breakouts.</li>
<li> /&gt;Putting chemicals in the eyes of living animals, etc., is simply not necessary in today&#x27;s world; and I will not continue to purchase this product; in spite of how much I like it, due to Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s continued use of animal</li>
<li> we live in a dry state and this product cleared teen acne and keeps her skin moist.</li>
<li> I decided to get aveeno clear complexion daily moisturizer because I wanted something gentle enough for everyday usage and keep my skin clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> it has completely taken care of the dry skin around my nose and mouth</li>
<li> I have always had a problem with little breakouts here and there, but never with the large under-the-surface pimples that started appearing on my face.</li>
<li> Also, I&#x27;m clearing up a little which is amazing progress as for almost 3 years, my acne has just gotten worse over time.</li>
<li> It helped to calm my skin down and made the redness a lot less noticeable.</li>
<li> and I know my clear skin is due to this lotion.</li>
<li> I have been using it for a few years now as it works very well for my type of complexion, i.e. combination skin (dry patches, oily T-zone and aging/mature skin).  </li>
<li> My friend recommended this moisturizer especially for winter months when my skin has been seemingly extra dry.  </li>
<li> Leaves my skin smooth and I notice a brightening effect as well as a subtle diminish of dark spots.</li>
<li> Its not heavy and does not weigh down the face.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s been about a week and a half since I used Aveeno Clear Complexion</li>
<li> His skin is clearer than it use to be and his razor burn is less frequent and severe.  </li>
<li> My face is red and dry now because of this.  </li>
<li> you have dry skin and the occasional breakout</li>
<li> I tried facial moisturizers, but they were so greasy and they did NOTHING for my dry skin.</li>
<li> Since I was little, I&#x27;ve always had acne with a weird twist of oily skin in the summer and super dry skin in the winter on certain parts of my face.</li>
<li> While this moisturizer has not cleared my skin entirely, I do see a difference when used in conjunction with other products (Clearisil daily face wash &amp; a charcoal konjac sponge).</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using Aveeno Clear Complexion twice daily for the past year, and my skin looks healthier than ever.</li>
<li> But, that&#x27;s a minor gripe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> but not very moisturizing, maybe I don&#x27;t use enough.</li>
<li> I think i will be using this for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m</li>
<li> It absorbs very fast and I don&#x27;t feel any sticky or oily at all, unlike the previous brands I used in the past.</li>
<li> and I wanted to try a less expensive night time moisturizer since my face had mostly balanced out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> and I thought it might fix the redness as long as my dry sin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I use it two times daily a little goes along way for me a 4 0z bottle can last me 2 months</li>
<li> The price seems steep but this stuff lasts a long time!</li>
<li> Moisturizes just as well as any other Aveeno facial lotion -</li>
<li> I have dry skin</li>
<li> I guess if you have dry skin</li>
<li> This doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry out or feel anymore oily than it is.</li>
<li> ; non-greasy lotion helps my dry skin.</li>
<li> All others will make my skin flaky and/or dry.</li>
<li> I am using the product now, and expect its moisture in the coming dry Spring season.</li>
<li> I need this all the time to prevent my face from getting dry and  cracked.  </li>
<li> I have sensitive oily acne prone skin and while this lotion felt nice my face hated it.</li>
<li> Im not sure how clear its keeping my complexion</li>
<li> but I&#x27;ll stick to African black soap ...</li>
<li> I use it everyday especially in 32 degree weather which has a tendency to make your skin dry.  </li>
<li> Aveeno Clear complex ruin keeps my face moisturizer without feeling oily</li>
<li> Because of it my face is now covered in pimples, whereas before I only had a few.</li>
<li> Since, I&#x27;ve change my skin regimen, my breakouts have been minimal to nil.</li>
<li> I decided to give the product another try as I have spent $14 on the bottle.</li>
<li> moisturizing &amp; fragrance are meet my expected.</li>
<li> Not really.</li>
<li> The only thing I wish it had was an SPF to protect against the harsh sun.</li>
<li> I only put this on at night because it&#x27;s too heavy to wear during the day and makes my face sweat</li>
<li> a little goes a long way.  </li>
<li> I just started having a lot of breakouts from high stress and poor eating habits.</li>
<li> I WAS INITIALLY A BIT SKEPTICAL ABOUT TRYING THE PRODUCT BECAUSE I HAVEN&#x27;T SEEN ANY TESTAMENTS ON HOW IT WORKS ON AFRICAN AMERICAN SKIN TONES.</li>
<li> I just started using this to try and help with some of the break outs and other issues</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve spent a ton on pricey face creams but this one gives the others a run for their money!</li>
<li> Even if it doesn&#x27;t start clearing up my few minor breakouts I am going to use it because I like how it doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily feeling</li>
<li> and it doesn&#x27;t just make the foundation sit on my face and be noticeable like other facial moisturizers I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
<li> The wash/soap alone may leave your skin a little dry, but this product will fix that.  </li>
<li> I like it, but it can be a little dry</li>
<li> Though a little expensive I think the product is worth the money.</li>
<li> so I&#x27;m very careful with products that I choose.</li>
<li> so I have to be very careful about what I use.</li>
<li> It is thick enough that i can get proper coverage for just a small amount.</li>
<li> White heads, black heads, and caused acne scars to appear darker than they usually would.</li>
<li> My face has some pretty bad acne and scarring, especially before trying this moisturizer.</li>
<li> My only complaint is, that it doesn&#x27;t contain sunscreen.</li>
<li> I AM A BELIEVER IT HAS CLEARED MY ACNE AND MY DARK SPOTS</li>
<li> lately in stores they are smaller bottles.</li>
<li> and I see no diffrence in helping fade dark spots.  </li>
<li> my skin usually doesn&#x27;t give me problems, but lately my skin became red and dry.</li>
<li> Aveeno has got the moisture formula down.</li>
<li> I need about twice as much for my entire face as I did of the Neutrogena, which means I&#x27;ll run out faster (not good for how expensive it is.)</li>
<li> Does not feel heavy like other moisturizers or lotions.  </li>
<li> I get a few pimples once in a while and other than my t zone</li>
<li> Wish I could get it for less than $11.99 plus tax &amp; shipping but</li>
<li> and I&#x27;ve had less breakouts.  </li>
<li> My twenties and my thirties have seen some flare-ups (though nothing as serious as my teenage years).  </li>
<li> It also leaves a slight sheen that I don&#x27;t care for.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a bit thicker and does leave a slight greasy feeling on my skin.  </li>
<li> (I previously and again use [[ASIN:</li>
<li> My skin tone was very uneven and rough and had some slight acne scarring before using this product.</li>
<li> Would benefit if formula was a little less heavy+lighter (there is a difference</li>
<li> i have very sensitive skin and the wrong stuff can cause me to break out.  </li>
<li> It helps a little with acne, as well.</li>
<li> just a little pump once a day after my shower</li>
<li> not sure if it was due to this,&lt;br</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a year now</li>
<li> every little mishap on my face</li>
<li> But a little will go along way.</li>
<li> The only issue I have is that you can find it less expensive at other stores when they&#x27;re having a sales event.</li>
<li> The moisture can definitly be felt but it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.  </li>
<li> and I used to purchase it at WalMart but found it a few dollars cheaper on here</li>
<li> I have combination to oily skin, and it keeps my skin moisturized without feeling heavy.  </li>
<li> I wear it everyday.</li>
<li> Waste of my money, but</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried neutrogena, proactive,and olay to name a few.  </li>
<li> I use it everyday.</li>
<li> so putting it on feels  messy and like your asking for acne.</li>
<li> - it goes on smoothly, no burning or itching, and seems to protect your skin from the elements.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference after just a few days.</li>
<li> I still have a few pimples here and there, but I&#x27;m going to see what this product can do after I&#x27;ve been using it a few weeks.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m 34 years old and still get random acne.  </li>
<li> I wanted to remove my dead skin</li>
<li> It claims to be oil free yet it just sits on your face &amp; doesn&#x27;t moisturizer &amp; just makes my combo skin have that SHINY effect that I hate.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t believe i wasted money on this</li>
<li> I probably wouldn&#x27;t suggest using this if you have serious acne because there is not very much salicylic acid in it.</li>
<li> I HAVE ADULT ACNE AND ITS VERY FRUSTRATING.</li>
<li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s a little thick and gluey -</li>
<li> have tried various different types (both expensive name brands and not so expensive ones from drug stores and other retail) and hadn&#x27;t found one I</li>
<li> and it was a little thick when applied.</li>
<li> Back it went, sadly.</li>
<li> but it got too expensive and it was only 1.7 oz.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
<li> I usually break out in the summer.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this moisturizer for the past 2 years</li>
<li> but they are not sore like they usually were and they go away faster.</li>
<li> However, after using this for 3 days, my face broke out with 10-15 small pimples in between my eye brows, on both cheeks and on my chin.  </li>
<li> so it is hard to find something that will moisturize without making me look overly oily and</li>
<li> Perhaps it was the soy complex</li>
<li> This moisturizer is so thick and sticky and leaves an oily residue.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s way to thick</li>
<li> i&#x27;ve had acne prone skin in the past 3years and nothing helped me except this product!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m VERY sensitive to smells for face cream and hate oily or thick on my face.  </li>
<li> I like the subtle fragrance too.</li>
<li> Seriously, buy it.</li>
<li> and it unfortunately makes my skin break out a little.  </li>
<li> I used to use this moisturizer and stopped a few months ago because of how expensive it is</li>
<li> I have been using this product for at least 6 months and have no problem with it!</li>
<li> So I&#x27;d tough it out without moisturizers to avoid the stubborn pimples...until this stuff.</li>
<li> It is very very thick and feels oily when applying.</li>
<li> Very thick in texture and not moisturizing.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a sucker for everything, therefore Ill try anything no matter the price.</li>
<li> I have oily acne prone skin and this made my skin burn and break out even worse.  </li>
<li> I stuck with this product for about a week, to at least give it a chance, but the acne became increasingly worse!</li>
<li> But my face has been nothing but broken out since I stopped using it...</li>
<li> I have not experienced any breakouts from this product.</li>
<li> Seems to be helping and keeping the acne from getting worse.</li>
<li> However, after a few more days, I noticed my skin was getting worst and worst.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have bad acne at all, I just break out a few days every month</li>
<li> I have tried expensive ones before.</li>
<li> However, I checked and was sorry to learn that Aveeno products are animal tested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It&#x27;s just so expensive and</li>
<li> Needless to say this was not the product for me.</li>
<li> I ran out once and had to use a different brand for a couple of days and my skin returned to its evil ways.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, my face still has a way to go before it&#x27;s scar-free and</li>
<li> im using these,used those expensive cream</li>
<li> and I broke out like crazy.</li>
<li> This is just so disappointing from Aveeno.</li>
<li> IT MOISTURIZED WITHOUT A GREASY FEEL, which I was beginning to feel was impossible.</li>
<li> Also dont buy the foaming cleanser for this product, its equally bad.</li>
<li> It was particuarly bad after i got out of the shower.</li>
<li> hate to give a Aveeno product a bad review, but this stuff just did not like me or something...</li>
<li> Pore-clogging crap.</li>
<li> I hate lotions because it makea me feel like i have something on my face and some will make me break out as well.  </li>
<li> This moisturizer is absolutely terrible.</li>
<li> Well by Week 3, my skin was just disgusting.</li>
<li> IT DOESNT WORK, IT JUST MAKES YOUR SKIN WORST.</li>
<li> I have terrible acne.</li>
<li> Like another reviewer said it acually caused terrible cystic acne for me.  </li>
<li> this product is AWFUL.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My FAVORITE! I went to olay for a second there, based on glowing reviews from friends... but honestly this is so much better. Light weight, smells good... and it has spf! I&#x27;ve been using this for 5 years (since I was 16), and will likely continue with it until I get mature skin.</li>
    <li> I love the foaming cleanser, but not the case with this moisturizer. It is very very thick and feels oily when applying. It&#x27;s OK when my face absorbed it but gets oily very fast. This isn&#x27;t something you would use in warm months. I haven&#x27;t had any break out so far, and that&#x27;s the only reason I keep using it. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this face lotion for my boyfriend and while that he uses it to his guy friends, he loves it.  I know whenever he is using it because he lets out this kind of happy sigh and when I tease him about it he says &amp;#34;but it just feels so good&amp;#34;.  His skin is clearer than it use to be and his razor burn is less frequent and severe.  I also love the lotion but wish it had some spf.</li>
    <li> Aveeno has been recommended to me by several dermatologists and general practitioners. I&#x27;m not sure if they just have great B2B marketing or what, but I really enjoy this product. My skin is very sensitive to allergens and is also acne prone.  I apply after every cleansing &amp; it lasts until the next. Very light.</li>
    <li> I use this every day! Love it!</li>
    <li> This is my go-to daily moisturizer. I have combination skin so it is hard to find something that will moisturize without making me look overly oily and this does the trick while also helping my skin to look more even.</li>
    <li> While I do really like using this product, I find that it tends to be on the more expensive side. It works fairly well for me, but I have better results from Origins and their products aren&#x27;t that much more expensive. While this product will work if I&#x27;m in a pinch, I&#x27;d rather shell out a little more cash for the Origins brand moisturizer and get some more bang for my buck!</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturiser that I have ever tried. Works so well on my sensitive skin. I have tried expensive ones before. Nothing can beat this one. This is the best moisturiser so far for me.</li>
    <li> Works great to clear blemishes</li>
    <li> My complexion has improved since using this. Its been a montg now. I even use this on my chest.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the feel and smell of this moisturizer.  The moisture can definitly be felt but it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.  The scent is clean and not overbearing. I&#x27;ve been using this for 3-4 days now and so far no breakouts so I think I finally found a daily moisterizer that works.  Wish I could get it for less than $11.99 plus tax &amp; shipping but thankful I finally found something that works!</li>
    <li> Wow, I have tried so many moisturizers to help control my adult acne. I&#x27;m so glad I finally came across this product. While first using the moisturizer, I broke out for about a week and then it stopped. It took about a week for my skin to adjust to the medication. I have been using this for about six months now, my face now has a \\&quot;glow.\\&quot; My skin is smooth and even. Did I mention that it&#x27;s oil free?!?  My only complaint is, that it doesn&#x27;t contain sunscreen. Even SPF 15 would have been nice. Other than that, this is my favorite drugstore moisturizer!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love love love this lotion I been using it for a couple of years and it has improved my skin texture and clarity I use it two times daily a little goes along way for me a 4 0z bottle can last me 2 months and I used to purchase it at WalMart but found it a few dollars cheaper on here and I get fast shipping from the seller great service I will be back to order more and more (~.^)  *¢½**¢½**¢½**¢½**¢½*</li>
    <li> I have always loved Aveeno&#x27;s clear complexion line.  The wash/soap alone may leave your skin a little dry, but this product will fix that.  It is easy absorbing, and has a great scent.  I can&#x27;t wait to see my skin improve.  This really is a life saving product line.</li>
    <li> I love all Aveeno skin care products I use. They work great for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is the only moisturizer I have been able to find that doesn&#x27;t cause my face to break out, yet keeps it moist. I love the stuff.</li>
    <li> I am a 21 years old college student suffering from acne since about 9 years old. Since I was little, I&#x27;ve always had acne with a weird twist of oily skin in the summer and super dry skin in the winter on certain parts of my face. I have tried many drugstore products - neutrogena, olay, burt&#x27;s bee, etc - and even the more expensive brands such as proactive, dermalogica and some other brands from sephora but none has really worked. In fact, they gave me more acne then before I started using them. After trying so many drugstore brands, I decided to try aveeno out recommended to me by a dear friend. Aveeno has a very attractive scent to their moisturizer which my boyfriend loves. The product is very smooth and gentle, and absorbs very quickly. It leaves my face oil free for at least 6 hours and more depending on the weather and activity. I have not seen any new pimple since I started using this. For makeup, aveeno creates a very smooth canvas for foundation and absorbs the makeup quite quickly. All-in-all, I would recommend this product for anyone suffering from dry/oily skin and acne prone skin</li>
    <li> This is the only moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried that doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out and actually seems to help it.  I have combination to oily skin, and it keeps my skin moisturized without feeling heavy.  I love it!</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS EVERYTHING. I HAVE ADULT ACNE AND ITS VERY FRUSTRATING. I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING IN THE BOOK BUT NOTHING REALLY WORKED. I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR ONLY TWO WEEKS AND MY FACE IS DARN NEAR CLEAR. I WAS INITIALLY A BIT SKEPTICAL ABOUT TRYING THE PRODUCT BECAUSE I HAVEN&#x27;T SEEN ANY TESTAMENTS ON HOW IT WORKS ON AFRICAN AMERICAN SKIN TONES. I AM A BELIEVER IT HAS CLEARED MY ACNE AND MY DARK SPOTS ARE STARTING TO FADE. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
    <li> Excellent product..can&#x27;t live without it</li>
    <li> This is an excellent cream for winter dryness - both my two daughters &amp; myself use it daily on our faces.</li>
    <li> i  like it very much good&lt;br /&gt;buy it again!</li>
    <li> Not greasy unlike the cheaper stuff I&#x27;d been using before.  Can&#x27;t say that it helps with the acne as much as I&#x27;d like it to, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a fault with the product itself; just need to find what works for me.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin that can get really oily, and I think this moisturizer works very well for my skin type. I like to apply it on my cheeks to keep them from drying out, especially now that the weather&#x27;s getting colder. The back of the bottle claims that it improves the texture and evens out skin tone, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement although I&#x27;ve used the product for over a year. All in all, it&#x27;s a nice basic moisturizer for acne-prone skin, although it&#x27;s a little pricey.</li>
    <li> My favorite moisturizer of all time.  It&#x27;s the only that works with my oily skin.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is so thick and sticky and leaves an oily residue. I have dry skin and you&#x27;d think this (being a heavier moisturizer) would be great but instead of hydrating the skin, it just leaves a thick layer of grease...feels \\&quot;gooey\\&quot;. I even had to wash my hands to get it off. I guess if you have dry skin and you&#x27;re looking for a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin and feels more \\&quot;lotiony\\&quot; (vs. hydrating) then this is the product for you. But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product if you&#x27;re in the normal or oily category.</li>
    <li> I tried this and bought my girst bottle at walmart and it&#x27;s cheaper by $3 here, tax not included. This is the best moisturizer for me so far. This is so light and not greasy at all. I have a sensitive oily skin that breaks out easily. I have been religious with neutrogena oil-free moistirizers but recently i had breaks with it so i switched. Compared to neutrogena moisturizers, this feels so light and not greasy at all even if i stay  outside for a long time. No shine all day guaranteed and no drying ( maybe because it&#x27;s summer time) but i live in a warmer place so this is perfect! I never had an issue with dryness/ peeling or whatsoever like the others would say. It&#x27;s cheaper here so im purchasing my next bottles at amazon!!</li>
    <li> Perhaps it was the soy complex but it broke my skin out. I have sensitive oily acne prone skin and while this lotion felt nice my face hated it. Back it went, sadly.</li>
    <li> i have very sensitive skin and the wrong stuff can cause me to break out.  This is a great product!  The only facial lotion i&#x27;ve found to work for my sensitive combination skin.  a little goes a long way.  leaves your face soft and smooth without a heavy oily feeling.</li>
    <li> Aveeno products are the best, and this one works very well on many skin types. Also love the Positively Radiant moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Overall, no matter how many moisturizers I try, I always go back to this one. And that&#x27;s saying something. I&#x27;m a sucker for everything, therefore Ill try anything no matter the price. With that said, for this price and the results I get, its a steal! This doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry out or feel anymore oily than it is. It also contains soy, which is shown to help reduce scarring after blemishes, which is perfect for a teen, like myself. Either way, its worth trying!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle product by any stretch, but I really like the Aveeno moisturizer. I am in my early 30s and have VERY finicky skin. I generally have monthly hormonally related breakouts. But I have been known to breakout if a product even looks at me funny. While this moisturizer has not cleared my skin entirely, I do see a difference when used in conjunction with other products (Clearisil daily face wash &amp; a charcoal konjac sponge). It does a good job moisturizing for the whole day, while still being a light formula.</li>
    <li> Never buy back, my skin rash.</li>
    <li> I have tried a variety of products to help fade my dark scars from acne and nothing has worked as consistently as Aveeno Clear Complexion. This daily moisturizer works EVEN BETTER than the Skin Correcting Treatment and of course there is more in the package. I love Aveeno facial care products because they are gentle and effective in fading scars and evening out my skin tone. I am a U.S. born african woman with medium-dark brown skin and a tendency towards acne. Of course, for modest to aggressive acne I suggest a prescription product like Retin-A but this is an EXCELLENT addition to any skin care regimen. This product is my beauty and skin care MUST-HAVE and I absolutely love it. I wear it everyday.</li>
    <li> Not greasy and great for my face.</li>
    <li> i just applied yesterday and already my blemish is diminishing. love it!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.  My complexion is better after using it for a month.  I can definitely tell a difference.  I use it with the cream cleanser. My tone is more even and I&#x27;ve had less breakouts.  I&#x27;m 38 years old and sometimes I will even go to town with no make-up because I feel confident without it.  I am on my 3rd bottle now and still love it.  Very light, not greasy.  Light smell.  Smells fresh. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I had faith in Aveeno because i love their lotion and decided to try this facial moisturizer (after spending like a hour in walmart trying to decide! LoL) to see if it would work better than Proactiv which i am currently using... I was also looking for a cheaper alternative than Proactiv.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me it leaves my face too oily which makes me break out. It even seemed like i was having more blemishes coming in than when i wasn&#x27;t using it! I don&#x27;t know if it is because i use proactiv also, but i also tried not using the Proactiv and washed my face with a regular neutrogena face bar soap and then used this product and my T-Zones were still SO OILY..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using it all together because my face seems to do alot better when using Proactiv, so i dont know what it is.. It says it&#x27;s oil free, but that clearly can&#x27;t be the case because i have dry skin and it still left my face looking oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really have ACNE, i just look for products to cure the dark spots and blemishes on my face mostly to even out my skintone and bring out the beautiful brown that i know i have somewhere deep down inside &#x3D;-).. Oh i also have eczema too by the way if that helps anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to give a Aveeno product a bad review, but this stuff just did not like me or something... Everyone&#x27;s skin is different of course, but i just thought i&#x27;d leave my 2 cents.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and it&#x27;s oily to boot!  This is a great base moisturizer.  I use it at night before bed after washing my face with Cetaphil and in the morning after a quick rinse off of my face and I don&#x27;t have the oily issue, no breakouts and my skin looks more even toned.  Along with a good under eye corrector and I am all set to go!</li>
    <li> Love this product, and with Amazons low prices its a great buy.</li>
    <li> Love the feel of this cream. Its not heavy and does not weigh down the face.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Always love using Aveeno products and it&#x27;s doing me even greater good as it is winter.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and I love this product. I keep re-ordering it. Amazon&#x27;s price is competitive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogeno Oil Free Moisturizer for Combination Skin for the last few years, when I ran out of my latest bottle I thought I&#x27;d try something new. The Neutrogena moisturizer does moisturize well without causing breakouts, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything to help existing breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aveeno&#x27;s Clear Complexion daily moisturizer both moisturizes AND treats my existing breakouts. I&#x27;ve also noticed that my makeup goes on much smoother than it did before. The BIGGEST difference I&#x27;ve noticed is that the Aveeno reduces redness and gives me a more even skin tone, even before I apply makeup! The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s a little thick and gluey - I need about twice as much for my entire face as I did of the Neutrogena, which means I&#x27;ll run out faster (not good for how expensive it is.) But, that&#x27;s a minor gripe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells good too :) I think it smells like flowers.</li>
    <li> It makes your skin softer and does kind of even it out, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything for your acne, helps in absoloutly no way what&#x27;s so ever. But just alone as a moisturizer it is really good!</li>
    <li> I used to use a moisturizer from Yves Rocher but it got too expensive and it was only 1.7 oz.&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing and is much better than what I was using. It makes your skin so soft but yet the acne is kept at bay. I haven&#x27;t had any acne since I have been using this product which is an amazing 2 weeks!&lt;br /&gt;This product is very affordable and I love that it is 4 oz.&lt;br /&gt;I use this moisturizer with the Aveeno Clear Complexion Bar. These 2 products are really great together.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many face lotions but seems like I have to apply more than once to get the effect that I like. With this product all I have to do is apply once and I&#x27;m good for the whole day. Recommend this face lotion its the best!!!</li>
    <li> its good, a little drying to skin, but won&#x27;t cause breakouts</li>
    <li> This product is very natural and calming. It has certainly helped my blemished skin. It isn&#x27;t oily or strong, perfect for day or night use. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been trying to develop a skin care routine and was looking for a good moisturizer.  I have oily acne prone skin and this made my skin burn and break out even worse.  My face is red and dry now because of this.  Cystic acne is not fun to deal with and this brought out too many cysts around my chin and cheeks.  My face was doing great, clearing up before this.  Waste of my money, but I guess it&#x27;s all about trial and error.  I take my time when adding a new product to my skincare routine so that I know if its going to break me out or not,</li>
    <li> The entire Aveeno Clear Complexion line is amazing. This moisturizer in particular is amazing, and I usually can never find it in stores which is why I strictly have to order it on Amazon - which I am not complaining about! This order always arrives literally 2 days after I buy it, and I am in love with how this moisturizer makes my skin feel. I have very sensitive skin with some oily spots and acne..and this cream is perfect after washing my face in the morning and at night. What I love best about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t make my face more oily, and it keeps my skin feeling refreshed even during the summer. Love it!</li>
    <li> I am AMAZED at how fast and how well this moisturizer worked. It dissolves quickly, and the scent is not too powerful. My skin looks healthy, radiant, and flawless. I probably wouldn&#x27;t suggest using this if you have serious acne because there is not very much salicylic acid in it. I would however suggest using this if you suffer from the occasional break out or pimple. This product will do wonders at keeping your skin blemish free. I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and I have no problem useing this every day. Shipping was fast. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I like this lotion. It moisturizers but I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month (on second bottle) but no big overall difference in fading spots. Have a large one on side of cheek that didn&#x27;t change at all. Oh well, I really wanted to believe Jennifer Anniston. I&#x27;ll continue to use it because it is a great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> it didnt clear my face up.. but it does moisturize. I do have been having new blemishes while using this product but I kinda do feel it keeps my face hydrated. I wish it had SPF though</li>
    <li> No other moisturizer keeps me oil-free while providing moisture to my skin.  I don&#x27;t want to imagine what my skin would look like without this stuff.  It helps a little with acne, as well.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and I must say this is one of the better moisturizers I&#x27;ve come across.  Yes, better than the most expensive name brands.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily on my t-zone area and moisturizes just enough to feel smooth on face.  Does not feel heavy like other moisturizers or lotions.  This is a great buy.</li>
    <li> Not as fast acting as I wanted. Will continue to use it until finish.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I USE THIS UNDER MY MAKE-UP.  IT&#x27;S A GREAT MOISTURIZER AND SOAKS IN AND DOESN&#x27;T &amp;#34;LAY&amp;#34; ON YOUR SKIN.  IT&#x27;S A WONDERFUL PRODUCT.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
    <li> It feels good, smells good, and my skin in less dry.  No pimples.  Good product.  I will continue to buy!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but not very moisturizing, maybe I don&#x27;t use enough. I needed something without SPF and this is what I chose.</li>
    <li> This is the only moisturizer that I will use as it is the perfect balance of moisture and thickness. Many moisturizers I tried left my skin feeling dry hours after or caused breakouts, but not this one. I use this daily after showers and it continues to be my skin&#x27;s best friend. Wouldn&#x27;t go anywhere without it.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It&#x27;s not greasy even in the summer time yet my face feels moisterized. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is absolutely terrible. Because of it my face is now covered in pimples, whereas before I only had a few. At first my skin cleared up after using it. However, after a few more days, I noticed my skin was getting worst and worst. I was thinking about stopping but I thought that that was how it was suppose to work so I kept on using it. Well by Week 3, my skin was just disgusting. I would post pictures of before and after of my face but this website does not allow me to do that. Anyways DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! TRUST ME IT DOESNT WORK, IT JUST MAKES YOUR SKIN WORST. Most of the positive reviews for this product are fake and just written by the sellers/ company themself. Also dont buy the foaming cleanser for this product, its equally bad.</li>
    <li> Works well on all types of skin, is not oily and has a very light scent. A great sunscreen year round to protect and moisturize your skin. Perfect for my face.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I&#x27;ve been using Aveeno Clear Complexion Moisturizer for over a year now and I will never use a different moisturizer again. I have problematic skin with blemishes and this product has helped clear my completion. this lotion feels amazing. My skin looks and feels 10x better!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
    <li> I’ve had acne my whole life.  As a teenager I was medicated with every topical treatment and antibiotic combination possible and then went on Acutane when I was 18.  My twenties and my thirties have seen some flare-ups (though nothing as serious as my teenage years).  To combat these, I’ve tried many different moisturizers/topical treatments.  I was using Eminence Clear Skin Probiotic Moisturizer ($35/2 oz) prior to trying this and the moment I switched, my acne cleared and has been clear ever since.  This is the best moisturizer I’ve ever tried and works amazingly for me (although there is certainly no guarantee it will work for everyone).  The only drawback I find is that it does not contain SPF.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer.  It doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out.  It&#x27;s light and not heavy.  Perfect for daily wear!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over 6 years, best moisturizer for my skin type (combination, acne prone). Aveeno is great!!</li>
    <li> I use face moisturizer every day and this is a great one to use.  It is made with soy and I love the smell of it as I put it on my face.  It leaves a nice clean feeling on my face.  The only disadvantage is that it does not have any sun protection in it.....many moisturizers have a little bit of sun protection.  But this is a small price to pay for this natural and clean moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Only problem with this is when it comes to end pump stops working though it has 10-15% of cream left.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is amazing!  I am an 18 yr/old female with oily skin, and I use this every night and most mornings, too.  My skin has cleared significantly from this product.  I love my skin now because it is so soft and my problem areas have faded away. :)  Would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> I have used dozens of products, the cheapo and the good stuff, and I found one may help some of the dry skin but by the end of the day I&#x27;d end up with a whitehead somewhere on my face. So I&#x27;d tough it out without moisturizers to avoid the stubborn pimples...until this stuff. just a little pump once a day after my shower and I&#x27;m good. Excellent product, recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing moisturizer!! My skin type: sensitive and on the oily side. After use of this moisturizer, my face becomes really smooth which was the first thing I noticed. It also stays that way for many hours and although my face is usually oily, it doesn&#x27;t get TOO oily like other moisturizers I used prior to this one. My face looks quite radiant after use as well. It seems like my face is brightening up a bit daily now. Though, it&#x27;s only been a week so I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;ll last..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what I&#x27;d really like to say about this product is that it seems to help acne. I have terrible acne. It&#x27;s not a pimple here and there that people normally get. I used to be acne and pimple free till I was about 18 years old; then the outbreaks started happening lol. Anyways, my point is that whatever I tried for my acne never helped. It could be the herbs I&#x27;m drinking along with facials I do nowadays, but I think this moisturizer helped out too. It definitely helped calm down a lot of blemishes I have so my face isn&#x27;t as red as it used to be. Also, I&#x27;m clearing up a little which is amazing progress as for almost 3 years, my acne has just gotten worse over time. Give this product a try even though it might be on the pricey side!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Aveeno. I tried another moisturizer for a month and I broke out like crazy. Bought this again, and now my face is so much clearer. Not to mention, it&#x27;s about $4 cheaper on here than if it was store-bought.</li>
    <li> This product has worked well for my skin with it&#x27;s occasional break-outs.  However, I checked and was sorry to learn that Aveeno products are animal tested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Putting chemicals in the eyes of living animals, etc., is simply not necessary in today&#x27;s world; and I will not continue to purchase this product; in spite of how much I like it, due to Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s continued use of animal testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m changing to Burt&#x27;s Bees similar products for sensitive skin and acne  (with salicylic acid) items.</li>
    <li> Our late teens and early 20 somethings love this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love this face lotion</li>
    <li> Great for skin discoloration. I use it after the Aveeno  bright scrub wash and it does wonders for my complexion.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 2 years. I have very oily skin and suffer from some breakouts. My skin tone was very uneven and rough and had some slight acne scarring before using this product. Since using I have seen a definite inprovement. My skin tone is even and looks healthy and glowing and it has reduced acne and acne scarring. I use as a night cream because there is no spf and must use consistently to see improvement.</li>
    <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve been using for many years... nothing else works as well. Gentle and great for acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Aveeno. It&#x27;s just so expensive and lately in stores they are smaller bottles. I am so happy with the price I paid and the size of this bottle. It really makes a difference especially in Cali where are weather is bi-polar and it&#x27;s 59 one day and 90 the next haha.</li>
    <li> I added this product to my skincare regimen hoping that I had finally found a good moisturizer for sensitive skin. After several weeks using the product every morning along with the Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Cleansing Pads, I have seen no improvement in my skin&#x27;s clarity. I have always had a problem with little breakouts here and there, but never with the large under-the-surface pimples that started appearing on my face. Ouch! After I stopped using the lotion my skin started clearing up again. The lotion itself is a great moisturizer and is not heavy at all. The fragrance was also very light and pleasant. I would certainly have continued using the product if it weren&#x27;t for the fact that it just didn&#x27;t agree with my skin. I will continue to use Aveeno&#x27;s cleansing pads as they work wonderfully, but I will be looking for another moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have been battling with pimples for years.  I&#x27;ve tried neutrogena, proactive,and olay to name a few.  None of these solved my problem.  I have only been using Aveeno for three weeks and I am so happy to say that I have no pimples!  That has never happened before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 12 year old son has been using it as well, and the pimples are almost all gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are so happy to have clear skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We love Aveeno!!!</li>
    <li> I was lookingfor Almay face complexion lotion.</li>
    <li> Eh, Oily skin and I get pimple using this on my face at night after shower.</li>
    <li> Aveen Clear Complexion is the first moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used, and I have to say it did not disappoint. I&#x27;ve never used many products to improve my skin, but I will definitely keep this in my stash now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never had problem skin in high school, but once I hit college I just started having a lot of breakouts from high stress and poor eating habits. I finally found a daily facial wash that worked well and didn&#x27;t completely dry out my skin (causing me to break out more!), but the combination of new skin wash and this moisturizer are what ultimately cleared up my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more redness, and I&#x27;ve had one breakout in the last two weeks since using this. It really makes your skin look even and clear!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have been using it for a few years now as it works very well for my type of complexion, i.e. combination skin (dry patches, oily T-zone and aging/mature skin).  It goes on smoothly and is absorbed quickly with no shine after application or hours later.  I have also found that it imparts better tone and clarity too.  It works even better with the Aveeno Clear Complexion scrub.  I will continue to use this facial moisturizer and would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I usually break out in the summer. I sweat a lot while gardening and my pores get clogged, especially on my forehead. Since, I&#x27;ve change my skin regimen, my breakouts have been minimal to nil. Here is what I do. 1) Wash my face morning and night, 2) Use witch hazel pads, and then 3) finish off with this moisturizer. I always thought washing my skin too much would dry it out, but it&#x27;s just fine, and most importantly - pimple-free. Since I am now using this moisturizer as part of my regimen, I guess I will give this product some of the credit. I just re-ordered.</li>
    <li> My skin was relatively clear except for some acne on my jawline. I had been using Neutrogena Rapid Tone Repair Night Moisturizer and it was working wonders. I switched to this product when I noticed the Neutrogena Moisturizer wasn&#x27;t reducing the jawline acne as much as I wanted and I wanted to try a less expensive night time moisturizer since my face had mostly balanced out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrible mistake! I stuck with this product for about a week, to at least give it a chance, but the acne became increasingly worse! Eventually with 5-7 new break outs a day! I stopped and switch back to my Neutrogena Moisturizer, however, the acne this moisturizer caused left me with damaged skin. It&#x27;s been about a week and a half since I used Aveeno Clear Complexion and I my face is just starting to lose the large, red post-pimple marks. The Aveeno Clear Complexion, during the week of use, caused my pores to become larger and release a lot of oil throughout the day. I&#x27;m switching back to Neutrogena Rapid Tone Repair.</li>
    <li> Love it! First lotion I have used that didn&#x27;t clog my pores!</li>
    <li> This is a great everyday light moisturizer for acne prone teens.  My daughter spends a lot of money on acne products and I&#x27;m a huge fan of Aveeno brand.  I got her to try this and so far so good!  The only issue I have is that you can find it less expensive at other stores when they&#x27;re having a sales event.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this does anything for taking away zits or blemishes, but it is a good moisturizer that I don&#x27;t worry about clogging my pores (maybe I should, but I don&#x27;t seem to get breakouts when I use it). It isn&#x27;t oily and it absorbs quickly into the skin, but still leaves your face feeling good for at least a few hours on a dry wintery day. Good enough for me!</li>
    <li> All i can say this cream is a life saver!!!! I&#x27;m so glad i bought it a few months ago (i&#x27;m using the second bottle now) i&#x27;ve had acne prone skin in the past 3years and nothing helped me except this product!</li>
    <li> BEST moisturizer out there! I absolutely love the scent and the texture. It&#x27;s soo soft and leaves your skin so moisturized, and at the same time it helps prevent breakouts and also helps fight acne scars. I love this moisturizer</li>
    <li> my holy grale!! can&#x27;t live without it !!</li>
    <li> Good product; non-greasy lotion helps my dry skin.</li>
    <li> My favorite moisturizer, ever since I started using this over two years ago my face has been clearer than ever!</li>
    <li> Been using it for a couple of weeks and so far it&#x27;s good 👍</li>
    <li> very good buy I started using it and I can feel the difference. I am happy I buy it and I will get more</li>
    <li> I think my skin is about as sensitive as the next person. I get very oily around my t zone and i have huge pores that you can actually see from a mile away but my skin is pretty clear although it does have its own bumps here and there. I get a few pimples once in a while and other than my t zone my whole face gets really dry. I decided to get aveeno clear complexion daily moisturizer because I wanted something gentle enough for everyday usage and keep my skin clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really happy when i put on the product because my face felt really soft and smooth. I thought this was the product for me. Within three to four days my face started to develop red spots all over. I stopped using the product and my face cleared up again. I decided to give the product another try as I have spent $14 on the bottle. Again the spots appear. Needless to say this was not the product for me.</li>
    <li> The only face lotion I can use! All others will make my skin flaky and/or dry. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best this I&#x27;ve tried, It just a week much clearer skin. This worked better then clean &amp; clear, and proactiv. I use this as the 3rd step to aveeno clear complexion face wash and the clear complexion astringent. It cost a little more then others but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s while worth it!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. Best rates yet through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin so I&#x27;m very careful with products that I choose. I like this face lotion because it goes on smooth, no heavy, oily or watery feeling, and it feels just right! Also, I am usually pretty sensitive to Salicylic Acid but for some reason it doesn&#x27;t bother me with this lotion. I think it&#x27;s the Aveeno brand, they are great with my skin type, which is why I keep coming back to them. I use it daily, sometimes twice a day, I just love the way it feels! I ran out once and had to use a different brand for a couple of days and my skin returned to its evil ways. I never want to run out again. I will be subscribing to this item for sure!!!</li>
    <li> I like the aveeno bleat complexion with the soy. It helps to keep my complexion good and fade away some dark spots.</li>
    <li> I really love the aveeno clear complexion facial cleanser,  I think it&#x27;s a perfect product in preventing acne as well as improving overall skin I use it everyday. However, sadly this stuff isn&#x27;t that good. It&#x27;s way to thick so putting it on feels  messy and like your asking for acne. Most importantly it breaks me out. Would recommend you find another moisturizer and just use the cleanser because it&#x27;s actually a really effective product unlike this which may also give you breakouts in trade for better complexion</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for at least 6 months and have no problem with it! It clears up my acne, moisturizes my face, and makes it looks even, clear, and wonderful. I&#x27;d be very upset if this product was discontinued! I love it more than any other product I use. It doesn&#x27;t even make me break out! Its PERFECT for me!</li>
    <li> I use the facewash that goes with this, too. Both are great. Now my face looks and feels super smooth.</li>
    <li> I think this product works really well for what it says it does!&lt;br /&gt;Only problem is I stopped using this to use another product&lt;br /&gt;because my acne started getting better )not sure if it was due to this,&lt;br /&gt;most likely this with combo of new face wash)&lt;br /&gt;recommended, &amp; love that it doesnt smell too strong, like many other acne meds</li>
    <li> Thus stuff works wonders on my face! My face cleared up in about a week or so.</li>
    <li> Very thick in texture and not moisturizing. And... it makes me breaks out! There&#x27;s no such a thing called purging when using facial products over the counter so please be aware when a product make you break out more. That&#x27;s just not for you.</li>
    <li> I used to use this moisturizer and stopped a few months ago because of how expensive it is &amp; I didn&#x27;t think it was really making a difference for my skin. But my face has been nothing but broken out since I stopped using it...I ordered some last week on Amazon &amp; have used it twice daily since then and already see an improvement in my facial skin&#x27;s texture, color, and even reduced breakouts! Will buy again - it&#x27;s definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> Good quality, very good product!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin that has all kinds of issues. I just started using this to try and help with some of the break outs and other issues so far I really like it. I love Aveeno products.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin kind of dry and red</li>
    <li> moisturizing &amp; fragrance are meet my expected. I am using the product now, and expect its moisture in the coming dry Spring season.</li>
    <li> The fact that I&#x27;m still using this product speaks for itself.  I use it everyday especially in 32 degree weather which has a tendency to make your skin dry.  I like the subtle fragrance too.</li>
    <li> My friend recommended this moisturizer especially for winter months when my skin has been seemingly extra dry.  The moisturizer is the perfect amount of moisturizing without feeling too heavy.  I usually use Clean &amp; Clear salicylic daily moisturizer and this has proven to be just like it in that it doesn&#x27;t cause me to breakout but gives me more moisture.</li>
    <li> we live in a dry state and this product cleared teen acne and keeps her skin moist. great product will continue to buy</li>
    <li> I have struggled with chronic acne for years, and I&#x27;ve come to learn that high quality moisturizers are just as important as powerful topical treatments. I&#x27;ve been using Aveeno Clear Complexion twice daily for the past year, and my skin looks healthier than ever. The cream has a light, clean consistency that applies smoothly and doesn&#x27;t clog pours. The salicylic acid works to gently exfoliate dead skin and even out tone. Benzoyl peroxide dries skin too much to be used 24/7, but I&#x27;ve found this product to be gentle enough to apply every day and night for maintenance. Is this an Rx treatment replacement? Not really. But for clear, healthy skin, it works just as well as much more expensive moisturizers I&#x27;ve been given by dermatologists. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Fair level of moisturizing for acne prone skin. Not a big fan of the scent, but so far it hasn&#x27;t shown to be an issue in the breakout factor. Good product.</li>
    <li> It has done a really good job keeping my skin hydrated and i have noticed a decrease in breakouts since using this product.&lt;br /&gt;It hasn&#x27;t fully prevented my breakouts but i think it helps.</li>
    <li> Aveeno Clear Complexion works great! I use it before applying cover-up powder, and it helps the powder coverage last all day. I have not experienced any breakouts from this product.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer. It helps keep breakouts under control and doesn&#x27;t cause over-drying like a lot of acne moisturizers do. Of course from time to time you will have some acne popup but overall it has reduced the occurrences. The only thing I wish it had was an SPF to protect against the harsh sun.</li>
    <li> I like this moisturizer. It keeps your skin feeling hydrated. Im not sure how clear its keeping my complexion but the lotion is very light weight and not oily. Feels good under my make up as well.</li>
    <li> I first started using this moisturizer after a road trip... experiencing such varying climates in such a short amount of time really made my acne flair up... Before this, I had been using the neutrogena moisturizer for sensitive skin, which seemed to make my face really greasy. I decided to give this stuff a try after reading some reviews and finding it on sale somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really noticed a different in the redness. It helped to calm my skin down and made the redness a lot less noticeable. My face has some pretty bad acne and scarring, especially before trying this moisturizer. It really evened out my skin tone (though it still has a way to go, I try to be thankful for how much better it&#x27;s gotten).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This never makes my face feel greasy and absorbs well. I like the scent and consistency. Salicylic acid has never been effective on my acne, and I don&#x27;t think the very small amount of salicylic acid in this product did anything for me. I really think it was the soy that helped even out my skin tone and get rid of redness. Before this product, I would see my reflection in low-light situations and think that my skin looked like swiss cheese or something. I felt like there were craters in my face from the scars and redness, and this product totally changed that. Unfortunately, my face still has a way to go before it&#x27;s scar-free and although this product really helped me see a difference, it now seems like my face has kind of gotten used to it and it&#x27;s done being beneficial. It hasn&#x27;t made it worse compared to any other moisturizer, but I&#x27;ve been breaking out more since repurchased it after my first bottle ran out. I do still really like this stuff, though. It&#x27;s the best moisturizer that I&#x27;ve tried on my skin, which is pretty dry and sensitive but was very oily in high school.</li>
    <li> I need this all the time to prevent my face from getting dry and  cracked.  I always use it many times a day and get good results.</li>
    <li> Aveeno has got the moisture formula down. Not greasy, feels light, smells fresh.</li>
    <li> My favorite moisturizer for the past few years!</li>
    <li> I started using this product a month ago, and it caused more acne on the sides of my cheek and forehead. White heads, black heads, and caused acne scars to appear darker than they usually would. I read similar reviews and immediately stopped using it. Will probably go back to Positively Radiant line.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and I get no issue with this product.  I use this daily.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I was so in love with the Aveeno Daily Moisturizer Stress Relief with Lavender. This second Aveeno product did not let me down at all.&lt;br /&gt;It is a very good moisturizer for the face. It absorbs very fast and I don&#x27;t feel any sticky or oily at all, unlike the previous brands I used in the past. My skin feels soft and smooth for the whole day. Perfect for cold days when my face skin was starting to peel :(&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth the price. I would recommend this product to my friends :)</li>
    <li> Aveeno must be paying people to write these reviews saying that this product works.  I have been using this for about three weeks and I see no diffrence in helping fade dark spots.  Like another reviewer said it acually caused terrible cystic acne for me.  Save your money and go with Neutrogena.  They have better products.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a couple of days, so cannot speak to how it clears your complexion or not. However, I like it a great deal - it goes on smoothly, no burning or itching, and seems to protect your skin from the elements. It also smells very neutral, but nice.</li>
    <li> Pore-clogging crap. Check cosdna or makeupalley for reviews.</li>
    <li> My favorite moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I like this lotion, it seems to help.</li>
    <li> I love this and use it every day. The pump is perfect and lets out the right amount. My skin gets very dry and oily and I highly suggest this item to moisturize and it is not oily at all.</li>
    <li> My 19 year old daughter uses this product daily to moisturize her face.  She really loves it and highly recommends it.</li>
    <li> good product NOT greasy &amp; seems to soak in on face</li>
    <li> I really love this moisturizer!  I goes on really smooth and soaks right into your face with no oily residue or sticky feeling, I use it daily under my makeup and really love it.</li>
    <li> I tried the \\&quot;Postively Radiant\\&quot; Aveeno line, and it was nice, but didn&#x27;t have the right amount of acne medication for me. Then I switched to the \\&quot;Clear Complexion\\&quot; line and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference after just a few days. My skin is already brighter and clearer! I still have a few pimples here and there, but I&#x27;m going to see what this product can do after I&#x27;ve been using it a few weeks. So far, so good!</li>
    <li> I know the product well and was looking for best price.  Price was just okay but with delivery charges, the savings wasn&#x27;t worth it.  Will probably buy in store moving forward.</li>
    <li> Tried it for two weeks: I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my face and it was a little thick when applied. It also leaves a slight sheen that I don&#x27;t care for. I&#x27;m sure the 0.5 Salicylic Acid is good for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years It is really light weight and has a SPF Protection factor which is really nice it. For the price it is ten times better then name brand moisturizers and there is no perfumie scent added or nothing</li>
    <li> Love it,  had been using this stuff for years,  only moisturizer I will use.</li>
    <li> Makes skin feel so soft.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing! I have been using this lotion for about 2-3 years now and I absolutely love it! My face is so soft and clear and just great! My face is naturally really dry and this lotion is absolutely perfect for me and my sister who&#x27;s face is naturally greasy. It keeps me moisturized while not over moisturizing hers! :)</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is the ONLY moisturizer that won&#x27;t break out my skin!  Goes on smooth.  Very light and non-greasy feeling.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a year now and if I wash my face and forget to put my moisturizer on, I can really feel the difference!  I have oily skin and this moisturizer seems to control it some.  I&#x27;m just glad that this stuff doesn&#x27;t make me break out in a bunch of zits!  I wish there was an SPF in it though.  I tried the Aveeno Positively Radiant Skin with SPF 15 and it unfortunately makes my skin break out a little.  It&#x27;s a bit thicker and does leave a slight greasy feeling on my skin.  Guess I&#x27;ll just have to wear a hat to protect my face from the sun!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 34 years old and still get random acne.  This is still moisturizing but also has help with mild pimples or bumps.  I&#x27;m VERY sensitive to smells for face cream and hate oily or thick on my face.  This smells really good and is very light.  Smooths my skin and feels great.  I use it every day.  Highly recommended from someone very picky with face creams.</li>
    <li> this product and the soap clear complexion..both super!!!!before im using these,used those expensive cream but then my face full of pimple and blackheads...I saw this in grocery outlet for 4.99 so I grab it..i wash my face with aveeno soap,at first my face was so dry but I like it bcoz I wanted to remove my dead skin so I continue using it for 2 months now I notice my face clear,fair tone,no more acne,or even tiny bump...im so happy..i wont change anything..i love this stuff..plus the price is good...</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but this product just cleared up acne, blemishes, every little mishap on my face and I&#x27;m left simply glowing. Trust me.......I have used so many products and finally gave up. Then I saw aveeno and just decided to get it on a whim. The final result........I&#x27;m sticking to this product without a doubt.</li>
    <li> This is a great facial moisturizer and blemish fighter. The price seems steep but this stuff lasts a long time! I use it once a day (wash with trader joes face wash and then apply) and it lasts me about 3 months! You only need to use one pump- no need to overdo as it spreads easily across your face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry skin and the occasional breakout this stuff is the best. Someone actually commented how great my face looked.</li>
    <li> I have oily, acne prone skin (which also tends to get red and irritated). Combined with some other moisturizers, I have found a decent balance for my skin, so I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer, not too thick. One squirt is enough to cover your face. The smell is ok too. Would maybe try again.</li>
    <li> Aveeno Clear complex ruin keeps my face moisturizer without feeling oily I&#x27;ve used this moisturizer for the past 2 years and I know my clear skin is due to this lotion.</li>
    <li> Great go to product. Would benefit if formula was a little less heavy+lighter (there is a difference and this needs a reduction in both areas). The quality makes it worth the price, and fixing it a little bit would make sales soar. We buy this Aveeno, and it&#x27;s ok. We just don&#x27;t go back because even though the quality makes the price fair, it needs to do more to make the price payable.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> I brought this as a last resort because I was waiting for an oil free moisturizer in the mail.This stuff is just way too oily. It claims to be oil free yet it just sits on your face &amp; doesn&#x27;t moisturizer &amp; just makes my combo skin have that SHINY effect that I hate. &amp; my cheeks would flake ...so it&#x27;s too oily AND not moisturizing enough? mehh idkk...since I brought it I thought I may as well just use it all &amp; I did &amp; I guess I have to admit it got better over time but I&#x27;ll stick to African black soap ...it&#x27;s literally an ALL in one cleanser,toner,moisturizer! Amazing...this stuff is a dud -__- not for me (acne/oily/dry skin)</li>
    <li> a friend had given me a small sample of this before, and I could never find it in stores, found it here on Amazon, and it came in shorter time than expected and it&#x27;s great! I use it every morning after i&#x27;ve cleaned my face and skin has cleared up, and is much more toned</li>
    <li> The case for the product was damaged and opened. It don&#x27;t look like new to me.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the only daily facial lotion that works for me. It&#x27;s soft and light, but balances my skin&#x27;s oily/dry complexion and prevents acne. I love that a little goes a long way! The bottle is perfect for traveling!</li>
    <li> I like this moisturizer because it&#x27;s light and helps with the complexion, it also has SPF and protects the sun.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this since I was about 22, about 10 years ago.  I use it only nightly, as I find it too greasy for daytime wear.  When I use it faithfully at night, I find that no matter what I am using in the AM (now a clinique gel) that my skin is clearer and evener than when I don&#x27;t use it.  The price is affordable here, and in general, compared to other lotions that are of good quality.  I have tried many more expensive products but this works the best to keep my skin clear, without drying it.  My skin is prone to dryness and redness and I use this along with the aveeno calming cleanser and I don&#x27;t use anything else on my face at night.</li>
    <li> Aveeno always makes great products and this is one of them. I have been using this moisturizer for some time now. My skin is naturally oily and quite prone to acne. I tried to switch to another moisturizer but it ended with my acne being aggravated.&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer is great as it keep my facial skin moist and keeps my acne somewhat under control. Though a little expensive I think the product is worth the money.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes just as well as any other Aveeno facial lotion - no complaints there, I love Aveeno&#x27;s products. Have been using this for a couple weeks and saw only a slight improvement in my complexion - at least I don&#x27;t get huge pimples as much as I did before using this lotion. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone with mild acne issues or infrequent break-outs, and to anyone who just wants a great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer. Never left my skin too oily, and slight change in complexion for the better.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash so much. It&#x27;s really the only thing that works for me. As a licensed cosmetologist who works in the skin industry I have spent years and tons of money trying any professional product I could get my hands on. Nothing works better for my skin then this.</li>
    <li> My skin is great. I never breakout and my skin usually doesn&#x27;t give me problems, but lately my skin became red and dry. I could literally peel skin off of my face. Especially on my nose and around my glasses. I tried facial moisturizers, but they were so greasy and they did NOTHING for my dry skin. Then, I got some money for my birthday so i decided to go to the CVS and get something nice for myself. In addition to the foaming cleanser, I got this great product. I honestly bought it because it said clear complexion and I thought it might fix the redness as long as my dry sin.&lt;br /&gt;I was so happy when I first tried this. I was so excited to see if it would work that i put it on in my car, and even then i could feel it was good for my skin. IT MOISTURIZED WITHOUT A GREASY FEEL, which I was beginning to feel was impossible. I tried everything, even Mary Kay, but it was so greasy it made my perfect skin break out and burn! This is great. I totally recommend it. If it can moisturize my skin it can fix anyone&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> One of the best face moisturizer. Non-oily and keeps your face moisturized all day.</li>
    <li> I hate lotions because it makea me feel like i have something on my face and some will make me break out as well.  Nothing I found made my face feel clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried various different types (both expensive name brands and not so expensive ones from drug stores and other retail) and hadn&#x27;t found one I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, i found aveeno face scrub wash worked really well with my skin, and decided to give this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;I can say, I have finally found something that i can wear without the weight or the break out.  I think i will be using this for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m soooooo glad to have found this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;It makes me feel refreshed without all the weight nor the breakout.</li>
    <li> After finding the Aveeno scrub I mentioned (in another review) how it can dry out your skin without some kind of face moisturizer. Well, I looked into the same brand (Aveeno) and tried out this product. Within days my the skin on my cheeks felt like a babies butt! With both the Aveeno scrub and this lotion my skin (on my face) has been very healthy and soft. I recommend this product to those with very sensitive skin because it doesn&#x27;t have all the extra ingredients that some products such as proactive or neutrogena has. It is just a very simple basic face lotion that makes your skin soft and healthy. So if you have sensitive, dry skin this is definitely worth trying.</li>
    <li> My skin breaks out if I even say the word pimple so I have to be very careful about what I use. This helps keep my outbreaks to a minimum. I also have &amp;#34;more mature&amp;#34; skin so a good moisturizer is important. This product is moisturizing without being greasy. It&#x27;s really the perfect balance for temperamental skin like mine. I&#x27;ve spent a ton on pricey face creams but this one gives the others a run for their money!</li>
    <li> This was the first face lotion I have ever used until it was absolutely empty. I love this stuff, great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love aveeno products. For some reason this is what keeps acne off my face. Everyone is different so I&#x27;m not saying it will do the same for everyone. I have mild acne w. Flare UPS on my chin area. This keeps it away. I still occasionally get one or two on my cheek but they are not sore like they usually were and they go away faster. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is that I still will get one or two sometimes but that&#x27;s being extra picky. My acne has improved drastically.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is, but whenever I put this lotion on at night, I wake up with clear, clean, matte skin. It&#x27;s liquid magic. Seriously, buy it.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin smooth and I notice a brightening effect as well as a subtle diminish of dark spots. Can&#x27;t say it helps prevent breakouts and it does make my oily skin oilier on my nose (my biggest oil problem spot) so I stopped using it there. Otherwise, no issues and I like it.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin due to rosacea and breakouts but this lotion has helped my skin get clear and feel smooth! Love the way it smells too!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product and another Aveeno product (Daily Scrub) for about two weeks now. This product does what I wanted it to do and that is to moisturize my face. I liked the idea of having a facial moisturizer that would also help keep my skin clear... However, I have not yet noticed a difference in my breakouts. I don&#x27;t have bad acne at all, I just break out a few days every month and I was hoping something like this would take care of that. I&#x27;m going to continue to use this product and I hope it starts working eventually. Even if it doesn&#x27;t start clearing up my few minor breakouts I am going to use it because I like how it doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily feeling and I can apply foundation on top of it and it doesn&#x27;t just make the foundation sit on my face and be noticeable like other facial moisturizers I&#x27;ve used in the past. I also like that this product has a very mild scent. As with the daily scrub, I use this twice a day, after my morning shower and after I wash my face when I get home from work. I love that I can use both products twice a day and not have to worry about my skin drying out.</li>
    <li> This cream is NOT oily. It&#x27;s the only moisturizer i can use that DOESN&#x27;T make my face shiny or clog my pores. It also helps with my breakouts around my mouth/chin area when i combine it with CeraVe hydrating cleanser at night and in the morning. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and still keeps it smooth and hydrated even in the winter months. Highly Recommend!</li>
    <li> This is the only face lotion that works for me, no sticky feel at all. It lasts all day and i no longer get any break-outs.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! Makes my skin glow and keeps the acne away!! Very moisturizing too! Use it everyday and the price is perfect for the product that you get!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Can&#x27;t do without it! The only face moisturizer I&#x27;m able to use that doesn&#x27;t cause pimples</li>
    <li> nice and thick moisturizer, but the cap gets stuck at times.</li>
    <li> Great for my skin, soft scent and makes my face so soft.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and i do get breakouts often. For few weeks, I have been using neutrogena Oil free acne wash followed by aveeno cc daily moisturizer and i have no breakouts now. The moisturizer is fast absorbing, makes ur skin smooth and even. Its a good winter moisturizer for ur skin but no guarantee regarding the sunscreen effect.</li>
    <li> i LOVE this moisturizer. It is thick enough that i can get proper coverage for just a small amount. It absorbs very quickly and does not feel heavy or oily. I will put this on in the morning and be good all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main issue before using this moisturizer was my forehead would dry out in the winter and would have skin flakes. It was particuarly bad after i got out of the shower. Now i just put this on and my skin is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this with a combination of cetaphil in the shower and i rarely EVER break out. My skin is very soft and looks amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this is kinda pricey. But a little will go along way. Any more that one squirt and you have too much. So that bottle will last a good while. If you are in doubt, BUY THIS!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a moisturizer that I could put on in the morning and wear all day. I only put this on at night because it&#x27;s too heavy to wear during the day and makes my face sweat (gross).&lt;br /&gt;But it has completely taken care of the dry skin around my nose and mouth so it is a good moisturizing product</li>
    <li> Love how it feels and smell.  Males my face looks matte</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this moisturizer. I am in my early 20s and no longer have a big issue with adolescent acne. I wanted to switch to a moisturizer that would be easier on my skin (I previously and again use [[ASIN:B000052YJM Clean &amp; Clear ESSENTIALS Dual Action Moisturizer, 4 Ounce]]). However, after using this for 3 days, my face broke out with 10-15 small pimples in between my eye brows, on both cheeks and on my chin.  This is just so disappointing from Aveeno. I&#x27;m still not quite sure why my skin reacted like this but I won&#x27;t be using or purchasing this moisturizer again.</li>
    <li> I like it, but it can be a little dry</li>
    <li> i used this before and it&#x27;s very light but works. my skin feels soft. i have very sensitive skin, this doesn&#x27;t upset my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. It is very moisturizing and the salicylic acid is an added bonus. Still have some acne but it still helps more than other moisturizers.</li>
    <li> I apply this daily under my makeup and again at night.  It cleared up my facial eczema within days.  Absolutely thrilled.</li>
    <li> Was fine at first but now I have redness and am allergic reaction. I had to throw it away.</li>
    <li> this product is AWFUL. I used it only one night and it broke my face out big time. I can&#x27;t believe i wasted money on this</li>
    <li> Works great for my acne prone sensitive skin . I use the clear complexion face wash as well.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer, but caused me to break out. had to stop using it. I think that Neutrogena is a better product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product for combination/acne prone skin. Light daily moisturizer that provides just enough moisture without making your skin appear oily anytime of day!</li>
    <li> Good every day moisturizer for my t zone!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I feel it works better for my oily 35 year old skin than more expensive brand.</li>
    <li> I love this facial moisturizer. It helps keep my skin clear and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin either. Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for years and it works for my skin.</li>
    <li> I am very happy so far.. bought this for my teenage daughter.  Seems to be helping and keeping the acne from getting worse.</li>
