      <li>I originally felt that this product was really great and \\&quot;natural\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>In fact, the way that I found Aveeno was on my continual quest to get the best shave by trying new products.&lt;br</li>

      <li>i will and have repurchased many times.</li>

      <li>It provides a nice, smooth shave.</li>
      <li>The gel is very soothing on my skin, and it gives me a great shave.  </li>
      <li>LOVE THIS STUFF</li>
      <li>Your razors are way better than ours</li>
      <li>That aside the stuff is fantastic!</li>
      <li>Have tried many shave creams and gels...</li>
      <li>because now I don&#x27;t have to leave my house and can buy as many of these as I want.</li>
      <li>I was told that that using this shaving gel would be a fantastic experience!</li>
      <li>Your skin will feel better too.</li>
      <li>Works way better than the stuff I bought at the health food stores.</li>
      <li>Seems I am not the first one!!!  </li>
      <li>Otherwise it works pretty good</li>
      <li>It is wasteful (but you use the product more quickly so then you have to buy another can!</li>
      <li>You can try Aveeno&#x27;s better smelling alternative shave cream called Positively Smooth.  </li>
      <li>great for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>consistently the best shaving creamor sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I guess I can say I&#x27;ve tried every form of pre/post shaving conditioner available at most retail outlets, e.g., gels, creams, foams, bars, lotions, and so on.</li>
      <li>True!</li>
      <li>I will never use any other shave gel again, this stuff is great!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, it smells like oatmeal with vanilla...</li>
      <li>Emphasis on TOO QUICKLY!</li>
      <li>For Amazon to have this product available, it simply makes it great</li>
      <li>I was using Aveeno \\&quot;Positively Smooth Shave</li>
      <li>Fortunately, it did not go into my eyes.  </li>
      <li>aveeno, cheap way to make money.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Aveeno, fragrance free lotion</li>
      <li>I am bio free.</li>
      <li>I have had no razor bumps using this gel, and it leaves my skin moisturized and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I bought this a few months ago at Wal-Mart, and I am impressed.</li>
      <li>We moved to another country which do not have any Aveeno brand available</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Edge, Gillette, and Nivea shaving gels over the years and all versions are far superior in performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Now that I am finished with all 4 bottles of shaving gel, I bought some of my old brand Gillette shaving gel, smells really good.  </li>
      <li>Saw it was available again, and started using it again, since the CVS version, while good, wasn&#x27;t quite the same.  </li>
      <li>But they acted as if they&#x27;ve never heard of this (which honestly, I can&#x27;t believe), and would internally relay my problem to the appropriate group.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving my head on a daily basis for years, and so it is really important for me to get good shaving materials.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Smells simply clean, not chemically.  </li>
      <li>It gives a clean, close, moisturizing shave.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t have many positive things to say about it.    </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s modestly priced, unscented, brushless, gives perfect lubrication and cushioning, softens the hairs, and leaves your skin feeling unaffected.</li>
      <li>I used to really like Edge gel, and believe me that this stuff is about three times better than Edge.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I hope Aveeno get their act together and go back to selling a good product again.</li>
      <li>The comments regarding pressure are true however.  </li>
      <li>You CANNOT do that with this design and just have to press lightly on the trigger button and make sure your hand is completely UNDER the nozzle.</li>
      <li>As long as I keep my good routine and use this shave cream</li>
      <li>Great smooth shaves and alot of cream for little money!</li>
      <li>Evidently they have made a clean getaway.</li>
      <li>Aveeno smells great and it leaves a soft, smooth feel when shaving and your skin doesn&#x27;t feel as dry like</li>
      <li>Guys, let the ladies know that this stuff&#x27;s worth trying.  </li>
      <li>i love this stuff, but it is under too much pressure so it shoots out in a high power streams that gets everywhere.</li>
      <li>Always right out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Right now I have 3 bottles</li>
      <li>So don&#x27;t use it unless you enjoy putting highly absorb-able hormone disruptions and carcinogens into your blood every time that you shave.</li>
      <li>I was actually a bit surprised to find so many people pleased with this product,</li>
      <li>The first two cans were fine, but this morning, I used a new can for the first time, went to put some gel on my hand, and was promptly blinded when the stuff went everywhere, including my eye.  </li>
      <li>Very gentle on my skin and no smell at all.</li>
      <li>Okay, I&#x27;m totally not being funny.</li>
      <li>The first time, when I wasn&#x27;t expecting this, held it a couple of inches from my palm and it richochetted all over the length of my forearm and surrounding wall.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s either a gross mistake in the design, or they purposely made it to force people to waste/use up the product quicker (and hence buy more).  </li>
      <li>I had to rush out of the shower, so much for shaving!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Same same for my legs, even over the ouchiest parts, like my knees, no horrible itchy/burning feeling after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The last thing that I want is a bunch of razorburn and ingrown hairs on the top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;And, speaking of that, when I use Aveeno shave gel, I don&#x27;t get razorburn or ingrown hairs.  </li>
      <li>My skin actually feels better after shaving, with no razorburn or itchiness.</li>
      <li>Ok so I am a guy in my upper 20&#x27;s</li>
      <li>It dispenses well and really lathers!</li>
      <li>All of these ingredients together in a \\&quot;soothing\\&quot; and \\&quot;natural\\&quot; shave gel would be funny if it wasn&#x27;t so dishonest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Less is better sometimes!  </li>
      <li>love this shave gel, its so gentle and you only need very little gel because it turns into a nice amount of lather right away.</li>
      <li>I have used countless products for shaving my arms, legs, and underarms, and they always give me cuts, irritated skin, and have strong scents.</li>
      <li>Try the one by Edge and you will see a *large* similarity.</li>
      <li>works very well and you only need to use a little bit, it works very good for sensitive skin like I have!</li>
      <li>When I finally found this this item I quickly went back and bought 7 more</li>
      <li>In an effort to find a nice-smelling, gentle, shaving gel, I tried this Aveeno.</li>
      <li>Gel\\&quot; in the shower ~1 hour ago and the can is under so much pressure that it shot straight up the shower wall and into my eye.</li>
      <li>Much to my surprise</li>
      <li>Very creamy and sticks to your face regardless of how much you continue to smoosh it around.  </li>
      <li>Once it came back to the market I bought one of each (the therapeutuc oatmeal and positively smooth soy).  </li>
      <li>Am very upset Aveeno repackaged the product like this.  </li>
      <li>Thanks guys</li>
      <li>Feels like someone stabbed me in the eye, thanks Aveeno.</li>
      <li>I understand the frustration of those who find this version to have too much pressure.  </li>
      <li>The contents are under high-pressure, much higher than normal shaving cream.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a whole world of shaving for guys that women don&#x27;t know about.  </li>
      <li>and I will just give it to you straight.</li>
      <li>but it really is.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really feel to need to write a review until I used this product a couple of times</li>
      <li>I went and bought as much as I could.</li>
      <li>I also found out that some of the chemicals used in this product are very carcinogenic.</li>
      <li>I have to shave every day for work, and my skin absolutely hates it.</li>
      <li>It really does feel soothing, I suspect either from the oatmeal or the allantoin.</li>
      <li>My skin isn&#x27;t any more sensitive than the next person&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>I thought I was smart enough to handle this cheap and highly rated product.</li>
      <li>Even though most of this product is washed down the drain, it contains several highly effective penetrating ingredients that allow for instant absorbtion of the product.</li>
      <li>Have used for years, and love it compared to all the other gel brands out there.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad other reviewers have mentioned it.</li>
      <li>Aveeno you need to go back to the original pressure from a couple of years ago.</li>
      <li>It works better than any other creams or gels I have tried.</li>
      <li>I think Aveeno recently discontinued it, and if that&#x27;s true</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although, I&#x27;ve heard reports on Amazon of the can being under too high of pressure, with the propellant shooting out like a jet.</li>
      <li>it took me a few attempts before I was able to dispense it without getting shaving cream all over my bathroom.    </li>
      <li>This is much better than all of the other shaving gels out there, and I&#x27;ve tried all of the major brands.  </li>
      <li>last hint is that although I used to buy the Aveeno brand, I found a generic brand that is just as good for half the price.</li>
      <li>OLD REVIEW-Aveeno should be ashamed for increasing the pressure of the can!</li>
      <li>It would be the exact same thing.  </li>
      <li>Basically same as the original product just is a larger size.  </li>
      <li>I definitely hit a &amp;#34;bullseye&amp;#34; when I went to a certain big red store to find the generic :)</li>
      <li>The gel comes out very fast and on other shave gel bottles, I am used to using my finger to guide the shave gel and prevent it from coming out so fast.</li>
      <li>B00BIL9HZE Nivea For Men Sensitive Shaving Gel]].</li>
      <li>Well, if it has been re-designed, the bottle that I bought was either a just-as-bad remake or still the old design (I bought my bottle in May 2011).</li>
      <li>Product works well on sensitive skin like mine.</li>
      <li>We with sensitive skin...</li>
      <li>Aveeno  acts like its products are all natural with oatmeal ect.</li>
      <li>says that it is dermatologically recommended for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>With this, I am able to shave at least every 3 days and with no pain or irritation.  </li>
      <li>He has sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I never noticed how much longer I was using the same razors until now.  </li>
      <li>It is now 7 ounces instead of the old 9 ounces.</li>
      <li>they&#x27;re almost always gone or nearly gone at stores.</li>
      <li>I like to keep at least 7 because these run out real quick and</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried all the sensitive skin shaving creams.</li>
      <li>Maybe they fixed that problem since those reviews were written.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t even really rate the quality of the product, as I too am a victim of a high pressure shot, bounced off my hand into my eye, and over the towels.</li>
      <li>When you first apply this gel it may feel nice and soothing due to the occasional moisturizing ingredient, but in the long run it will only irritate and dry out your skin.  </li>
      <li>I have to be very careful for the first week or so with a new can.  </li>
      <li>Next can, the pressure was so high it exploded all over the bathroom.</li>
      <li>but I haven&#x27;t notice it doing anything particularly special to put it above (or below) other types.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried shaving with vitamin E oil, pure aloe vera gel, and a brand of shaving gel for dry skin that I can&#x27;t remember the name of.</li>
      <li>That hasn&#x27;t happened to me, but maybe avoid using it in the shower or other hot places just in case.</li>
      <li>The most important part is that it dramatically reduced the number of razor bumps on my neck (my neck was bad, even when I only shaved with the grain).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
      <li>closeouts\\&quot; it&#x27;s possible this could be a discontinued product and Aveeno has fixed this problem.</li>
      <li>Never thought I would try it until the BIG BOX store near me had it on sale.  </li>
      <li>I tried to put a little in my hand and it bounced off of my cupped hand into my right eye.  </li>
      <li>One little dab of gel produces enough rich, thick lather to cover the entire bearded area of one&#x27;s face, which makes it very economical to use.  </li>
      <li>Also in the formulation is isopeptane, methylparaben, propylparaben, ethylparaben and quite a few other pretty shady ingredients that are controversial when it comes to their safety in skincare.</li>
      <li>I guess the first recall that took this off the shelves was to get it dispensing in a less foamy manner.</li>
      <li>this is not the first time and found other posts experiencing the same identical situation w/Aveeno.</li>
      <li>shaving cream has a pleasant almond scent (I guess you&#x27;ll either love it or hate it, but at least it doesn&#x27;t smell like dad&#x27;s Barbasol).</li>
      <li>The only one I haven&#x27;t tried yet is Taylor of Old Bond Street which is currently on the way.</li>
      <li>Not dry, not greasy, just exactly how it was before you started shaving, but a little softer.</li>
      <li>First batch I got, the pressure was so low I had to turn the can upside down to get anything out.</li>
      <li>Also, other companies are creating similar formula gels that are *much* cheaper.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s bad enough that this product contains a known skin irritant, Triethanolamine (or TEA), an Amine produced by the reaction of two known highly toxic substances (Ethylene Oxide and AMONIA,), and has strong evidence supporting that TEA is a human skin, immune system and respiratory toxicant by the U.S. National Library of Medicine, Association of Occupational and Environmental Clinics and the Cosmetic Ingredient Review.</li>
      <li>I did not have any of the high pressure can issues that I read about in other reviews.</li>
      <li>Switching from SatinCare Vanilla Dream Shave Gel to Aveeno Therapeutic Shave Gel with Oatmeal is what has really made the difference in less razor burn for me.</li>
      <li>As the other recent reviewers have said, it shoots out like a high pressured laser beam.  </li>
      <li>My eye started burning badly and I had to wash it for a good 10 minutes</li>

<li> I have had no razor bumps using this gel, and it leaves my skin moisturized and smooth.  </li>
<li> I bought this a few months ago at Wal-Mart, and I am impressed.</li>
<li> We moved to another country which do not have any Aveeno brand available</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used Edge, Gillette, and Nivea shaving gels over the years and all versions are far superior in performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Now that I am finished with all 4 bottles of shaving gel, I bought some of my old brand Gillette shaving gel, smells really good.  </li>
<li> Saw it was available again, and started using it again, since the CVS version, while good, wasn&#x27;t quite the same.  </li>
<li> But they acted as if they&#x27;ve never heard of this (which honestly, I can&#x27;t believe), and would internally relay my problem to the appropriate group.</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving my head on a daily basis for years, and so it is really important for me to get good shaving materials.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Smells simply clean, not chemically.  </li>
<li> It gives a clean, close, moisturizing shave.</li>
<li> and I don&#x27;t have many positive things to say about it.    </li>
<li> It&#x27;s modestly priced, unscented, brushless, gives perfect lubrication and cushioning, softens the hairs, and leaves your skin feeling unaffected.</li>
<li> I used to really like Edge gel, and believe me that this stuff is about three times better than Edge.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
<li> I hope Aveeno get their act together and go back to selling a good product again.</li>
<li> The comments regarding pressure are true however.  </li>
<li> You CANNOT do that with this design and just have to press lightly on the trigger button and make sure your hand is completely UNDER the nozzle.</li>
<li> As long as I keep my good routine and use this shave cream</li>
<li> Great smooth shaves and alot of cream for little money!</li>
<li> Evidently they have made a clean getaway.</li>
<li> Aveeno smells great and it leaves a soft, smooth feel when shaving and your skin doesn&#x27;t feel as dry like</li>
<li> Guys, let the ladies know that this stuff&#x27;s worth trying.  </li>
<li> i love this stuff, but it is under too much pressure so it shoots out in a high power streams that gets everywhere.</li>
<li> Always right out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Right now I have 3 bottles</li>
<li> So don&#x27;t use it unless you enjoy putting highly absorb-able hormone disruptions and carcinogens into your blood every time that you shave.</li>
<li> I was actually a bit surprised to find so many people pleased with this product,</li>
<li> The first two cans were fine, but this morning, I used a new can for the first time, went to put some gel on my hand, and was promptly blinded when the stuff went everywhere, including my eye.  </li>
<li> Very gentle on my skin and no smell at all.</li>
<li> Okay, I&#x27;m totally not being funny.</li>
<li> The first time, when I wasn&#x27;t expecting this, held it a couple of inches from my palm and it richochetted all over the length of my forearm and surrounding wall.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s either a gross mistake in the design, or they purposely made it to force people to waste/use up the product quicker (and hence buy more).  </li>
<li> I had to rush out of the shower, so much for shaving!</li>
<li> /&gt;Same same for my legs, even over the ouchiest parts, like my knees, no horrible itchy/burning feeling after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The last thing that I want is a bunch of razorburn and ingrown hairs on the top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;And, speaking of that, when I use Aveeno shave gel, I don&#x27;t get razorburn or ingrown hairs.  </li>
<li> My skin actually feels better after shaving, with no razorburn or itchiness.</li>
<li> Ok so I am a guy in my upper 20&#x27;s</li>
<li> It dispenses well and really lathers!</li>
<li> All of these ingredients together in a \\&quot;soothing\\&quot; and \\&quot;natural\\&quot; shave gel would be funny if it wasn&#x27;t so dishonest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Less is better sometimes!  </li>
<li> love this shave gel, its so gentle and you only need very little gel because it turns into a nice amount of lather right away.</li>
<li> I have used countless products for shaving my arms, legs, and underarms, and they always give me cuts, irritated skin, and have strong scents.</li>
<li> Try the one by Edge and you will see a *large* similarity.</li>
<li> works very well and you only need to use a little bit, it works very good for sensitive skin like I have!</li>
<li> When I finally found this this item I quickly went back and bought 7 more</li>
<li> In an effort to find a nice-smelling, gentle, shaving gel, I tried this Aveeno.</li>
<li> Gel\\&quot; in the shower ~1 hour ago and the can is under so much pressure that it shot straight up the shower wall and into my eye.</li>
<li> Much to my surprise</li>
<li> Very creamy and sticks to your face regardless of how much you continue to smoosh it around.  </li>
<li> Once it came back to the market I bought one of each (the therapeutuc oatmeal and positively smooth soy).  </li>
<li> Am very upset Aveeno repackaged the product like this.  </li>
<li> Thanks guys</li>
<li> Feels like someone stabbed me in the eye, thanks Aveeno.</li>
<li> I understand the frustration of those who find this version to have too much pressure.  </li>
<li> The contents are under high-pressure, much higher than normal shaving cream.  </li>
<li> There&#x27;s a whole world of shaving for guys that women don&#x27;t know about.  </li>
<li> and I will just give it to you straight.</li>
<li> but it really is.  </li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t really feel to need to write a review until I used this product a couple of times</li>
<li> I went and bought as much as I could.</li>
<li> I also found out that some of the chemicals used in this product are very carcinogenic.</li>
<li> I have to shave every day for work, and my skin absolutely hates it.</li>
<li> It really does feel soothing, I suspect either from the oatmeal or the allantoin.</li>
<li> My skin isn&#x27;t any more sensitive than the next person&#x27;s.  </li>
<li> I thought I was smart enough to handle this cheap and highly rated product.</li>
<li> Even though most of this product is washed down the drain, it contains several highly effective penetrating ingredients that allow for instant absorbtion of the product.</li>
<li> Have used for years, and love it compared to all the other gel brands out there.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m glad other reviewers have mentioned it.</li>
<li> Aveeno you need to go back to the original pressure from a couple of years ago.</li>
<li> It works better than any other creams or gels I have tried.</li>
<li> I think Aveeno recently discontinued it, and if that&#x27;s true</li>
<li> /&gt;Although, I&#x27;ve heard reports on Amazon of the can being under too high of pressure, with the propellant shooting out like a jet.</li>
<li> it took me a few attempts before I was able to dispense it without getting shaving cream all over my bathroom.    </li>
<li> This is much better than all of the other shaving gels out there, and I&#x27;ve tried all of the major brands.  </li>
<li> last hint is that although I used to buy the Aveeno brand, I found a generic brand that is just as good for half the price.</li>
<li> OLD REVIEW-Aveeno should be ashamed for increasing the pressure of the can!</li>
<li> It would be the exact same thing.  </li>
<li> Basically same as the original product just is a larger size.  </li>
<li> I definitely hit a &amp;#34;bullseye&amp;#34; when I went to a certain big red store to find the generic :)</li>
<li> The gel comes out very fast and on other shave gel bottles, I am used to using my finger to guide the shave gel and prevent it from coming out so fast.</li>
<li> B00BIL9HZE Nivea For Men Sensitive Shaving Gel]].</li>
<li> Well, if it has been re-designed, the bottle that I bought was either a just-as-bad remake or still the old design (I bought my bottle in May 2011).</li>
<li> Product works well on sensitive skin like mine.</li>
<li> We with sensitive skin...</li>
<li> Aveeno  acts like its products are all natural with oatmeal ect.</li>
<li> says that it is dermatologically recommended for sensitive skin.  </li>
<li> With this, I am able to shave at least every 3 days and with no pain or irritation.  </li>
<li> He has sensitive skin.</li>
<li> I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
<li> I never noticed how much longer I was using the same razors until now.  </li>
<li> It is now 7 ounces instead of the old 9 ounces.</li>
<li> they&#x27;re almost always gone or nearly gone at stores.</li>
<li> I like to keep at least 7 because these run out real quick and</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried all the sensitive skin shaving creams.</li>
<li> Maybe they fixed that problem since those reviews were written.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t even really rate the quality of the product, as I too am a victim of a high pressure shot, bounced off my hand into my eye, and over the towels.</li>
<li> When you first apply this gel it may feel nice and soothing due to the occasional moisturizing ingredient, but in the long run it will only irritate and dry out your skin.  </li>
<li> I have to be very careful for the first week or so with a new can.  </li>
<li> Next can, the pressure was so high it exploded all over the bathroom.</li>
<li> but I haven&#x27;t notice it doing anything particularly special to put it above (or below) other types.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried shaving with vitamin E oil, pure aloe vera gel, and a brand of shaving gel for dry skin that I can&#x27;t remember the name of.</li>
<li> That hasn&#x27;t happened to me, but maybe avoid using it in the shower or other hot places just in case.</li>
<li> The most important part is that it dramatically reduced the number of razor bumps on my neck (my neck was bad, even when I only shaved with the grain).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
<li> closeouts\\&quot; it&#x27;s possible this could be a discontinued product and Aveeno has fixed this problem.</li>
<li> Never thought I would try it until the BIG BOX store near me had it on sale.  </li>
<li> I tried to put a little in my hand and it bounced off of my cupped hand into my right eye.  </li>
<li> One little dab of gel produces enough rich, thick lather to cover the entire bearded area of one&#x27;s face, which makes it very economical to use.  </li>
<li> Also in the formulation is isopeptane, methylparaben, propylparaben, ethylparaben and quite a few other pretty shady ingredients that are controversial when it comes to their safety in skincare.</li>
<li> I guess the first recall that took this off the shelves was to get it dispensing in a less foamy manner.</li>
<li> this is not the first time and found other posts experiencing the same identical situation w/Aveeno.</li>
<li> shaving cream has a pleasant almond scent (I guess you&#x27;ll either love it or hate it, but at least it doesn&#x27;t smell like dad&#x27;s Barbasol).</li>
<li> The only one I haven&#x27;t tried yet is Taylor of Old Bond Street which is currently on the way.</li>
<li> Not dry, not greasy, just exactly how it was before you started shaving, but a little softer.</li>
<li> First batch I got, the pressure was so low I had to turn the can upside down to get anything out.</li>
<li> Also, other companies are creating similar formula gels that are *much* cheaper.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s bad enough that this product contains a known skin irritant, Triethanolamine (or TEA), an Amine produced by the reaction of two known highly toxic substances (Ethylene Oxide and AMONIA,), and has strong evidence supporting that TEA is a human skin, immune system and respiratory toxicant by the U.S. National Library of Medicine, Association of Occupational and Environmental Clinics and the Cosmetic Ingredient Review.</li>
<li> I did not have any of the high pressure can issues that I read about in other reviews.</li>
<li> Switching from SatinCare Vanilla Dream Shave Gel to Aveeno Therapeutic Shave Gel with Oatmeal is what has really made the difference in less razor burn for me.</li>
<li> As the other recent reviewers have said, it shoots out like a high pressured laser beam.  </li>
<li> My eye started burning badly and I had to wash it for a good 10 minutes</li>
<li> After assuming the first time it blew off my flat hand onto a wall 5 feet away covering a 5x5 area was just a first time pressure issue, I was unfortunate enough to try again.</li>
<li> But, as I have come to find out this very un-natural product that I purchased on Amazon can seriously aggravate sensitive skin conditions.</li>
<li> When you spread it on your face it feels a little denser than a normal shaving cream.</li>
<li> A tiny bit goes a long way which is why the overpressurized can infuriates people including myself.</li>
<li> A tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
<li> It has oatmeal too and cost far less.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve always had issues with dry skin, especially after shaving.</li>
<li> After trying just about every single shaving cream I finally found the one!</li>
<li> I can get just as close as with a brush and shaving cream with a whole lot less mess.  </li>
<li> Having trouble finding Aveeno sensitive shave bell in grocery stores and Target.</li>
<li> If you aren&#x27;t *extra careful, if will ricochet off your hands into the mirror or anywhere else in the bathroom.</li>
<li> At first it was just like any other shaving gel, I reuse my razors a bit and then throw it out when it&#x27;s dull.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my legs for too long!  </li>
<li> the Aveeno body wash my leg&#x27;s aren&#x27;t dry anymore.  </li>
<li> As I type this with one eye as the other one is seriously burning, like hot rocks under my eyelid.</li>
<li> To use now, I have to hold about 6 inches from my hand and press down for literally a fraction of a second.    </li>
<li> When I get my haircut by a new person they always think I have a negative reaction to my shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The ladies ought to know that they aren&#x27;t limited to female-marketed pink products.&lt;br</li>
<li> I should&#x27;ve listened to a previous reviewer who said the gel squirts out really fast and hard.</li>
<li> A few reviewers have complained about the pressure, but I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it exploding or squirting out too fast.</li>
<li> Although it is about twice as expensive as the cheap-end shave gels, I find that it is worth it.&lt;br</li>
<li> Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Propylparaben, Butylparaben, READ THE LABEL people just because it says natural doesnt mean it is.....</li>
<li> Back to plain soap and water for me.</li>
<li> I know it was off the shelves for a while, due to problems with the pump.  </li>
<li> But now it&#x27;s harder to shave, I was spoiled by the Aveeno one!</li>
<li> other shaving creams leave your body feeling.</li>
<li> The active ingredient is colloidal oatmeal, which is clinically proven to help reduce itchy skin.</li>
<li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had read in previous reviews that the design of the nozzle was poor, but I had also read that Aveeno had come out with a new design.</li>
<li> I have struggled with bad razor burn on my upper thighs and armpits for years, but once switching to Aveeno Oatmeal, I noticed a much-better improvement with the first, and every resulting, shave.</li>
<li> &quot; but there is a very distinct smell that emanates and it smells bad in my opinion.</li>
<li> I mean we&#x27;re only shaving legs, not saving lives.</li>
<li> This is for real and it&#x27;s a little scary to think that you could injure yourself shaving your legs.  </li>
<li> recently the pressure they are putting inside the can is ridiculous, you should not end up with shaving cream on an 8ft ceiling when trying to put a dab in your hand...</li>
<li> There is something to their claim of shaving less often.  </li>
<li> However, the fact that it is the THIRD ingredient is just appalling.</li>
<li> Normally I get really bad razor burn, especially on my armpits.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately after a few days of using it in the shower, it ricocheted off my hand and squirted directly into my eye.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t believe that any company could put such poorly tested garbage in customer&#x27;s hands.</li>
<li> This shave gel lists  a few parabens on the list of its ingredients.  </li>
<li> He has super sensitive skin on his face and usually ends up with horrible I-got-attacked-by-grapenuts</li>
<li> The product does have a distinct aroma, but it doesn&#x27;t smell like an irritating artificial fragrance.</li>
<li> That was the problem I had with other shaving gels, they all had a horrible smell of cheap cologne.</li>
<li> However, toward the end of the bottle, it becomes difficult to get the shaving cream out (it seems like the button stop working properly).</li>
<li> It isn&#x27;t at our usual grocery store and I ran out and my legs are like a porcupine on steroids</li>
<li> we are having a hard time finding this product.  </li>
<li> I called and complained to Aveeno customer service.  </li>
<li> and I was screaming and in pain for about at least one hour.</li>
<li> UNBELIEVABLE!</li>
<li> With all these posts, why isn&#x27;t Johnson &amp; Johnson taking this seriously?  </li>
<li> I just find that it is very annoying that the shave gel squirts out too quickly.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s  very hard to locate in my area.  </li>
<li> This is frustrating, but I will still be purchasing this shave gel again when it runs out, resulting in my 4/5 star rating.</li>
<li> I lived 10 years in the US and I became addicted to this product.</li>
<li> The ingredients list of this \\&quot;therapeutic\\&quot; shave gel reads like a veritable feast of potentially irritating and harmful chemicals and compounds.</li>
<li> they seriously need to address this!</li>
<li> I could not see for about 5 minutes (pretty scary when you&#x27;re all alone in the house, my husband is away on business), and the pain was horrible.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, the gel is thin, watered-down, doesn&#x27;t foam up well, and doesn&#x27;t stick well to your skin.</li>
<li> Sadly this item has been discontinued...</li>
<li> I know it sounds exaggerated</li>
<li> you won&#x27;t be sorry</li>
<li> STAY AWAY FROM THIS DANGEROUS PRODUCT.</li>
<li> It was extremely painful and difficult to flush out and was disorienting for about 10 minutes.</li>
<li> is so painful.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m so disappointed.  </li>
<li> /&gt;It shouldn&#x27;t be all that difficult - the CVS store brand doesn&#x27;t seem to have this issue!!</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know who the idiot was that designed this product</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> love this shave gel, its so gentle and you only need very little gel because it turns into a nice amount of lather right away. i will and have repurchased many times.</li>
    <li> In an effort to find a nice-smelling, gentle, shaving gel, I tried this Aveeno. It really smells great - like a pastry kitchen. Unfortunately, the gel is thin, watered-down, doesn&#x27;t foam up well, and doesn&#x27;t stick well to your skin. I&#x27;ve used Edge, Gillette, and Nivea shaving gels over the years and all versions are far superior in performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for an alternative to this Aveeno, I would recommend [[ASIN:B00BIL9HZE Nivea For Men Sensitive Shaving Gel]].</li>
    <li> Contacted the manufacturer and they hope to have it back on shelves before the end of 2010.  I&#x27;m dying here!  I LOVE this stuff!</li>
    <li> this shaving cream smells amazing and leaves my skin feeling great, but dear god the can... it took me a few attempts before I was able to dispense it without getting shaving cream all over my bathroom.    I learned to hold it about 6\\&quot; away from my hand and only press the nozzle for a second.</li>
    <li> Okay, I&#x27;m totally not being funny. This is for real and it&#x27;s a little scary to think that you could injure yourself shaving your legs.  As I type this with one eye as the other one is seriously burning, like hot rocks under my eyelid. I was using Aveeno \\&quot;Positively Smooth Shave Gel\\&quot; in the shower ~1 hour ago and the can is under so much pressure that it shot straight up the shower wall and into my eye. OHMYGOD it stung like hell! I flooded my eye with water and still can&#x27;t open the eye.  Went online to find what to do since it&#x27;s burning is so painful. Much to my surprise this is not the first time and found other posts experiencing the same identical situation w/Aveeno. What the heck, why do we need firehose pressure on a can of shaving cream for god sake?! I mean we&#x27;re only shaving legs, not saving lives. Back to plain soap and water for me. With all these posts, why isn&#x27;t Johnson &amp; Johnson taking this seriously?  UNBELIEVABLE!</li>
    <li> Aveeno shave gel is a great product to stop ingrown hairs and limit cuts created by shaving.  I suggest this product for men because it helped stop a lot of the skin problems that shaving caused.  It also helps limit the skin problems created by using multiblade razors, such as the Mach III and Schick Quattro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is faint, but it isn&#x27;t the greatest and the product is expensive.  You can try Aveeno&#x27;s better smelling alternative shave cream called Positively Smooth.  Also, other companies are creating similar formula gels that are *much* cheaper.  Try the one by Edge and you will see a *large* similarity.</li>
    <li> Sadly this item has been discontinued...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try CVS Therapeutic Shave Gel SKU #452107. It has oatmeal too and cost far less.</li>
    <li> Aveeno has indicated there were problems with the pump so it has been removed temporarily but they hope to have back on shelves before the end of 2010. Hoping that&#x27;s correct ... it&#x27;s my favorite shave cream for years.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used and it&#x27;s  very hard to locate in my area.  I would suggest to anybody  to try it !!!</li>
    <li> i love this stuff, but it is under too much pressure so it shoots out in a high power streams that gets everywhere.</li>
    <li> Aveeno fragrance-free shave gel is a perfect product, and I&#x27;m distressed that it is no longer available for purchase at retail outlets.  One little dab of gel produces enough rich, thick lather to cover the entire bearded area of one&#x27;s face, which makes it very economical to use.  And the best part is that there is absolutely NO annoying perfume in it.</li>
    <li> Love the PRODUCT.  I know it was off the shelves for a while, due to problems with the pump.  Saw it was available again, and started using it again, since the CVS version, while good, wasn&#x27;t quite the same.  The first two cans were fine, but this morning, I used a new can for the first time, went to put some gel on my hand, and was promptly blinded when the stuff went everywhere, including my eye.  I could not see for about 5 minutes (pretty scary when you&#x27;re all alone in the house, my husband is away on business), and the pain was horrible.  Even now, a good three hours since it happened, my eye stings a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aveeno needs to take this product off the shelves again, and keep it off the shelves unless and until this problem is resolved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shouldn&#x27;t be all that difficult - the CVS store brand doesn&#x27;t seem to have this issue!!</li>
    <li> The gel in and of itself deserves five stars. Switching from SatinCare Vanilla Dream Shave Gel to Aveeno Therapeutic Shave Gel with Oatmeal is what has really made the difference in less razor burn for me. I have struggled with bad razor burn on my upper thighs and armpits for years, but once switching to Aveeno Oatmeal, I noticed a much-better improvement with the first, and every resulting, shave. Although it is about twice as expensive as the cheap-end shave gels, I find that it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had read in previous reviews that the design of the nozzle was poor, but I had also read that Aveeno had come out with a new design. Well, if it has been re-designed, the bottle that I bought was either a just-as-bad remake or still the old design (I bought my bottle in May 2011). The gel comes out very fast and on other shave gel bottles, I am used to using my finger to guide the shave gel and prevent it from coming out so fast. You CANNOT do that with this design and just have to press lightly on the trigger button and make sure your hand is completely UNDER the nozzle. This is frustrating, but I will still be purchasing this shave gel again when it runs out, resulting in my 4/5 star rating.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aveeno for the longest time but recently the pressure they are putting inside the can is ridiculous, you should not end up with shaving cream on an 8ft ceiling when trying to put a dab in your hand...they seriously need to address this!</li>
    <li> I bought a can 4/12 and starting using it immediately.I held the can about one inch from my palm and squirted it into the palm w/no problems. I think Aveeno has solved the pressure problem.If in doubt wear goggles or plastic glasses when squirting.Product works well on sensitive skin like mine.</li>
    <li> Love the product. Have used for years, and love it compared to all the other gel brands out there. Very creamy and sticks to your face regardless of how much you continue to smoosh it around.  I was upset they took it off the shelves a while back to redesign the dispensing.  Once it came back to the market I bought one of each (the therapeutuc oatmeal and positively smooth soy).  As the other recent reviewers have said, it shoots out like a high pressured laser beam.  It did this with both cans.  The first time, when I wasn&#x27;t expecting this, held it a couple of inches from my palm and it richochetted all over the length of my forearm and surrounding wall.  Fortunately, it did not go into my eyes.  To use now, I have to hold about 6 inches from my hand and press down for literally a fraction of a second.    Am very upset Aveeno repackaged the product like this.  It&#x27;s either a gross mistake in the design, or they purposely made it to force people to waste/use up the product quicker (and hence buy more).  I called and complained to Aveeno customer service.  The lady was very nice, and mailed me a couple of replacement coupons.  But they acted as if they&#x27;ve never heard of this (which honestly, I can&#x27;t believe), and would internally relay my problem to the appropriate group.</li>
    <li> all ingredients are not listed on amazon.  i had to return it because of some allergy type ingredients, such as paraben, a known carcinogen.</li>
    <li> Love this gel, it feels great on my face, takes care of my skin and I get a great shave!</li>
    <li> ***UPDATE.. Aveeno has changed the pressure recently so I changed my review from 1 star to 5 stars! Thanks guys this is the best shave gel out there for my sensitive skin and also has the best fragrance ***  OLD REVIEW-Aveeno should be ashamed for increasing the pressure of the can! It is wasteful (but you use the product more quickly so then you have to buy another can!...shame shame shame aveeno, cheap way to make money. I&#x27;m glad other reviewers have mentioned it. Aveeno you need to go back to the original pressure from a couple of years ago.</li>
    <li> This is the best shave gel I&#x27;ve ever tried. Why put it in an aerosol can?????! Take out the isopentane and the isobutane and put in a tube!!! It would be the exact same thing.  This shave gel works to an excellent lather. I use a DE razor and brush. It works better than any other creams or gels I have tried. The only one I haven&#x27;t tried yet is Taylor of Old Bond Street which is currently on the way. A tiny bit goes a long way which is why the overpressurized can infuriates people including myself. I say you don&#x27;t need the can period! Break from the norm...or should I say go back to the traditional ways! Less is better sometimes!  Update:  11/15/11  This shave cream while it does provide a nice shave leaves my cheeks burning red! I don&#x27;t know what ingredient it is but something doesn&#x27;t work well with it...</li>
    <li> Glad the Aveeno \\&quot;reissued\\&quot; this product.  Basically same as the original product just is a larger size.  Only shaving cream that works for me....and I have tried a ton.  We with sensitive skin...thank Aveeno...keep them going.</li>
    <li> Works so much better than soap. A tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> The product, itself, is good. It provides a nice, smooth shave. However, toward the end of the bottle, it becomes difficult to get the shaving cream out (it seems like the button stop working properly). It&#x27;s a shame, because this used to be the only shaving cream I used.</li>
    <li> I should&#x27;ve listened to a previous reviewer who said the gel squirts out really fast and hard. I thought I was smart enough to handle this cheap and highly rated product. Unfortunately after a few days of using it in the shower, it ricocheted off my hand and squirted directly into my eye. It felt like a bee stung my eye and I was screaming and in pain for about at least one hour. I don&#x27;t know who the idiot was that designed this product but they need to be FIRED! Obviously he or she never used this product on a daily basis.     Note: I bought this item thru Amazon from a company called \\&quot;Best closeouts\\&quot; it&#x27;s possible this could be a discontinued product and Aveeno has fixed this problem. If that&#x27;s true then shame on \\&quot;Best closeouts\\&quot; for selling me a known problem.</li>
    <li> Aveeno  acts like its products are all natural with oatmeal ect. Yet it contains four different parabens which are know to cause cancer..Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Propylparaben, Butylparaben, READ THE LABEL people just because it says natural doesnt mean it is.....</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even really rate the quality of the product, as I too am a victim of a high pressure shot, bounced off my hand into my eye, and over the towels. Feels like someone stabbed me in the eye, thanks Aveeno. Good thing I am staying in tonight.  I am definitely going to be writing that company and letting them know they should FIX this. Seems I am not the first one!!!  I will be showing them some pictures.  So go ahead buy this product, but shoot it in an enclosed bag!! I had to rush out of the shower, so much for shaving!</li>
    <li> I prefer shaving with a tube cream, but I keep some gel on hand.  Aveeno is the only gel I will use, and have used, for years.  It was touch-and-go there for a while when Aveeno re-worked the can, and I was overjoyed to see it back on the shelves. The gel is very soothing on my skin, and it gives me a great shave.  I understand the frustration of those who find this version to have too much pressure.  Frankly, though, I never noticed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my legs for too long!  This is THE BEST product I have ever used.  I think Aveeno recently discontinued it, and if that&#x27;s true I&#x27;m so disappointed.  If it shows up at discount stores, I&#x27;m stocking up.</li>
    <li> Hi! My husband like this shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Aveeno, fragrance free lotion so when I spotted this product on a regular store visit, I jumped at the chance to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now my hubby and I wont use anything else.  He has super sensitive skin on his face and usually ends up with horrible I-got-attacked-by-grapenuts razor burn whenever he shaves, but with this shave gel, the irritation is greatly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Same same for my legs, even over the ouchiest parts, like my knees, no horrible itchy/burning feeling after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we are having a hard time finding this product.  It isn&#x27;t at our usual grocery store and I ran out and my legs are like a porcupine on steroids and I still can&#x27;t bear the thought of using something else to shave.</li>
    <li> This is much better than all of the other shaving gels out there, and I&#x27;ve tried all of the major brands.  In fact, the way that I found Aveeno was on my continual quest to get the best shave by trying new products.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving my head on a daily basis for years, and so it is really important for me to get good shaving materials.  The last thing that I want is a bunch of razorburn and ingrown hairs on the top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;And, speaking of that, when I use Aveeno shave gel, I don&#x27;t get razorburn or ingrown hairs.  When I don&#x27;t use Aveeno, then I do.  I used to really like Edge gel, and believe me that this stuff is about three times better than Edge.&lt;br /&gt;This says that it is dermatologically recommended for sensitive skin.  It is good for people with all types of skin--My skin isn&#x27;t any more sensitive than the next person&#x27;s.  Aveeno just gives you a really good shave.&lt;br /&gt;My wife also likes to use this on her legs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this gel for five years. Fantastic gel, the best out there. Recently, Aveeno has started messing with the aerosol dispenser. First batch I got, the pressure was so low I had to turn the can upside down to get anything out. Next can, the pressure was so high it exploded all over the bathroom. I can&#x27;t believe that any company could put such poorly tested garbage in customer&#x27;s hands. I bet some VP at J&amp;J decided this would be a great way to increase profit. I hope Aveeno get their act together and go back to selling a good product again.</li>
    <li> Normally I get really bad razor burn, especially on my armpits.  With this, I am able to shave at least every 3 days and with no pain or irritation.  LOVE THIS STUFF</li>
    <li> The contents are under high-pressure, much higher than normal shaving cream.  I tried to put a little in my hand and it bounced off of my cupped hand into my right eye.  My eye started burning badly and I had to wash it for a good 10 minutes but it still hurts and is all red.  This has never happened to me before.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS DANGEROUS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I guess the first recall that took this off the shelves was to get it dispensing in a less foamy manner. Now it dispenses like a shave gel bomb. After assuming the first time it blew off my flat hand onto a wall 5 feet away covering a 5x5 area was just a first time pressure issue, I was unfortunate enough to try again. This time dispensing into a cupped hand, it exploded up onto my face and in my eyes and onto the mirror and ceiling. It was extremely painful and difficult to flush out and was disorienting for about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff. Works wonders for my skin and leaves no bumps or rashes. Great smooth shaves and alot of cream for little money!</li>
    <li> great for sensitive skin. probably one of the only options I have used over the years that does not make my legs get a rash or itch after use.</li>
    <li> This stuff&#x27;s great.  Between this and the Aveeno body wash my leg&#x27;s aren&#x27;t dry anymore.  Yep, it&#x27;s not just for guys.  Guys, let the ladies know that this stuff&#x27;s worth trying.  There&#x27;s a whole world of shaving for guys that women don&#x27;t know about.  Your razors are way better than ours and so is this shave gel.  The ladies ought to know that they aren&#x27;t limited to female-marketed pink products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells simply clean, not chemically.  Bargain price.</li>
    <li> My skin actually feels better after shaving, with no razorburn or itchiness. Plus it smells kind of like cherries.</li>
    <li> consistently the best shaving creamor sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Having trouble finding Aveeno sensitive shave bell in grocery stores and Target. This happened before when they took it off the market to change the cans spout. My husband loves this gel. He has sensitive skin. This gel does not irritate or have a scent. Loves it.</li>
    <li> Definitely the Best shaving cream I&#x27;ve used, incredible after a hot shower.</li>
    <li> Ok so I am a guy in my upper 20&#x27;s and I will just give it to you straight. I have extremely sensitive skin. When someone cuts my hair or touches, scrapes me leaves lines. When I get my haircut by a new person they always think I have a negative reaction to my shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I shaved before I almost always god bumps. I use a good razor. Always right out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to this cream and I have been blown away. As long as I keep my good routine and use this shave cream I am bio free. So impressed will buy again.</li>
    <li> This shave gel lists  a few parabens on the list of its ingredients.  So don&#x27;t use it unless you enjoy putting highly absorb-able hormone disruptions and carcinogens into your blood every time that you shave.</li>
    <li> Finally, a shaving cream that has no scent!!!</li>
    <li> I know it sounds exaggerated but it really is.  Never thought I would try it until the BIG BOX store near me had it on sale.  Bought a 4 pack to try and it is easily the best shaving gel I tried.  At first it was just like any other shaving gel, I reuse my razors a bit and then throw it out when it&#x27;s dull.  Now that I am finished with all 4 bottles of shaving gel, I bought some of my old brand Gillette shaving gel, smells really good.  But now it&#x27;s harder to shave, I was spoiled by the Aveeno one! LOL.  Not only that, I am throwing out my razors a lot faster.  I never noticed how much longer I was using the same razors until now.  I never thought I would be praising shaving gel, perhaps the scents but not the gel use itself.  A grade stuff.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really feel to need to write a review until I used this product a couple of times and I don&#x27;t have many positive things to say about it.    There are several things that I notice with Aveeno&#x27;s shave gel:    1. I just find that it is very annoying that the shave gel squirts out too quickly. Emphasis on TOO QUICKLY! If you aren&#x27;t *extra careful, if will ricochet off your hands into the mirror or anywhere else in the bathroom. (Happened to me numerous times). Product will definitely run out in no time.    2. It says \\&quot;no fragrance added\\&quot; but there is a very distinct smell that emanates and it smells bad in my opinion. Maybe some fragrance is needed.    I was actually a bit surprised to find so many people pleased with this product, but to each their own. I think R&amp;D needs to go back and work on the squeeze mechanism.</li>
    <li> This is THE best drugstore shaving cream ever made. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, it smells like oatmeal with vanilla... mmm. I have used countless products for shaving my arms, legs, and underarms, and they always give me cuts, irritated skin, and have strong scents. This is great for men,also, since it doesn&#x27;t smell feminine. It gives a clean, close, moisturizing shave. It dispenses well and really lathers! One of my holy grail products.</li>
    <li> This stuff was great. Very gentle on my skin and no smell at all. Most shaving creams irritate my legs but this one was perfect.</li>
    <li> This is easily the best gel out there and I have tried them all.  The comments regarding pressure are true however.  I have to be very careful for the first week or so with a new can.  That aside the stuff is fantastic!</li>
    <li> Have tried many shave creams and gels...this is the best!&lt;br /&gt;No smell, no razor burn, face feels like a millions dollars after using it.&lt;br /&gt;Try it...you won&#x27;t be sorry</li>
    <li> In 2012 they discontinued Aveeno shave cream for \\&quot;design flaws\\&quot; they said. I went and bought as much as I could. A year later Aveeno came back on the shelves 2 OUNCES LIGHTER!!! It is now 7 ounces instead of the old 9 ounces. You cannot find any evidence of this on the internet. Evidently they have made a clean getaway. I now buy Target generic. I will never buy Aveeno again.</li>
    <li> I lived 10 years in the US and I became addicted to this product. After I moved to Europe I tried different products, but none was even close to Aveeno. If you are in Europe and don&#x27;t want to pay exorbitant shipping fees, order from CHICHESTERS PHARMACY &amp; GIFTS.</li>
    <li> I originally felt that this product was really great and \\&quot;natural\\&quot;. But, as I have come to find out this very un-natural product that I purchased on Amazon can seriously aggravate sensitive skin conditions. I also found out that some of the chemicals used in this product are very carcinogenic.</li>
    <li> After trying just about every single shaving cream I finally found the one! Aveeno smells great and it leaves a soft, smooth feel when shaving and your skin doesn&#x27;t feel as dry like other shaving creams leave your body feeling. That was the problem I had with other shaving gels, they all had a horrible smell of cheap cologne. I used Dove soap for a while but that didn&#x27;t have a great feel. When I finally found this this item I quickly went back and bought 7 more bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another sign this is a great product- they&#x27;re almost always gone or nearly gone at stores. Right now I have 3 bottles and I consider that low. I like to keep at least 7 because these run out real quick and the stores never know when they&#x27;re going to come in. For Amazon to have this product available, it simply makes it great because now I don&#x27;t have to leave my house and can buy as many of these as I want.</li>
    <li> The ingredients list of this \\&quot;therapeutic\\&quot; shave gel reads like a veritable feast of potentially irritating and harmful chemicals and compounds. When you first apply this gel it may feel nice and soothing due to the occasional moisturizing ingredient, but in the long run it will only irritate and dry out your skin.  It&#x27;s bad enough that this product contains a known skin irritant, Triethanolamine (or TEA), an Amine produced by the reaction of two known highly toxic substances (Ethylene Oxide and AMONIA,), and has strong evidence supporting that TEA is a human skin, immune system and respiratory toxicant by the U.S. National Library of Medicine, Association of Occupational and Environmental Clinics and the Cosmetic Ingredient Review. However, the fact that it is the THIRD ingredient is just appalling. Also in the formulation is isopeptane, methylparaben, propylparaben, ethylparaben and quite a few other pretty shady ingredients that are controversial when it comes to their safety in skincare. Even though most of this product is washed down the drain, it contains several highly effective penetrating ingredients that allow for instant absorbtion of the product. All of these ingredients together in a \\&quot;soothing\\&quot; and \\&quot;natural\\&quot; shave gel would be funny if it wasn&#x27;t so dishonest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therapeutic? Nope. Please don&#x27;t just take my word for it, but look up these chemicals for yourself and then choose whether this is something you want to be putting on your skin.</li>
    <li> I guess I can say I&#x27;ve tried every form of pre/post shaving conditioner available at most retail outlets, e.g., gels, creams, foams, bars, lotions, and so on. This product provides the results that I want and expect from a toiletry!</li>
    <li> I was told that that using this shaving gel would be a fantastic experience! True! I did not have any of the high pressure can issues that I read about in other reviews. Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have to shave every day for work, and my skin absolutely hates it. I&#x27;ve tried all the sensitive skin shaving creams. This is the best one out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaving cream has a pleasant almond scent (I guess you&#x27;ll either love it or hate it, but at least it doesn&#x27;t smell like dad&#x27;s Barbasol). When you spread it on your face it feels a little denser than a normal shaving cream. The active ingredient is colloidal oatmeal, which is clinically proven to help reduce itchy skin. Colloidal oatmeal is not what you eat for breakfast! The most important part is that it dramatically reduced the number of razor bumps on my neck (my neck was bad, even when I only shaved with the grain).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last hint is that although I used to buy the Aveeno brand, I found a generic brand that is just as good for half the price. I definitely hit a &amp;#34;bullseye&amp;#34; when I went to a certain big red store to find the generic :)</li>
    <li> Nice shaving cream. Didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because I may get razor bumps every now and then.</li>
    <li> I have had no razor bumps using this gel, and it leaves my skin moisturized and smooth.  I will never use any other shave gel again, this stuff is great!</li>
    <li> There is something to their claim of shaving less often.  I can get just as close as with a brush and shaving cream with a whole lot less mess.  Your skin will feel better too.</li>
    <li> works very well and you only need to use a little bit, it works very good for sensitive skin like I have!</li>
    <li> This is the best shave gel there is period, the steel can was better but the product is the best</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had issues with dry skin, especially after shaving. I&#x27;ve tried shaving with vitamin E oil, pure aloe vera gel, and a brand of shaving gel for dry skin that I can&#x27;t remember the name of. I bought this a few months ago at Wal-Mart, and I am impressed. Now, I have no irritation at all after shaving. The product does have a distinct aroma, but it doesn&#x27;t smell like an irritating artificial fragrance. I can&#x27;t decide if it is from the oatmeal or another ingredient, but I find it pleasant. It really does feel soothing, I suspect either from the oatmeal or the allantoin. A few reviewers have complained about the pressure, but I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it exploding or squirting out too fast. Maybe they fixed that problem since those reviews were written.</li>
    <li> Aveeno makes great products and this is just one of them.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving gel/foam/cream/soap I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s modestly priced, unscented, brushless, gives perfect lubrication and cushioning, softens the hairs, and leaves your skin feeling unaffected. Not dry, not greasy, just exactly how it was before you started shaving, but a little softer. Incredible product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, I&#x27;ve heard reports on Amazon of the can being under too high of pressure, with the propellant shooting out like a jet. That hasn&#x27;t happened to me, but maybe avoid using it in the shower or other hot places just in case.</li>
    <li> I have MCS, Multiple Chemical Sensitivities, and this is the only brand in stores that I can use. No fragrance. Works way better than the stuff I bought at the health food stores. As another customer mentioned, it&#x27;s not just for men. I don&#x27;t know why they had it in the men&#x27;s section at the store.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only shaving gel he&#x27;ll use.  We moved to another country which do not have any Aveeno brand available so we need to stock them and take them home with us.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s shaving cream, and it smells real nice. Otherwise it works pretty good but I haven&#x27;t notice it doing anything particularly special to put it above (or below) other types.</li>
</ol>
